# Japan 2019 Trip 2

## Preparation

## Take-off

The Premium Economy seat is definitely an upgrade over my typical coach seat on the way to Japan. It came with both a blanket, and slippers for my comfort. Also, they have Shochu on the menu, so I plan to enjoy a few cocktails while flying.

I downloaded *so* much content for the flight, and so I should be more than ready for around 10 hours of flying. Hopefully it’s restful and I can sleep a little as well. My plan is to nap after dinner for a little while, then sleep a bit. Unfortunately, the plane isn’t one of the newest ones, so I don’t think the air will be humid enough, but I brought my saline spray to help with that. I’d love to stay healthy this entire trip.

### Dinner

Diner was two shochus, a beer, and a meal of chicken teriyaki. I played a lot of Outlanders, a town-building game, and listened to podcasts. It turns out that games eat battery a lot faster than tv shows, so I ended-up with 36% battery less than halfway through the flight. 

They turned the lights out around 8pm PST (noon in Tokyo), but I wasn’t super tired, so I kept writing and listening to podcasts.

Got the in-flight “udon de sky” which were cute thin cup udon and some water. Watched more tv, then hit the bathroom, and found this weird wet mask that supposedly helps with humidity in the plane. We’ll see if it’s effective or not.

Next was podcasts, and charging, while I caught up on this doc.

## Night One

Hung with Brian and Kenna in Shibuya-Ku, then we went to Koenji, checked into my hotel, and went to get yakitori. Had a night cap at my hotel, then slept.

## On my way to Kyoto

Spent the morning buying the new AirPods Pro at the Shinjuku Apple Store, which annoyingly took around 2 and a half hours. Afterwards I went to Shinjuku station and then to Tokyo station. Now, I’m on a Hikari Shinkansen on my way to Kyoto for two days at a Gion Ryokan.

Yoshiima was pretty cute, if a little quaint. The food was good, but unfortunately I couldn’t use the cedar baths because of my tattoos. Oh well.

I spent the day traveling around to different coffee shops, and doing a little bit of shopping as well. I went to Travelling Coffee Shop, Weekender’s, and Dongree.

Dinner was Beef Sukiyaki, and I’m sure it in no small part contributed to some stomach issues due to the konjac.

## Osaka

Made it to my new apartment and settled-in. I was very tired for some reason, so I ended up watching tv and napping before going out for fantastic fried chicken.

Afterwards, I was super stuffed, so I came home and got ready for bed. 12 hours of sleep later, and I’m hopefully ready for a day of wandering.

### Day 2

Woke up, quaffed some canned Boss Black, then headed out to Ciatre for a cup of Ethiopian.

Afterwards I got some awesome ramen, then walked around and went to a bookstore and got more coffee.

Later, I had dinner with Ray and Stephan at a Vietnamese place. It was pretty good.
