1. **Reaquainted with Life** – Kokumo

2. **The Kingdom of Gods** – NK Jemison

3. **Slice Harvester** – Colin Atrophy Hagendorf

4. **The Inheritance Trilogy** – NK Jemison

5. **The Remedy** – Zena Sherman

6. **Texts from Jane Eyre** – Mallory Ortberg

    I didn't understand half of this, because Mallory & I have divergent
    tastes, but she gave me a European paperback, so I read it finally after it
    being sold out in a bunch of places. Love her.

7. **Freedom is a Constant Struggle** – Angela Davis [**](#ghost)

    This was a coven book club book. It was lovely, but also super repetitive,
    because most of the talks/essays were written/given around the same time,
    so the themes & topics are the same. Important, but I probably didn't need
    to read them all.

8. **The Small Backs of Children** – Lydia Yuknavitch

20. **For Your Own Good** – Leah Horlick

21. **Difficult Women** – Roxanne Gay

22. **Exit West** – Moisin Hamid [**](#ghost)

    Another book club book. This was a really neat exploration of immigration,
    family, and place. I super loved this book.

23. **Sex Object** – Jessica Valenti

43. **Monstress Vol.2: The Blood** – Marjorie Liu

44. **Murcielago Vol.2** – Yoshinarakana

45. **Motor Crush Vol.1** – Babs Tarr

    I'm really stoked on this queer lady motorcycle racing comic. Like, damn. I
    can't wait for the next one. The art is fantastic, and the story is a
    little light, but hints at a lot more. The world seems interesting. Why do
    the motorcyles get addicted?

46. **The Idiot** – Elif Batuman

47. **My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness** – Kabi Nagata

48. **Hard Boiled & Hard Luck** – Banana Yoshimoto

    A nice slice-of life, that's sad in a way that is very refreshing in the
    summmer. These books are about losses, and how to cope and move forward.
    I'm really enjoying rediscovering Banana Yoshimoto's writing.

50. **Bittersweet** – Nevada Barr [*](#les)

    An easy-enough read, but the story was too "femme danger & butch power" for
    me. The "love" story takes place between a late-20s/early-30s woman and a
    teenager (gross), and at a certain point they basically agree that if a man
    tries to marry Sarah, she'll just go along – bc obviously femme women are
    just waiting for a man, and butches have to fight those men off bc we have
    no agency. I dunno. This author is also, AFAIK straight... which is doubly
    strange. Weird shit happens in this, and maybe it's worth reading if you're
    super into the 19th century "west," but the adult on teen predatory love
    and the bullshit masc > femme stuff is really not my bag.

51. **Zodiac Starforce: By the Power of Astra** – Kevin Panetta

    Cute sailor-moon-style girl team of fighters. Really enjoyed how this was
    drawn, and the queerness of a few of the characters. If you need something
    lighthearted, it's worth a read.

52. **Generation Loss** – Elizabeth Hand

    I'd only read Fire, a short story collection by Hand, before and wasn't
    sure what to expect. It was exciting expecting this to be odd literary
    fiction, then discovering it's a moody mystery. Definitely fun, and odd,
    and great.

53. **Witches, Sluts, Feminists** – Kristen J. Sollee [**](#ghost)

    This was a decent non-fiction exploration of witches & to a degree, sluts &
    feminists through the ages. It focuses primarily on the Americas, and
    despite my usual disinterest in non-fiction this was fun and informative
    enough to carry me through on a camping trip during the eclipse. Time to
    find some DMT for my flying broom.

54. **God's War** – Kameron Hurley

    Queer bounty hunters, devout magicians, and so much sand intermingled in
    this fun ride through a Islam-based religion colonized planet where organs
    are bought and sold, and a war between two countries rages on pointlessly.
    I wanted to stay in this world for longer, as new wrinkles kept being
    added. Luckily, there's a sequel.

55. **The Stone Sky** – NK Jemison

    Wow, this was a fantastic ending to a delightful trilogy. Loved this story
    of family, world-rending powers, and ecology. Seriously one of the best
    things I've read in years, in fantasy or literature.

56. **The Merry Spinster** – Mallory Ortberg

    Review forthcoming when this book actually comes out.

57. **Notes from a Crocodile**

    This book was such a lovely combination of melanchholy feelings, and
    slightly obsessive lesbian love. I loved all of the Abe references.
