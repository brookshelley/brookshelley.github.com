## 2017

1. **Reaquainted with Life** – Kokumo

- **The Kingdom of Gods** – NK Jemison

- **Slice Harvester** – Colin Atrophy Hagendorf

- **The Inheritance Trilogy** – NK Jemison

- **The Remedy** – Zena Sherman

  - I didn't understand half of this, because Mallory & I have divergent tastes, but she gave me a European paperback, so I read it finally after it being sold out in a bunch of places. Love her.

- **Freedom is a Constant Struggle** – Angela Davis
  - This was a coven book club book. It was lovely, but also super repetative, because most of the talks/essays were written/given around the same time, so the themes & topics are the same. Important, but I probably didn't need to read them all.
