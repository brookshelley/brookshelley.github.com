5. **The Remedy** – Zena Sherman

6. **Texts from Jane Eyre** – Mallory Ortberg
I didn't understand half of this, because Mallory & I have divergent tastes, but she gave me a European paperback, so I read it finally after it being sold out in a bunch of places. Love her.

7. **Freedom is a Constant Struggle** – Angela Davis
This was a coven book club book. It was lovely, but also super repetative,
because most of the talks/essays were written/given around the same time, so
the themes & topics are the same. Important, but I probably didn't need to read
them all.
