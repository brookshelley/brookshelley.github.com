### 38 Books

**Love & Estrogen** — Samantha Allen

I don't usually read trans memoir—and I have a forthcoming piece that challenges and lampoons it to a degree—but Samantha is a friend and her story is close to my heart because of that. I had the chance to chat with her a lot through the course of part of this love and transition story, and I enjoyed the way she told it. This memoir definitely touched on some of the tropes of the genre, but by also being a wonderful love story, it manages to eschew many more.

**The Tea Master & the Detective** — Aliette de Bodard [**](#ghost)

This was a fun detective tale with a mysterious Sherlock and a spaceship Watson. The setup never quite paid off with its mystery, but I look forward to reading more hooks in the series. I also worried a bit that it would fetishize or exoticize Chinese culture, but outside of the space-protection tea, it largely doesn't come up.

**State Tectonics** -- Malka Older

A fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn't love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.

**Convenience Store Woman** — Sayaka Murata [**](#ghost)

Wow. This book was a lot more bizarre than I expected based on the recommendations I'd read—more Abe than H. Murakami. I loved the narrator, and the rich descriptions of convenience store life. This book was hilarious and wild. One of my favorites this year.

**Would You Rather** — Katie Heaney

A touching memoir of coming-out and learning that past dating disinterest was just latent sapphism, lol. There's a lot to love about this book, and also quite a bit of cringe. It's a coming-of-age in a way, and overall I'd recommend it to young dykes and old, or anyone wondering if their sexuality is "real".

**Worth the Wait** — Karelia Stetz-Waters [*](les)

This was a corny AF lesbian romance. Lots of random sex, and a main plot of "the cute femme can't come out bc reasons". Nothing groundbreaking, but it was an easy read.

**Record of a Spaceborn Few** — Becky Chambers

This was a much slower-paced book than the previous two, and was largely a slice of life about Exodans—the humans who left Earth to take their chances in the universe after Earth became uninhabitable. I enjoyed the various characters, the queer relationships, and the color added to this way of life. Sometimes it's nice to have a space scifi book that isn't full of lasers and danger.

**Fingersmith** — Sarah Waters [*](#les)

In an odd turn of fate, I'd seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so
the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean
director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but
Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the
page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that's likely because
I devoted little time to reading. I'm glad I finished this, and recommend
it if you love multi-layered, deftly-woven stories.

**Empire Ascendant** — Kameron Hurley

A wild second installment in the Mirror Empire trilogy that is so
chock-full of characters and their (spoiler alert) doubles, that I got a
bit confused. There's a glossary and character list in the back, but dang,
this is some GoT stuff. I enjoyed the descent into chaos in this book, and
I'm eagerly anticipating the conclusion(?) in the third. Also one of the
only books I know that has a character using ze/hir pronouns, but it also
unhelpfully talks about sex as different from and perhaps less malleable
than gender, so I wouldn't call this a "dope representation of trans
folks," so much as "well there's some genderqueerness I guess".

**Adventure Zone: There Be Gerblins**

A masterful adaptation of the podcast D&D romp into a graphic novel. I
absolutely loved this. I'm not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn't
listened to the podcast, but if you haven't, get on it... it's free and
it's delightful.

**La Bastarda** — Trifonia Melibea Obono [*](#les)

A lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman
abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself
falling for another woman. The first half was full of build-up and
world-building, but the back half felt like a very rushed piece, as though
Trifonia was hoping to get it all out in a final effort. I enjoyed this
book, but the bits that were glossed over about Okomo's journeys, her
grandfather's death, and other scenes could've been fleshed-out.

**Blackfish City** — Sam J. Miller [**](#ghost)

This book ruled, and I was super surprised at how much I loved it.
Absolutely riveting, and a blast. The individual characters felt very
distict, and were easy to follow, and the world felt really interesting.

**Infidel** — Kameron Hurley

Really loving this series about a tough AF bounty hunter lady named Nyx.
The world-building is pretty interesting, and the story moves forward at a
pretty good clip. All-told, this is a fun sci-fi action novel.

**Paprika** — Yasutaka Tsutsui

A fantasticly bizarre story of science, dreams, desire, and the smallness
of men. I'd seen the anime adapted from this book years ago, so I had some
predisposition towards envisioning characters a certain way, but this book
goes to way different places than I remember the movie going. I liked this
quite a bit, save for the weird shit with sexual assault. Like many books
written by a guy, it shows.

**Little Fish** — Casey Plett

Outstanding and devastating. This is a book full of people I've known, slept with, and smiled at across the room. Family is a tenuous thing, and Little Fish finds space for it throughout. I'm not sure what I would've
made with this years ago, but now, it's a sad and good ache. I hope Casey
keeps writing, and sharing her work with us for years to come. I read this
in one go, and it was a wild ride that had me laughing and crying.

**Swearing Off Stars** — Danielle Wong [*](#les)

Started off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common "I can't
really be with you until it's too late" lesbian novel. I also kept thinking
an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was
an odd read, and the time-jumps didn't help. If you can write a lesbian
romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying?
Super annoying. It was a pretty quick read at least. Read for a lesbian
book club.

**Gods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach** — Kelly Robson [**](#ghost)

A cool scifi short novel where the future is barren, but at least there's
time-travel. I wanted more world-building, and probably a couple more books
in this story, but that also means I liked this book quite a bit. The back
half of the book felt much faster than the lead-up, and much of the action
was compacted, but it was a fun adventure. This is a solid addition to the
burgeoning eco-scifi genre.

**Gold, Fame, Citris** — Claire Vaye Watkins

Interesting book about a post-apocolyptic wasteland America and the ideas
of survival and family. I enjoyed this.

**Space Opera** — Catherynne M. Valente [**](#ghost)

Uproriously fun, and silly throughout. Take Douglas Adams, add in some
queerness, and an obsession with Eurovision. Loved this from start to
finish. I devoured the backhalf of this book in one sitting at a cafe in
Copenhagen, and found myself crying in the afterword/credits.

**Caszandra** — Andrea Höst

Ugh, I wanted to enjoy the rest of this story, but this book was so
exceedingly dull. I **loathe** that the main character was setup to not
only get married, but have kids at ~19 years old. Fuck that. This series
started off well, but ended up being even worse than Twilight. Read the
first book, and skip the rest.

**Lab Rat One** — Andrea Höst

Ok, this series is exceedingly straight, and that's a bummer. I wish there
was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues
to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I've gotten slightly
sick of the cycles of "power then injury" that Cass goes through, but I'm
going to finish this out.

**Stray** — Andrea Höst

This was recommended to me by my buddy Nick, and I'd avoided it for unknown
reasons. Maybe the cover was too low-budget? But, this book is really fun.
I think this series kinda qualifies as YA, but the journal nature, as well
as the mystery of scifi tech/magic systems got me deep into the world. A
really nice vacation read.

**All Systems Red** — Martha Wells

Pretty fun book about a "murderbot" who would rather be watching tv dramas
than shooting anything. I'm looking forward to the next few books.

**Things to Do When You're Goth in the Country** — Chavisa Woods [**](#ghost)

A truly excellent short-story collection that pairs well with some of the
stories in Her Body and Other Stories. This book reminded me of growing up
southern baptist in Texas, after September 11th. Really beautiflly written,
and quite melancholy.

**A Wrinkle in Time** — Madeline L'lengle[**](#ghost)

This was a re-read, but I loved diving through it again.

**The End of My Career** — Martha Grover

Hilarious, sad, and real; the End of My Career is a very intimate look at
life in Portland as a chronically ill woman with history and a sense of
humor. I loved this. I wish it were gayer, but I wish everything were gayer,
so. As a more recent Portlander, the pain, and amusement she talks about
watching her city change is similar to how I felt about my home of Austin.

**Soulless** — Gail Corrigan [**](#ghost)

Wow, I hated this. I started reading it with a wry grin, but couldn't ever
decide if it meant to be as insipid as it was. I never want to read about
how hot a wereman is again. I never want to read about umbrellas, or
petticoats.

**Acceptance** — Jeff Vandermeer

The final book in the Southern Reach trilogy ties everything together, and
provides a lot of backstory and history. There's so much that's desperately
sad in this book, and I love it.

**Authority** — Jeff Vandermeer

I loved this second book both times I read it, because so much of it is a
slow creep of bueracracy and questions. Why isn't anyone giving Control a
straight answer? What's with Ghost Bird? Ugh, this series is fantastic.

**Annihilation** — Jeff Vandermeer

This is a re-read, because right after seeing the movie based on this book,
I wanted to dive back into Area X. To me, this series still captures all
the best parts of Vandermeer's wierdness in a cohesive way. If Borne was
oddly funny, this book is just odd, and City of Saints & Madmen is,
perhaps, homicidal. I'm still not sure if there are many hidden things in
this book, but I also haven't looked too deep, bc City of Saints & Madmen
sucked me in in a way I found frightenting.

**Goodbye, Things** — Fumio Sasaki

What an odd book full of short, declarative sentences. Some bits of this
were great, but a lot of it was about what you'd expect from a Medium
article. The bit about the owl statues was golden.

**The Language of Power** — Rosemary Kirstein

A great fourth book in a series I've really loved. This book furthers the
"what the fuck are the wizards, and what're they doing" plotline. A lot of
suspicions from the past few books have led me here. There's some really
neat stuff left to figure out, so I hope that in a few years we'll have
book 5 & 6.

**Girls on Fire** — Robin Wasserman

Fantastic coming-of-age book. I really loved all the grunge, and
surrepitious drinking, and peer-pressure.

**Binti: Night Masquerade** — Nnedi Okafor

The trilogy comes to an ok conclusion. This wasn't my favorite Binti (the
first one has that handily covered). Additionally, the pacing was wacky.
There was a _lot_ of time spent building up to a conflict that doesn't go
very far, then an unsatisfying conclusion. The main character ends up
having so much thrown at her with little-to-no consequence, that the whole
thing gets to a comic level of ridiculousness.

**Null States** — Malka Older

A nice sequel to Infomocracy that explored some new characters while still
letting Mishma and Ken run around a bit. Much of this book was a build-up
that never seemed to deliver, but it feels like the story will come to a
head a bit more in the potential next book.

**Infomocracy** — Malka Older

This techno political thriller ruled. This story created the kind of world
I want to dig around in for some time to come, so I'm glad there's at least
one more.

**Autonomous** — Annalee Newitz [**](#ghost)

Drug piracy, copyright, and queerness. I really loved this story, save for
the happy ending for the cops.

**On Such a Full Sea** — Chang-Rae Lee

Really enjoyed this futuristic look at America and the fall of our current
system. Lots of discussion of class, immigration, and identity. The
narrator was a little distracting, but it was an interesting narrative
conceit.

**Slice Harvester** — Colin Atrophy Hagendorf

**The Inheritance Trilogy** — NK Jemison

**The Remedy** — Zena Sherman

**Texts from Jane Eyre** — Mallory Ortberg

I didn't understand half of this, because Mallory & I have divergent
tastes, but she gave me a European paperback, so I read it finally after it
being sold out in a bunch of places. Love her.

**Freedom is a Constant Struggle** — Angela Davis [**](#ghost)

This was a coven book club book. It was lovely, but also super repetitive,
because most of the talks/essays were written/given around the same time,
so the themes & topics are the same. Important, but I probably didn't need
to read them all.

**Motor Crush Vol.1** — Babs Tarr

I'm really stoked on this queer lady motorcycle racing comic. Like, damn. I
can't wait for the next one. The art is fantastic, and the story is a
little light, but hints at a lot more. The world seems interesting. Why do
the motorcycles get addicted?

**The Idiot** — Elif Batuman

**My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness** — Kabi Nagata

**Hard Boiled & Hard Luck** — Banana Yoshimoto

A nice slice-of life, that's sad in a way that is very refreshing in the
summer. These books are about losses, and how to cope and move forward.
I'm really enjoying rediscovering Banana Yoshimoto's writing.

**Bittersweet** — Nevada Barr [*](#les)

An easy-enough read, but the story was too "femme danger & butch power" for
me. The "love" story takes place between a late-20s/early-30s woman and a
teenager (gross), and at a certain point they basically agree that if a man
tries to marry Sarah, she'll just go along — bc obviously femme women are
just waiting for a man, and butches have to fight those men off bc we have
no agency. I dunno. This author is also, AFAIK straight... which is doubly
strange. Weird shit happens in this, and maybe it's worth reading if you're
super into the 19th century "west," but the adult on teen predatory love
and the bullshit masc > femme stuff is really not my bag.

**Zodiac Starforce: By the Power of Astra** — Kevin Panetta

Cute sailor-moon-style girl team of fighters. Really enjoyed how this was
drawn, and the queerness of a few of the characters. If you need something
lighthearted, it's worth a read.

**Generation Loss** — Elizabeth Hand

I'd only read Fire, a short story collection by Hand, before and wasn't
sure what to expect. It was exciting expecting this to be odd literary
fiction, then discovering it's a moody mystery. Definitely fun, and odd,
and great.

**Witches, Sluts, Feminists** — Kristen J. Sollee [**](#ghost)

This was a decent non-fiction exploration of witches & to a degree, sluts &
feminists through the ages. It focuses primarily on the Americas, and
despite my usual disinterest in non-fiction this was fun and informative
enough to carry me through on a camping trip during the eclipse. Time to
find some DMT for my flying broom.

**God's War** — Kameron Hurley [**](#ghosts)

Queer bounty hunters, devout magicians, and so much sand intermingled in
this fun ride through a Islam-based religion colonized planet where organs
are bought and sold, and a war between two countries rages on pointlessly.
I wanted to stay in this world for longer, as new wrinkles kept being
added. Luckily, there's a sequel.

**The Stone Sky** — NK Jemison

Wow, this was a fantastic ending to a delightful trilogy. Loved this story
of family, world-rending powers, and ecology. Seriously one of the best
things I've read in years, in fantasy or literature.

**The Merry Spinster** — Mallory Ortberg

[Review on Medium](https://medium.com/@brookshelley/a-review-of-the-merry-spinster-15f41072834c)

**Notes from a Crocodile** — Qiu Miaojin [**](#ghost)

This book was such a lovely combination of melancholy feelings, and
slightly obsessive lesbian love. I loved all of the Abe references.

**Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe** — Fannie Flagg [*](#les)

This was very much like a long conversation with an old woman in the south,
like say, a grandma. I had a great time reading this, but there was a long,
slow burn until I was crying, from my intitial "meh, this is ok."

**Paper Girls: Vol. 3** — Brian K Vaughn

I still have no idea where this is going, but so far it's still a fun ride.

**Bitch Planet: Vol. 2** — Kelly Sue DeConnick

Trans women were paid to consult on this volume, and it shows. I'm super
curious to see where the women on thr prison planet wind up. The art in
this isn't my favorite, but it seems well-written at least.

**Ink & Bone** — Rachel Caine

This is the first in a series I'll probably read the rest of. It was a cute
and occasionally brutal story about the flow of information, and what might
have occurred if the library of Alexandria had become a world-controlling
organization. There's a YA/Harry Potter vibe to the whole thing.

**Ash** — Malinda Lo [*](#les)

Retelling and retooling the Cinderalla tale into a lesbian romance, Ash is
a pretty fun read. I blazed through this quickly, and am curious to read
more from Lo. Compared to most books we read for Lesbian Book Club, this
was a very light, but we-written book, and that's a nice respite. I'm
always here for books where the protagonist falls in love with a huntress.

**The Witch's Daughter** — Paula Brackston [***](#scifi)

A fun tale told in the present and past of a witch on the run, and her new
apprentice. This book drew me in and kept me awake late so I could find out
what happened next. I'm excited to read the second one. A definite
improvement over the first book for this club, which I quit part-way
through.

**The Witches of New York** — Ami McKay [**](#ghost)

This book was great. I read a lot of witch books this month, but this was
by far my favorite. It captured the New York or yore well, and delightfully
set up for a few more stories about these women and their tea and sympathy
shop. The magic in this book was better fleshed-out than The Witch's
Daughter, and I enjoyed the church being the enemy, though demons vs.
witches was an odd choice.

**The Little Book of Hygge** — Meik Wiking

Broke my rule about reading white guys to read this random book about
Hygge. TBH I thought the author was a woman for most of the book. Oh well.
This is a book all about candles, coziness, and of course, hygge. Turn the
lights down low, light some tallow, and drink some gløgg this winter to
make even a Copenhagen/Portland winter happy. I was happy to find that I'm
already living a hella hygge life, but got some further tips on hyggeligt.

**Rose of No Man's Land** — Michelle Tea

This is a lesser-known Tea book, but also one of her few true fiction
books. This was kinda cute, and definitely an intense slice of life of a
young _maybe_ lesbian near Boston, complete with mall life, and scoring
drugs and alcohol. It's a short book, but I really liked it.

**Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit** — Jeaneatte Winterson

This was a re-read, but dang. I'm excited to read the more real-life
version of her story _Why Be Happy When You Can Be Normal_ soon. Growing up
in a religious home, albeit a fortunately less zealous one as a queer woman
this book meant a lot.

**Her Body and Other Parties** — Carmen Maria Machado

Wow. This short-story collection knocked me back with the depth and power
of its often odd stories. The midsection of the book satirically and
diabolically explores a popular network crime drama, and reading it I
immediately went from "what the hell?" to "omg I love this". I am thrumming
with anticipation of more work from Machado. This is probably the best
thing I've read this year.

**Are You My Mother?** — Alison Bechdel

A messy tangle of a book and metabook about a mother and therapy. I liked
this, but it's coming from such a strange distant place I wasn't able to
immediately connect to it in the way I did with Fun Home. I'm going to keep
thinking about this one.

**Basic Witches** — Jaya Saxena & Jess Zimmerman [**](#ghost)

A series of spells, and a lot of nice discussion of how to care for oneself
with witchcraft, presence of mind, and good friends. I liked this a lot,
but it was fairly, well, basic. This would be a great introduction to give
to a younger person.

**Caraval** — Stephanie Garber

Some light-hearted YA to close out the year. This was a well-told, if
sometimes upsetting story. A lot of this had me wondering: straight people,
are you ok?
