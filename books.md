1. **Reaquainted with Life** – Kokumo

2. **The Kingdom of Gods** – NK Jemison

3. **Slice Harvester** – Colin Atrophy Hagendorf

4. **The Inheritance Trilogy** – NK Jemison

5. **The Remedy** – Zena Sherman

6. **Texts from Jane Eyre** – Mallory Ortberg

    I didn't understand half of this, because Mallory & I have divergent
    tastes, but she gave me a European paperback, so I read it finally after it
    being sold out in a bunch of places. Love her.

7. **Freedom is a Constant Struggle** – Angela Davis [**](#ghost)

    This was a coven book club book. It was lovely, but also super repetitive,
    because most of the talks/essays were written/given around the same time,
    so the themes & topics are the same. Important, but I probably didn't need
    to read them all.

8. **The Small Backs of Children** – Lydia Yuknavitch

9. **Objects in Mirror are Closer...** – Kate Carroll deGates [*](#les)

20. **For Your Own Good** – Leah Horlick

21. **Difficult Women** – Roxanne Gay

22. **Exit West** – Moisin Hamid [**](#ghost)

    Another book club book. This was a really neat exploration of immigration,
    family, and place. I super loved this book.

23. **Sex Object** – Jessica Valenti

24. **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** – Becky Chambers [**](#ghost)

43. **Monstress Vol.2: The Blood** – Marjorie Liu

44. **Murcielago Vol.2** – Yoshinarakana

45. **Motor Crush Vol.1** – Babs Tarr

    I'm really stoked on this queer lady motorcycle racing comic. Like, damn. I
    can't wait for the next one. The art is fantastic, and the story is a
    little light, but hints at a lot more. The world seems interesting. Why do
    the motorcyles get addicted?

46. **The Idiot** – Elif Batuman

47. **My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness** – Kabi Nagata

48. **Hard Boiled & Hard Luck** – Banana Yoshimoto

    A nice slice-of life, that's sad in a way that is very refreshing in the
    summmer. These books are about losses, and how to cope and move forward.
    I'm really enjoying rediscovering Banana Yoshimoto's writing.

49. **Bittersweet** – Nevada Barr [*](#les)

    An easy-enough read, but the story was too "femme danger & butch power" for
    me. The "love" story takes place between a late-20s/early-30s woman and a
    teenager (gross), and at a certain point they basically agree that if a man
    tries to marry Sarah, she'll just go along – bc obviously femme women are
    just waiting for a man, and butches have to fight those men off bc we have
    no agency. I dunno. This author is also, AFAIK straight... which is doubly
    strange. Weird shit happens in this, and maybe it's worth reading if you're
    super into the 19th century "west," but the adult on teen predatory love
    and the bullshit masc > femme stuff is really not my bag.

50. **Zodiac Starforce: By the Power of Astra** – Kevin Panetta

    Cute sailor-moon-style girl team of fighters. Really enjoyed how this was
    drawn, and the queerness of a few of the characters. If you need something
    lighthearted, it's worth a read.

51. **Generation Loss** – Elizabeth Hand

    I'd only read Fire, a short story collection by Hand, before and wasn't
    sure what to expect. It was exciting expecting this to be odd literary
    fiction, then discovering it's a moody mystery. Definitely fun, and odd,
    and great.

52. **Witches, Sluts, Feminists** – Kristen J. Sollee [**](#ghost)

    This was a decent non-fiction exploration of witches & to a degree, sluts &
    feminists through the ages. It focuses primarily on the Americas, and
    despite my usual disinterest in non-fiction this was fun and informative
    enough to carry me through on a camping trip during the eclipse. Time to
    find some DMT for my flying broom.

53. **God's War** – Kameron Hurley

    Queer bounty hunters, devout magicians, and so much sand intermingled in
    this fun ride through a Islam-based religion colonized planet where organs
    are bought and sold, and a war between two countries rages on pointlessly.
    I wanted to stay in this world for longer, as new wrinkles kept being
    added. Luckily, there's a sequel.

54. **The Stone Sky** – NK Jemison

    Wow, this was a fantastic ending to a delightful trilogy. Loved this story
    of family, world-rending powers, and ecology. Seriously one of the best
    things I've read in years, in fantasy or literature.

55. **The Merry Spinster** – Mallory Ortberg

    *Review forthcoming when this book actually comes out.*

56. **Notes from a Crocodile** – Qiu Miaojin [**](#ghost)

    This book was such a lovely combination of melanchholy feelings, and
    slightly obsessive lesbian love. I loved all of the Abe references.

57. **Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe** – Fannie Flagg [*](#les)

    This was very much like a long conversation with an old woman in the south,
    like say, a grandma. I had a great time reading this, but there was a long,
    slow burn until I was crying, from my intitial "meh, this is ok."

58. **Paper Girls: Vol. 3** – Brian K Vaughn

    I still have no idea where this is going, but so far it's still a fun ride.

59. **Bitch Planet: Vol. 2** – Kelly Sue DeConnick

    Trans women were paid to consult on this volume, and it shows. I'm super
    curious to see where the women on thr prison planet wind up. The art in
    this isn't my favorite, but it seems well-written at least.

60. **Ink & Bone** – Rachel Caine

    This is the first in a series I'll probably read the rest of. It was a cute
    and occasionally brutal story about the flow of information, and what might
    have occurred if the library of Alexandria had become a world-controlling
    organization. There's a YA/Harry Potter vibe to the whole thing.

61. **Ash** – Malinda Lo [*](#les)

    Retelling and retooling the Cinderalla tale into a lesbian romance, Ash is
    a pretty fun read. I blazed through this quickly, and am curious to read
    more from Lo. Compared to most books we read for Lesbian Book Club, this
    was a very light, but we-written book, and that's a nice respite. I'm
    always here for books where the protagonist falls in love with a huntress.

62. **The Witch's Daughter** – Paula Brackston [***](#scifi)

    A fun tale told in the present and past of a witch on the run, and her new
    apprentice. This book drew me in and kept me awake late so I could find out
    what happened next. I'm excited to read the second one. A definite
    improvement over the first book for this club, which I quit part-way
    through.

63. **The Witches of New York** – Ami McKay [**](#ghost)

    This book was great. I read a lot of witch books this month, but this was
    by far my favorite. It captured the New York or yore well, and delightfully
    set up for a few more stories about these women and their tea and sympathy
    shop. The magic in this book was better fleshed-out than The Witch's
    Daughter, and I enjoyed the church being the enemy, though demons vs.
    wtiches was an odd choice.

64. **The Little Book of Hygge** – Meik Wiking

    Broke my rule about reading white guys to read this random book about
    Hygge. TBH I thought the author was a woman for most of the book. Oh well.
    This is a book all about candles, coziness, and of course, hygge. Turn the
    lights down low, light some tallow, and drink some gløgg this winter to
    make even a Copenhagen/Portland winter happy. I was happy to find that I'm
    already living a hella hygge life, but got some further tips on hyggeligt.

65. **Rose of No Man's Land** – Michelle TEARS

    This is a lesser-known Tea book, but also one of her few true fiction
    books. This was kinda cute, and definitely an intense slice of life of a
    young _maybe_ lesbian near Boston, complete with mall life, and scoring
    drugs and alcohol. It's a short book, but I really liked it.
