Another weekend is upon us! Blessed weekend! It’s August, can you believe it?! I read some old journal entries today from the before times and it’s funny to see how much my life and activities were the same as they are now. When this pandemic is wrapped-up, I know I’ll appreciate a quick visit to a wine bar much more, at least for a few weeks. This week also marked the end of my second month of 3x a week workout classes, which I think is making a difference in my energy and emotional health.</description></item><item><title>July</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-08-01-july/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-08-01-july/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s midsummer here in Oakland, and due to the persistence of people’s risky behavior, we’re still very quarantined. At this rate, I might read quite a few more books than I initially imagined I would, as it could be well rinto 2021 before anything changes. I’m still watching quite a bit of TV, and the Formula 1 season that finally started. Seeing folks drive cars all over Europe is quite the treat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dill &amp; Fennel 30</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/dill-fennel-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 07:25:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/dill-fennel-30/</guid><description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 30
This weekend was pretty nice in the Shelley house—we started early by taking Friday off to volunteer for the Women’s Foundation (Snorri mostly yelled), and spent the rest of our time laying around (Snorri), and playing Good Sudoku. I’ve also thought about getting back into shooting photos and biking around, which could be a fun adventure. In preparation, I even picked-up a new camera, so expect better pictures of my cat and neighborhood soon.</description></item><item><title>Fennel &amp; Dill 29</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/fennel-dill-29/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 08:27:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/fennel-dill-29/</guid><description>Happy March 141st! Time continues to show up for me in the cycles of life—laundry, therapy, medicine, and plant watering. With news that most schools will open virtually in the fall, I get the sense that “summer” for kids will continue well into 2021, albeit without pool parties. It’s a weird, life-defining time. Snorri and I are weathering things well, and possibly even thriving. As my friend Lena said yesterday, “I’m an indoor cat”.</description></item><item><title>Microposting</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/microposting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 08:01:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/microposting/</guid><description>After a few days of playing around with micropub and the indieweb (which seems to largely be from 2018 and 2019) I have a micropub server that works with Hugo and integrates with iAWriter. Hooray!
With the beta of iOS 14 I’ve had to heavily modify my publishing shortcuts, and while they’re pretty great, publishing directly through Micropub with the “publish” button in iAWriter seems even more convenient.
If you’re using Hugo or Jekyll, this is a good starting place, and only needs minor tweaks to exposed config values to work with most setups of either static backend.</description></item><item><title>Fennel &amp; Dill 28</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-07-12-fennel-dill-28/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-07-12-fennel-dill-28/</guid><description>Another week, and another Formula One race in Austria. For the first time in the over 70 year history of this race series two races occurred at the same track. The first race included loads of suspension and tire issues due to curbs, and this weekend included with a veritable lake on the track. If you’ve never watched car racing, I recommend Netflix’s excellent behind-the-scenes series. Outside of high speed racing, my week was a bit of a let-down, as I found out I didn’t get a position at work I’d interviewed for on Wednesday.</description></item><item><title>Fennel &amp; Dill 27</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-07-05-fennel-dill-27/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-07-05-fennel-dill-27/</guid><description>Well, the long weekend and constant fireworks in Oakland threw me for a loop!

My body was thankful for the heat respite, and Snorri was cuddlier as a result. This week felt long, after having Juneteenth off last week, but next Friday we observe Independence Day, so it’s another short week. I can’t say I’m looking forward to the even more ubiquitous fireworks, but hopefully the cops will finally run out.
I spent a lot of time watching tv this week, and enjoying good Japanese Whiskey.</description></item><item><title>WWDC Thoughts</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-22-wwdc-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-22-wwdc-thoughts/</guid><description>Like most of the folks who marginally to maximally care about Apple stuff, I watched WWDC today from my house on my TV. Our work chat was going wild throughout, especially during the bits about the ARM transition over the next few years.

Yesterday, my company gave Juneteenth off as time to volunteer and remember, and I spent most of the day with the Women’s Foundation of Oregon discussing budgets and our COVID relief fund. As a Texan, I grew up hearing about Juneteenth, but still hadn’t fully understood Texas as “part of the south” until a few years ago, since Austin had firmly insulated itself from owning our history.</description></item><item><title>Fennel &amp; Dill 24</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-14-fennel-dill-24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-14-fennel-dill-24/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s been a rough week for so many folks I love due to police violence and a Friday rollback of national trans healthcare. I hope you’re taking care of yourself, and your loved ones. Reach out, and stick together, even if we’re far away from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll keep sending out these link emails every week though, as I think it’s important to read and see things that can surprise, delight, or teach us even as we mourn and fight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stoked on Survivor</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-12-stoked-on-survivor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-12-stoked-on-survivor/</guid><description>After twenty years of this CBS reality show being on TV, I finally jumped on board as a fan. A few years ago, a podcast I enjoy discussed a John Siricusa’s longstanding love of Survivor, and even offered a list of his favorite seasons. I dipped a toe in with one season, then promptly decided that was enough, until March brought a shelter at home.

COVID is still scary, but it’s been an even harder week due to police violence against black Americans, murdering multiple people and assaulting countless more. Fuck the cops. Fuck the violent, racist state.
With that said, I will go ahead and share some links, as usual, with a few that may help you grapple with what’s happening right now.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in baking</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-01-adventures-in-baking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-01-adventures-in-baking/</guid><description>Before March I rarely baked. Outside of a few misadventures as a kid, I’d mostly made hand pies, and a few loaves of pulla, but bread was mostly beyond me. Just like the yeast that seeded Carl, my starter, sourdough making was in the air. My favorite sourdough baker Acme’s loaves became hard to get from Berkeley Bowl a few weeks into the quarantine, so I decided to follow along with everyone else, and get way too into bread making.</description></item><item><title>Fennel &amp; Dill 22</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-07-fennel-dill-week-22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-07-fennel-dill-week-22/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy week! At my company, we had Monday and Friday off, and most of our staff took off the entire week. I decided to work through the week for some reason, and ended-up getting a lot done!

I’ve lost lots of data in the past, and ultimately it’s just much easier to keep text portable and backed-up when it’s a .txt or .md
In the ensuing years, I’ve written a few blog posts, and listed tons of books and movies but I hadn’t done much with my site’s structure or design besides moving my static site generator from Jekyll to Hugo on a whim last year.</description></item><item><title>Fennel &amp; Dill 21</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-07-fennel-dill-week-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-07-fennel-dill-week-21/</guid><description>Welp, first sunburn of the quarantine for this gal. I spent the afternoon in a friend’s yard (hi André and Haley) and forgot my skin has been softened by indoor lighting for months. On the upside, it was gorgeous outside, and I’m glad I got to sit in the sun.

Taken up amateur plumbing? I went out last weekend for the first time, albeit just down the street to sit in a friend’s yard, far from said friend.

We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer.

Specifically, toilet paper hoarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to venture out this week to the grocery, but the TP situation in my house is on its way to dire. I was able to procure napkins a week ago, so&amp;hellip; needs must.
The only hoarding I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do, back when it was just called &amp;ldquo;collecting&amp;rdquo; was of alcohol. I&amp;rsquo;m a little proud of my strange Shochu collection, largely enabled by my friends over at Umami Mart (who&amp;rsquo;re still doing curbside pickup in the East Bay, btw).</description></item><item><title>March</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-31-march/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-31-march/</guid><description>Books Empress of Forever — Max Gladstone

Off to Kyoto Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience.</description></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 1</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/</guid><description>Wow, things sure are quiet&amp;hellip;
Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor.
Unfortunately, in the following weeks COVID-19 grew at a wild rate, the cases in the United States were clearly skyrocketing despite a complete failure of the CDC and leadership to provide ample testing.</description></item><item><title>links week eleven</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-15-links-week-eleven/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-15-links-week-eleven/</guid><description>Welcome to a new world without toilet paper.

I learned it’s a lot cheaper than I thought it would be—in Portland it cost 60 bucks a session.

This week marked the inaugural Figma conference, which I was able to attend through my employer. It was neat to be surrounded by designers from all over the world, and think about how to solve bigger problems than just “how to make people click”.
I also got to meet up with Craig Mod of hiking, ebook, and Leica writing renound—he’s a delight.

An alright mystery book, but more than a few times, I think the author attempted to add grit but just ended up sounding like a very awkward narrator.</description></item><item><title>A Weekly Link Newsletter</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-07-21-newsletter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-07-21-newsletter/</guid><description>It’s official: I’ve joined the newsletter trend in earnest. I’ve had a newsletter for a few months now, but I wasn’t sure what to really do with it.

More cool space stuff! I enjoyed the pacing more in this book, and despite the frustration with very 50s attitudes that still pervade the modern world, I enjoyed journeying with these two books to mars.
The Bone Clocks — David Mitchell
A delightful collision of strange characters across time. This book is just fantastical enough to scratch my sci-fi itch, and literary enough to keep me satisfied.</description></item><item><title>iPadOS</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-09-ios13/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-09-ios13/</guid><description>It’s probably clear by now that I love my iPad Pro.

Books Noumenon — Marina J. Lostetter

An alternate history where Japan and Germany won WW2, then proceeded to divvy up North America. Most of the book is set in the 80s, in a world of internet devices, and giant robots, ruled by the Japanese emperor. It&amp;rsquo;s a brutal story at times, but was generally interesting and a good sci-fi time.

My wardrobe generally cycles between a few pieces, so it wasn’t much of a stretch to adapt it to a month in Japan or Berlin. I usually write a post-trip gear update, but today is all about clothing.

A fantastic book about humankind settling on a tidally-locked planet, but instead of seeing how we cope, we learn the stories of their descendants, hundreds of years after our first tentative steps. The light is too bright and hot, and the night too cold and dark. We live on the edge in an eternal dusk/morning light. The two protagonists, Mouth, and Sophie, are on the edges of society, yearning for things they&amp;rsquo;ve lost or can&amp;rsquo;t have, and all that leads towards.</description></item><item><title>Travel kit update</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-13-travel-kit-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-13-travel-kit-update/</guid><description>Since 2019, I updated my kit a little bit, but mostly it stayed the same.
One old bag, one new My Ryu Quickpack was a delight once-again, as I used it to transport all my gear to Japan, and then from city to city. Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I&amp;rsquo;ve owned, but due to its size, I don&amp;rsquo;t like hauling it around all day.</description></item><item><title>February</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Genocidal Organ — Project Itoh
A truly grim thriller about the cost of “fighting terrorism,” and the ability of language to tear apart a country. This feels eerily prescient. I can’t say I enjoyed reading this book, but it’s a nihilistic political commentary that at least adds some color to what politicians might be after when they start wars and conflicts.

I was in middle school at the time, and decided to learn how to read Japanese so I could read literature and comics. The class was fun, and also super weird, since I was the only kid there.

Time to watch even more shows and movies, and with the rise of bingeable 10 hour TV movies, I have found myself watching fewer of the 90-120 minute variety. With Criteron launching a movie service, maybe that’ll change.

It’s been a year and change since I posted about my iPhone apps and homescreen. I tend to try out new apps pretty often, but now that I use an iPad and an Apple Watch every day, I generally stick with things that support all 3 of my screens well. Some apps have stuck around, but many have been replaced by better (for me) choices. Trying to settle into apps that I use for a long stretch is challenging as businesses fail, or apps stagnate, so here we are.</description></item><item><title>Moving to the bay</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-21-moving-to-the-bay/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-21-moving-to-the-bay/</guid><description>Queers and Steers As a Texan, and a lesbian, I knew eventually I’d end up in California. That’s what we do. We leave Texas, and go west. I’ve spent the past four years hundreds of miles north in Portland, OR working remotely for various companies. I loved the trees, and the few amazing friends I made there, but found it hard to get through the long, lonely winters.

This book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Odyssey, this is a must read.
Red Clocks &amp;ndash; Leni Zumas

Wow, I loved this book. A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It&amp;rsquo;s also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Invasions</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-14-invasions-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-14-invasions-review/</guid><description>It begins with a rip, the tearing sound of velcro—mix and match nipples kick off this delightfully strange collection of speculative fiction, trans body-horror, and water-logged zombies.

A fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn&amp;rsquo;t love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.</description></item><item><title>Post XOXO thoughts</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-09-10-xoxo-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-09-10-xoxo-thoughts/</guid><description>In my previous post, I talked about anticipating XOXO 2018, which ended last night.

In an odd turn of fate, I&amp;rsquo;d seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean director Park Chan-Wook.

I&amp;rsquo;d lived in Austin for most of my life, and as I quickly learned once moving, making friends in Portland is a long process. So, on a whim, I started seeing movies by myself. I went to dinner alone with a book. I even saw concerts&amp;hellip; solo, and it was fun.

I have definitely enjoyed how Matt seems to be posting cool things there instead of Twitter, because it gives me more things to see on RSS.</description></item><item><title>July</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-07-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-07-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Adventure Zone: There Be Gerblins
A masterful adaptation of the podcast D&amp;amp;D romp into a graphic novel. I absolutely loved this. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t listened to the podcast, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, get on it&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s free and it&amp;rsquo;s delightful.
La Bastarda — Trifonia Melibea Obono *
A lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself falling for another woman.</description></item><item><title>June</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-06-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-06-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Swearing Off Stars — Danielle Wong
Started off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t really be with you until it&amp;rsquo;s too late&amp;rdquo; lesbian novel. I also kept thinking an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was an odd read, and the time-jumps didn&amp;rsquo;t help. If you can write a lesbian romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying?</description></item><item><title>May</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-05-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-05-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Lab Rat One — Andrea Höst
Ok, this series is exceedingly straight, and that&amp;rsquo;s a bummer. I wish there was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten slightly sick of the cycles of &amp;ldquo;power then injury&amp;rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to finish this out.

Well, bags and shoes. Traveling as much as I do, having a dependable, comfortable, and sleek bag is pretty important. For the past two or so years, I&amp;rsquo;ve depended on my Topo Designs Trip Pack for short trips, and then nested it inside of my Ryu QuickPack for longer trips abroad. This has worked out well, but walking around Copenhagen, and going through a variety of international airport security, I wondered if I could consolidate to one bag, with an easier way to access my laptop and other stuff.</description></item><item><title>April</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-04-17-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-04-17-media-diet/</guid><description>Books All Systems Red — Martha Wells
Pretty fun book about a &amp;ldquo;murderbot&amp;rdquo; who would rather be watching tv dramas than shooting anything. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next few books.
Stray — Andrea Höst
This was recommended to me by my buddy Nick, and I&amp;rsquo;d avoided it for unknown reasons. Maybe the cover was too low-budget? But, this book is really fun. I think this series kinda qualifies as YA, but the journal nature, as well as the mystery of scifi tech/magic systems got me deep into the world.</description></item><item><title>A review of the Merry Spinster</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-03-13-merry-spinster-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-03-13-merry-spinster-review/</guid><description>“Daughters are as good a thing as any…” begins The Merry Spinster by Danny Ortberg’s wild reimagining of the Little Mermaid that ends in such grim fashion as to make the reader nod solemnly and intone, “truly, these are the end of times.” And yet, what a romp of a dark timeline. Unlike Texts from Jane Eyre, his first book of imagined text conversations from literary characters, this reader at least felt prepared for these fables, stories, and tall-tales through study of European folklore.</description></item><item><title>Sister spit</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2016-04-16-sister-spit-piece-pre-cunt-up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2016-04-16-sister-spit-piece-pre-cunt-up/</guid><description>Note: This was a cunt-up piece, so it was delivered in chunks, read out of a hat, interspersed with Cooper Lee Bombardier’s piece about the same time period/culture.

The Past Years ago, I stopped checking bags when I flew. I’d seen too many things get lost over the years, my own and other’s, and couldn’t stomach the thought of landing somewhere again, only to lose all my possessions. So, I began using a canvas duffel bag, as well as a small backpack.
The bag is grey, and around 30L in volume, has little toggle closures, and a couple internal pockets.</description></item><item><title>My year-end review of 2015</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-12-19-my-year-end-review-of-2015/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-12-19-my-year-end-review-of-2015/</guid><description>Marginally better! 2015: it sounds like we’re really moving

Growing up in Texas, I got the idea from my dad that NYC was some kind of devil city. He regarded it as a liberal place with people who walked too fast, and were too greedy. The first time I visited in my mid-twenties, I realized just how wrong he was.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on GHC</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-10-19-thoughts-on-ghc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-10-19-thoughts-on-ghc/</guid><description>Arrival
“This conference is GIGANTIC!” was my first thought upon arriving at Grace Hopper. This year’s attendance was around 10,000 folks, mostly women, and the largest conference besides SXSW that I’ve attended. Like many tech conferences, GHC had an invaluable app that showed a stream of comments from attendees as well as a schedule and other information. Once I signed in, I spent a lot of time networking and finding folks from out of town as my chosen track “Open-Source” was largely bereft of personally relevant content.</description></item><item><title>LWT NYC Summit</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-10-05-lesbians-who-tech-nyc-summit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-10-05-lesbians-who-tech-nyc-summit/</guid><description>Due to stress, the talk I am about to give usually overshadows the talks before mine. Fortunately, LWT was such a jam-packed speaker event that I was able to tune into the talks and not get eaten by nerves. There were a neat mix of 5 minute ignite talks about things like tackling systemic oppression, government tech work, and imposter syndrome. Some of these talks were similar to others I’ve heard, and the audience was so different than what I usually experience at a conference that I was a little sad we didn’t get past some of the 101 talks.</description></item><item><title>XOXO 2015</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-09-14-xoxo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-09-14-xoxo/</guid><description>XOXO Fest recap
This is my first XOXO, and as with many festivals or conferences where I know I might be overwhelmed, I was a little apprehensive. It helped so much that we had Slack setup for XOXO months in advance.

It first hit me the night she left. The quiet. Before, there was rustling in the house, subtle signs of her presence, affection in the same space. Now, the night was too quiet, her form did not move with breath next to me. I was alone. My cats tried to fill the void. The wandered, and meowed, and looked for her in closets and cabinets — or so it seemed to me, as I projected my sadness onto them.</description></item><item><title>The Allure of the minimal</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2013-04-26-the-allure-of-the-minimal-and-disconnected/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2013-04-26-the-allure-of-the-minimal-and-disconnected/</guid><description>The Future Most films that show our future are full of glitz and glamour, a fantastical land of flying vehicles. People live in clean, modern homes, and have their lives radically improved through technology, and want for nothing. Families and workers seamlessly keep in touch, and share parts of their lives with their friends and companions, and generally embrace the technology all around them.
If there is any enemy or ill feeling in the protagonist, it is usually an overlord or corporation that is taking over or slowly consuming their society.</description></item><item><title>about</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/about/</guid><description>brook is a noted sapphist who lives in a forest with her cat snorri. she loves travel, food, and satan.</description></item><item><title>movie archive</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/moviearchive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/moviearchive/</guid><description>years: 2016 2017 2018 2019
2019 74 Movies Ford vs. Ferrari
A blast! I love car racing so much, and this film was a gorgeous vision of a famous showdown between an incredible car company, and Ford. I grew up hearing stories about Shelby, and this film brought him to life.
Uncut Gems
This was wild! From front to back this movie was a rollercoaster of poor decision-making and the world of vigs, 3 way parlay, and Kevin Garnet.</description></item><item><title>read</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/books/</guid><description>2020: 36 books Infomacracy — Malka Older
A very good re-read. In the lead up to the election, this feels appropriate.
Buddhism for Beginners
A pretty solid introduction formatted as an extended Q&amp;amp;A that covers most ground related to how Buddhist teachings apply to our present time.

2019: 56 books Dept. of Speculation — Jenny Offill
A gorgeous and sad book that captures long relationships so well. I loved for narrator and the strange poetic style of storytelling. I read this in two sittings and was enraptured.
Dead Astronauts — Jeff Vandermeer
This book did some interesting things with time, and some deeply annoying things with text. I feel like I know what he was doing with this book largely, and support his environmental aims (a+ murderous blue fox), but it never really came together for me.</description></item><item><title>tv</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/tv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/tv/</guid><description>tv list years: 2018 2019

A delightful rewatch.
6 Underground
Continuing my tradition of watching mediocre Netflix thrillers, I think I’m almost done with the current set. Ryan Reynolds is doing his sarcastic guy thing, and there’s tons of fast cuts and action stuff. The first action scene felt exciting for a bit, but by the twelfth hat-on-a-hat and shitty rock song I was hoping for relief.</description></item><item><title>wrote</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/writing/</guid><description>Ninth Letter Trans New Wave
