Other films that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I&amp;rsquo;ve accrued over the years.</description><content:encoded><p>Out of<a href="https://letterboxd.com/brookshelley/films/">74 movies</a>, I wanted to pick a few that really stood out, and then talk briefly about a few that I really didn&rsquo;t enjoy. I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I&rsquo;ve accrued over the years.</p><p><img src="/photos/letterboxd.jpeg" alt="favorite movies photo"/><hr><h2 id="the-list">The List</h2><p>In no particular order, here are ten films that really stood out to me.</p><p><strong>‌Uncut Gems</strong></p><p>A real delight of failure and crushed dreams.</p><p><strong>Shoplifters</strong></p><p>A family of criminals gets to be perfectly human.</p><p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p><p>Nicole Kidman is a badass drunk detective.</p><p><strong>Us</strong></p><p>Under the boarrrrddddwalk. Boardwalk.</p><p><strong>Arctic</strong></p><p>Competence porn.</p><p><strong>Midsommar</strong></p><p>The best breakup film ever.</p><p><strong>The Farewell</strong></p><p>I cried quite a bit—major family feelings.</p><p><strong>First Reformed</strong></p><p>The world is getting hotter, and Ethan Hawke is too, inexplicably.</p><p><strong>Booksmart</strong></p><p>Cool buddy comedy with a talented younger cast.</p><p><strong>Parasite</strong></p><p>Eat the rich.</p><p>Honorable mention: Ford Vs. Ferrari.</p><h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2><p><strong>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker</strong></p><p>Look, I don&rsquo;t want to spoil this for anyone who cares, but has somehow not seen the film yet. I was super disappointed in how the series ended, and what a raw deal Rose got. Did we need<em>yet another droid</em>? It&rsquo;s particularly sad that with the Mandolorian really succeeding as a tv show, this is the pap we get in theaters.<a href="https://letterboxd.com/demiadejuyigbe/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/1/">Demi is better at tearing this apart than I am</a>.</p><p><strong>Predator</strong></p><p>Wow. Even as a fan of crap action films, this was a letdown.</p><p><strong>Hobbes &amp; Shaw</strong></p><p>Listen, I<em>love</em> the Fast &amp; Furious series like a warm blanket—it has cars, explosions, family, and little-to-no-complexity. Some of that was still present in this film, but they managed to hamstring the only female protagonist, and replace all the joy with ball jokes.</p><p><strong>Wandering Earth</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why I expected this to be great, but it was just hokey as hell.</p><p><strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong></p><p>I know, right? I hated the new Star Wars and the end of the Avenger&rsquo;s duology? I&rsquo;m obviously a monster. Unfortunately, this movie was much like Rise of Skywalker in that it mistook random scenes of characters folks recognize for a plot or joy. It takes more than seeing Spider-Man appear on screen for me to be excited these days—just look at the incredible Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse for tips on how to do this well. I think some plot lines do better in multiple comics, and not on the silver screen. Smaller, more fun superhero films in 2020, please.</p><h2 id="2019-streaming">2019 streaming</h2><p>Wow, 2019 was a great year for films! If you want to read longer reviews of the above films, visit my<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/movies">movies page</a>. I didn&rsquo;t set out to watch more films this year, but with Amazon Prime, Criterion, Kanopy, iTunes, and Netflix, it was super easy to watch most of the stuff I wanted to see. I finally upgraded to a 4K TV and 4K Apple TV too, so I will likely watch even more things at my house without trekking to the land of empty cola machines and questionable curly fries.</p><hr><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><p>Looking towards next year, the films I&rsquo;m currently most excited about are:</p><p><strong>A Promising Young Woman</strong></p><p>Revenge films? Yes please.</p><p><strong>New Mutants</strong></p><p>One of the coolest X-Men teams ever, in the theater.</p><p><strong>No Time to Die</strong></p><p>I honestly love James Bond films, and I can&rsquo;t pretend otherwise.</p><p><strong>Monster Hunter</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why I love Resident Evil movies so much, but the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson has moved to a new video game adaptation has me stoked.</p><p><strong>Dune</strong></p><p>The David Lynch version of Dune, in all of its weirdness, was one of the movies I watched on repeat as a child. I know, that explains a lot, right? I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the subject matter. The spice must flow!</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Favorite movies of 2018</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-31-favorite-movies-of-the-year/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-31-favorite-movies-of-the-year/</guid><description>This year started off with one of the goofiest movies I’d see all year: Murder on the Orient Express. I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:
Hunt for the Wilderpeople
This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight.</description><content:encoded><p>This year started off with one of the goofiest movies I’d see all year: Murder on the Orient Express. I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:</p><p><strong>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</strong></p><p>This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight. Family, rebellion, loss&hellip; ugh, I want to rewatch this right now.</p><p><strong>Black Panther</strong></p><p>Can you believe this came out in 2018? I got to see it in Oakland, and the crowd was dressed to the nines, and stoked AF about it. I saw Black Panther twice, and it’s the first super hero film in a while that made me smile and cheer throughout.</p><p><strong>Annihilation</strong></p><p>I loved this movie, for all that it didn’t hew to the book, and was bizarre. I’d loved the trilogy when I read it, but also enjoy Alex Garland’s films generally. I can’t say<em>why</em> I love this movie, but I do, and I saw it more than once.</p><p><strong>Sorry to Bother You</strong></p><p>I can’t say much about this indictment of capitalism and the gig-economy without spoiling it, but it’s excellent and you should go see it.</p><p><strong>Widows</strong></p><p>This movie felt like a dunk on the lackluster Oceans 8, and had everything I could want. The stakes were high, and even if it wasn’t the best at sustaining mystery, every woman in this film was outstanding.</p><p><strong>The Favourite</strong></p><p>Outstanding lesbian film. The humor in this movie was truly strange, and joyful. I feel like The Favourite came out of nowhere and blew me away, and except for a minor amount of rabbit-based fear, I was all the way here for it.</p></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
