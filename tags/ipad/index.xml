In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.</p><p>In a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.</p><h2 id="heavy">Heavy</h2><p>My first thought when I took the Magic Keyboard package out of the mailbox was, “yow, this<em>is</em> heavy.” After taking the keyboard out of its packaging, the heft remained, but once I attached my iPad to it and started typing, I forgot all about the weight. Sure, this will be a bit heavier for travel, but the modularity is worth it for me. I can’t wait to type on this while traveling, then pull the iPad off the keyboard to carry around for reading in a park, or watching a tv show. It makes me wish it were possible to pull the screen off of my work computer and walk around with it too!</p><h2 id="modular">Modular</h2><p>Ever since getting the Smart Keyboard, my iPad basically never left it. I carried my iPad around daily, fingers pressed into the keys awkwardly on the back of the screen. The previous keyboard for the iPad was also super strange in its own way, but looking back, having a primary iPad case expose you to the keyboard buttons constantly when all you want to do is read is so silly. This new Magic Keyboard makes no concessions to using it while<em>not</em> typing. The ease of removing the iPad from the keyboard (I’m almost tempted to call it a dock) is such that I don’t even think about taking my iPad with me to another room, sans keyboard. This mode-changing makes the iPad feel even more futuristic than it did before, especially because my hands are only now becoming accustomed to the thin, metallic body of the iPad, instead of the strange rubber skin of the keyboard case its lived in up until now.</p><h2 id="thunk">Thunk</h2><p>So, what’s the keyboard actually like to type on?</p><p>Fantastic.</p><p>Unlike most folks, I really enjoyed both the butterfly keyboard in my MacBook, and the cloth-covered one on the Smart Keyboard. I enjoyed the short-travel, and the weird texture, but the feel and thunk of this new keyboard is even better. I don’t really care about the backlighting, and I’m a little bit more concerned about the gaps that invite in stray drops of water, but as I mentioned above, I don’t plan to carry this with me all the time, so it’s more likely I’ll have a glass of wine sans non-waterproof keyboard, and keep drinks away when I plan to<em>type</em>.</p><p>I typed this review on the new keyboard, and the experience was absolutely fantastic. The new trackpad<em>is</em> small, but the ability to quickly laser-target my edits is a delight. No longer do I have to tap, stab, tap tap, arrow, arrow, arrow. I can just point, and click, and voila. When I’m not at work, I more or less<em>only</em> use my iPad, and this new keyboard means the typing I do will be faster, feel better, and even sound more pleasingly thunky.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-it">Should you buy it?</h2><p>Do you type on your iPad? Do you want to? Have you been tempted to plug your iPad into a monitor and use a Bluetooth trackpad? Do you love writing on the go?</p><p>If so, then this is probably the right keyboard for you. If you only occasionally reach for your iPad to watch YouTube videos, or are the kind of person who thinks traveling with an iPad<strong>and</strong> a MacBook is totally acceptable, then save your $300. In the same way that I’ve never purchased an Apple Pencil, many iPad users will never purchase this keyboard, and I think that’s totally fine. But the folks that do buy one, and get to experience the entirely wonderful experience of typing and editing will be incredibly satisfied, I think.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>iPadOS</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-09-ios13/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-09-ios13/</guid><description>It’s probably clear by now that I love my iPad Pro. I travel with it, write on it, and practice Japanese on it.</description><content:encoded><p>It’s probably clear by now that I<em>love</em> my iPad Pro. I<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/03/13/travel-kit-update.html">travel</a> with it,<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/05/02/On-Notes-and-ToDos.html">write on it</a>, and<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/01/27/learning-kanji-again.html">practice Japanese</a> on it. When Apple announced<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/">iPadOS</a>, it suddenly seemed liked my dream of only using my iPad had come true.</p><h2 id="major-updates">Major updates</h2><h3 id="new-home-screen">New home screen</h3><p>With a glance at the home screen,<img src="/photos/ipadhome.jpg" alt="photo of home screen with slide-over widgets"> it’s clear that this isn’t iOS 12. Onscreen widgets isn’t exactly revolutionary, but it saves me a slide-over every time I want to check the weather, or which meeting I’m headed to next. It’s pretty cool, and even though it’s in some ways a catch-up to what other platforms have had for a while, I dig it.</p><h3 id="copy--paste--select">Copy &amp; paste &amp; select</h3><p>Copy and pasting also get a refresh in iPadOS, with three-finger gestures copying, cutting, and pasting. I’m not sure how<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18654314/apple-ipad-os-ipados-wwdc-first-look-windows-usb-user-interface-new-features">intuitive it is</a>, but for power-users at least, it should work quite well. I’ve gotten somewhat used to the gestures already. Multiple taps allow for some cool selection specificity, though occasionally this feels more frustrating as I struggle to remember how many taps to select a word. I think this will get better with practice</p><h3 id="swipe-to-type">Swipe to type</h3><p>Ever since I started practicing kanji for an hour or two every day, I noticed I was getting repetitive strain on my thumb and hand. I’m not sure how much this new swipe-to-type will help, but I’m enjoying the faster typing it enables.</p><h3 id="desktop-safari">Desktop Safari</h3><p>This single change is the reason iPadOS is a massive update for so many of us. Desktop versions of websites mean I can finally use Google Docs, or Notion, or Figma without pulling out my MacBook Pro at work. In testing, it seems like it<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652163/google-docs-ipad-ipados-safari-apple-wwdc-2019">really works</a>, which rules. The first version of the OS just launched, so I’d expect we might see even better support between now and the launch of the OS in the fall.</p><h3 id="sign-in-with-apple">Sign-in with Apple</h3><p>This sign-in upgrade will come to iPad and iPhone, and is an amazing privacy boost for everyone using an iOS device. By removing the need to give your email address to every service I use, Apple is potentially saving me hundreds of unsubscribes and delete from inbox actions, not to mention all the scraping and ad targeting. I’m very stoked.</p><h2 id="minor-changes">Minor changes</h2><h3 id="dark-mode">Dark mode</h3><p>I love dark mode, don’t get me wrong, but this update is a small change compared to the rest of the amazing stuff packed into iPadOS.</p><h3 id="files-updates">Files updates</h3><p>Column view, quick actions, more metadata, and a downloads folder all mean better file management without a desktop. Apple also added the ability to use thumb drives and hard drives in the USB-C drive, which isn’t really something I need, but seems to be a big deal to a lot of folks.</p><h3 id="the-rest">The rest</h3><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/features/">The list goes on and on</a></p><h2 id="what-it-means-for-me">What it means for me</h2><p>With iPad OS, I can’t think of a single thing I do on my Mac that I can’t do on my iPad with the exception of working with a very large Github repo (just try downloading and updating a 6gb repo over WiFi, yow). With the addition of Catalyst apps on Mac, I hope that even more developers will devote energy to making powerful and fun iPad apps in the future. This fall will likely bring device updates with minor spec bumps, and likely this time I’ll snag a Cellular version so I can take advantage of<a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6330195?hl=en">Google Fi’s data sim</a>. Until now I’ve always been fine with tethering my iPad to my phone, but international travel makes that impossible due to Google’s restrictions, and since it’s essentially a free add-on, it seems like a no-brainer.</p><p>As of this year, I carry my iPad to most meetings, and almost always bring it instead of my Mac on trips—even for work. This new OS ensures that this will keep being the case. Macs will keep being a great option for my desk at work, but more and more, the iPad and the iPhone are where I prefer to do my computing.</p><p>If you haven’t checked out an iPad in a while, this fall will be a really good time to do so. You might not love it as much as I do, but it might surprise you.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>2018 iPad Pro Review</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-07-new-ipad-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-07-new-ipad-review/</guid><description>Today my phone buzzed to tell me my new iPad had arrived at my office. I rushed down to the mailroom, and eagerly ripped open the packaging.</description><content:encoded><p>Today my phone buzzed to tell me my new iPad had arrived at my office. I rushed down to the mailroom, and eagerly ripped open the packaging. For a few years I’ve used an iPad Pro 9.7” as my primary travel computer when I didn’t need to work on Kubernetes/DevOps stuff, and I’ve loved it. Whether I was watching shows on Netflix or Plex that I’d downloaded before a flight, editing my website in Working Copy, or just editing photos and browsing Twitter, this was the machine I wanted to use.</p><p>Now, I have 1.3” more screen, a more lap-capable keyboard, and 120hz refresh, and I couldn’t be happier.</p><p><img src="/photos/ipad.jpeg" alt="iPad"/><h2 id="the-screen">The screen</h2><p>This iPad might not feel like as huge of a revelation to someone who used the 10.5”, but coming from the 9.7”, this screen feels luxurious. The smooth 120hz refresh rate means opening apps, and moving around looks amazing. The color and viewing angles are still the best in the tablet world, and make my even my MacBook feel like a relic of the past. It’s responsive, bright, and a joy to watch tv on.</p><h2 id="the-case">The case</h2><p>My iPad is the Space Grey color, and it looks excellent. The industrial lines of the sides are reminiscent of my favorite iPhone, the 4. Overall the iPad feels thin, and around the weight of my 9.7” even with the added screen size, and when I have it out of the keyboard folio, I don’t want to put it down. This tablet feels great in my hands. I seriously hope that Apple brings this design language to the next generation of iPhones, even though I wonder if they can while still keeping the glass back for wireless charging.</p><h2 id="the-keyboard-folio">The keyboard folio</h2><p>My main use of the iPad is with a keyboard attached, as I use it as a laptop mostly, which sometimes becomes a handheld tablet for reading. I’m still not convinced there needed to be two viewing angles, but the stiffness and lack of weird folding means it feels pretty great in my lap or on a desk. The tablet-mode keyboard against your fingers thing is slightly odd, but it also reminds me of playing the accordion, which I find funny enough to enjoy it. The keys feel nice and responsive, and largely the same as the 9.7” keyboard. If they changed the keys, I can’t tell. I do enjoy the slightly larger size that matches the bigger device, and my mistypes are few and far-between. Clicking the iPad into the folio feels fast and easy, even if it requires slightly more lining up than previously. With the folio closed, the iPad feel grippy, and like a thin notebook in the best way. The weight and feel, in my opinion, remind you that you’re holding a high quality device. The folio adds a little thickness, but I think it only brings the device to the previous size, so I haven’t felt like it was too thick.</p><h2 id="usb-c">USB-C</h2><p>It’s great. I love using the same charger for this iPad and my MacBook. I already invested in USB-C to lighting cables, so bringing this iPad and no USB spare battery for my iPhone sounds great. I haven’t tried plugging anything weird into the port, but folks at the Verge did their damndest to stump the port.<em>Spoiler</em> it doesn’t work with printers.</p><h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2><p>It’s about the same as my old iPad, which is excellent.</p><h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2><p>There’s four of them. They’re loud, and clear. A+</p><h2 id="faceid">FaceID</h2><p>Just as quick and easy as my previous iPhone X, and possibly a little slower than the XS. I can’t quite tell, but I feel a little like I’m waiting now compared to using my phone. I haven’t timed it though, but generally it’s much better and easier than the TouchID.</p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2><p>This is the iPad to get—whether you get the 12.9” or the 11”, especially if you haven’t upgraded in a few years. I seriously feel like this is the future of Apple computing, and iOS 13 is sure to bring more advanced features that mean I might not need a Mac outside of my office.</p></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
