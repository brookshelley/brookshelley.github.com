Plenty of time to read, watch movies, and play Civ 6 (and keep losing). I also picked-up Gran Turismo and raced virtual cars for countless hours. This month felt like a year.
Books Polaris Rising — Jessie Mihalik
A mix of space caper and Harlequin Romance, there was entirely too much straight sex in this for me. But, if you think “space operas should have more picking out dresses and rough hands on waists,” then this is the book for you.</description></item><item><title>february</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2020-03-01-february/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2020-03-01-february/</guid><description>XOXO it was the month of love&amp;hellip; for my new bike, and my always valentine Snorri. I watched a lot more movies this month than I read books, but that felt alright. Video games were also a theme, with lots of Witcher 3 and Dead Souls to keep me occupied. I also powered through a number of TV shows, like the Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan and the October Faction.</description></item></channel></rss>
