If you‚Äôve waited for a while to get a new phone, or really want something smaller,<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-12-top-features/">you might just be in luck</a>. Whether the rumors amount to anything, Apple is definitely launching something on Tuesday. I‚Äôll be tuning in.</p><p>More than the phone even, I‚Äôm excited to see if they actually ship a computer with their own silicon. It seems like the main feature will be performance, with a side of excellent battery life. I can‚Äôt wait.</p><p>Other than tech shit, this week was nice and chill. The smoke outside continues to plague my bike rides, and the plague is a constant worry, but those are almost background pain at this point.</p><p>I hope you‚Äôre taking it easy as well, and that you have a neighbor who gives you bonus fruits from their trees! Thanks Haley for the amazing passion fruit!</p><p>This week should be good, so let‚Äôs get to it:</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li>It‚Äôs always good to start off your Sunday with a little bit of dancing:</li></ul><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">thread of moments from the star wars weekends dance offs at disney world because I CANT BELIEVE THIS WAS A REAL THING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED<a href="https://t.co/odwaFnQ5Rs">pic.twitter.com/odwaFnQ5Rs</a></p>&mdash; caitlin üçÅ (@SITHLEIAS)<a href="https://twitter.com/SITHLEIAS/status/1313240578566492161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2020</a></blockquote><script async= src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"/><ul><li>But remember, while you dance (outside) be sure to wear a<a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/tom-bihn-v3-three-layer-cloth-face-mask/">good mask</a> and stay well-away from your fellow Ewoks.</li><li>I just learned that my way too brilliant coworker Bert<a href="https://bert.org/2020/10/01/pressing-yubikeys/">made a finger to tap his Yubikey</a>.
