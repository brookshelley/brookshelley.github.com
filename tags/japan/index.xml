Previously, I wrote about my time in Asakusa.</em></p><h2 id="last-day-in-asakusa">Last day in Asakusa</h2><p>What was supposed to be my last day in Asakusa started late. The combination of tiredness and a very comfortable bed meant I slept in until 1pm. I played Animal Crossing for a while, then went to get ramen.</p><p>Later, I headed to Kamakura to meet up with<a href="https://www.craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> who showed me around his neighborhood, and chatted with me about the world, design, and reading. It really changes the nature of trips abroad when you have friends in various cities, I’ve found. I’m lucky to have a few friends scattered around Japan, so I’ve got a few mini-trips I can take each time I visit. Hopefully I’ll get to see Craig again in November for his writing retreat in Yoshino. I’m pretty excited to do a lot of hiking with him and the other participants.</p><p>That night, I said bye to Craig, then got ramen at a Michelin-starred spot in Kamakura, then headed back to Tokyo for some fried chicken and conbini chuhai. I caught up on tv, then got to bed on the early side.</p><h2 id="real-last-day-in-asakusa">Real last day in Asakusa</h2><p>I woke up, packed, and got coffee downstairs. I took my time because I had to kill 6 or so hours until my flight home. A coworker (hi Ricky) met up with me at Fuglen in Asakusa to get coffee and chat about the state of the world for a while, and then I introduced him to the joy of Lemon Chuhais before we parted at the subway.</p><p>After a brief misadventure at the wrong airline terminal, and some confusion about whether or not my flight was cancelled, I made it into the airline terminal, and found a window seat at the airline lounge. Shockingly, they had Georgian orange wine on tap, so I definitely enjoyed my last few hours before my flight.</p><p>The flight was bumpy as hell, but I managed to sleep for a bit.</p><p>And now, I&rsquo;m home&hellip; quarantined like the rest of California.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 4</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-22-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-four/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-22-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-four/</guid><description>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan.

Previously, I wrote about my time in Onomichi.</em></p><h2 id="yakitori-party焼き鳥のパーテイ">Yakitori party/焼き鳥のパーテイ</h2><p>After a drink at my hotel’s bar, I got a hot tip to check out a yakitori place a ten-minute walk away. I threw on my coat, and walked over, enjoying the peace and darkness of a city that actually sleeps.</p><p>The place was called 鳥徳 or Toritoku, and immediately on entering I was befriended by a Brazilian guy and his partner and their older math teacher friend. We talked for a while about tattoos, and drinking, and I mostly kept up in Japanese, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I stayed after they left, and then met a cadre of carpenters, including a very grateful American man named Jason (hi Jason!). The drinking continued as we cleared the place of all of its chicken bits, and all gotta a little cheerier and a little louder.</p><p>Finally, around midnight, I left to walk home. Somehow I’d spent quite a bit of money, and was a bit more tipsy than I figured. When I got back to my hotel, I had the presence of mind to take a bath, and wash all my clothes, then throw a few things on the charger for the next day.</p><p>I had an inkling I’d have a hangover&hellip;</p><h2 id="二日酔い">二日酔い</h2><p>Ouch. I woke up with a wanging headache, and managed to get dressed and fill myself with the multi-course breakfast, including a very tall dairy-free pancake. I finished packing, then checked out of my hotel, quickly hopping on the phone with Chase to address my ticket issue and try to head back to the states earlier, in light of the US state department’s recommendation.</p><p><em>Cut to four hours later</em></p><p>Good news: I started playing animal crossing
Bad news: Chase never picked up (shakes fist at Chase Bank), and at the four hour mark, the call suddenly disconnected. What. The. Fuck.</p><p>I gave up.</p><p>I walked around for a while to find ramen and at least fill the hole in my stomach.</p><h2 id="back-to-tokyo">Back to Tokyo</h2><p>Freshly full of karaage and ramen from a cute local shop, I hopped on the X train, followed by a trip on the Nozomi high-speed Shinkansen to Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, I spent the whole train trip playing Animal Crossing and trying to appease that bastard Tom Nook.</p><h3 id="animal-crossing-interlude">Animal Crossing interlude</h3><p>Animal Crossing was a favorite of mine in college on the GameCube, and each iteration is a simple joy. The Switch update is the best version yet, and looks gorgeous. If you’re the type of person who enjoys games like Harvest Moon, or just has a lot of time over the next few months while we’re all social distancing, I highly recommend picking this game up. Email or text me for my friend code so we can trade fruit, or whatever. My island is called Lesbos. So far we only have peaches on Lesbos, which is kind of a cliche, but oh well.</p><h2 id="asakusa">Asakusa</h2><p>Found my hotel, and checked-in. There was art all over the place, including some from<a href="https://www.frankie-cihi.com">Frankie Cihi</a> from Terrace House. Dinner was a chill diner meal of yakitori and some cucumber stuff while watching a weird 罰ゲーム (punishment game) tv show. I rounded out the night with Devs episode 4 and some Animal Crossing.</p><h2 id="day-two-in-asakusa">Day two in Asakusa</h2><p>It was David’s birthday (hi David), so I woke up at 8:30am to play Animal Crossing with him and his pals. This continued through breakfast, where Haley (hi Haley) even visited my new island.</p><p>Later, I went to Fuglen for coffee and was recognized from tv by a Kanae and her boyfriend. I read for a while over a tasty cup of Columbian coffee, then headed back to my hotel for some shochu. After a shiokoji shochu-induced nap, I headed to get onigiri from the oldest onigiri shop in Tokyo, Yadoroku. Wow. It was so, so good. Afterwards I wandered around and ran into my first 外国人を入れない on this trip. Dang.</p><p>I ended up at a shop called 初代チョベリバ for a few drinks and chicken parts, then went home to read and watch tv.</p><p>Overall, a pretty chill day.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic Travel: 3</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/</guid><description>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan.

Previously, I wrote about my time in Osaka.</em></p><h2 id="heading-south">Heading south</h2><p>Hopping on a call in the morning with Haley, Drl, and Zech was a nice way to start my last morning in Osaka. Background images were quickly swapped, and everyone was both upbeat, and a little stir-crazy. It felt nice to speak English a little, and hear about the bay and NYC.</p><p>After packing up my stuff, I headed to Lawson for onigiri, then walked towards my go-to coffee shop. Sadly, it was closed for the morning, so I sat and read until I could grab some ramen. I briefly got a little lost near Osaka station, but eventually made my way to the Shinkansen to head to Fukuyama, then Onomichi.</p><p>Transit is the scariest part of this trip.</p><p>Every year, the train journeys are one of my favorite part of coming to Japan, but this time, they feel a little more like steel-encased petri-dishes. The train to Fukuyama was busier than I thought it would be, and I sat next to a very quiet older woman for the 2 hour trip. I’d picked up some water and a lemon chuhai to keep me hydrated and chill during the trip, but since I was still reading Chuck Wendig’s<em>Wanderers</em>, I wasn’t exactly relaxed.</p><p><strong>Top Tip</strong> be careful not to read about plagues while you’re in the middle of one.</p><p>A brief stop in Fukuyama meant a small cup sake, then a local train to Onomichi.</p><h2 id="onomichi">Onomichi</h2><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_view.jpg" alt="onomichi view"/><p>Wow. This town is gorgeous. I fully plan to come back here and spend more serious time when I’m able to in the future. I love the river that runs through the middle of town, and the winding hilly roads and stairs. I learned on my first night that this town is<em>well known</em> for<a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cats-sneaking-security-ken-chan-gosaku-hiroshima-onomichi-city-museum-of-art/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">cats</a>. I’m sure somewhere in the back of my head, I’d seen this and taken note, but mostly I came here to stay at<a href="https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/122/destination-japan/">LOG</a> and relax a little.</p><p>My first day was certainly relaxing after a hike up a hill to get to the hotel. I walked into the lobby sweating profusely and was offered oolong tea. After a brief tour I rested in my room and read. Later I took a long bath (I still can’t get over how wonderful Japanese bathtubs are—they actually<em>fit</em> my whole body), and then got a welcome drink at the bar.</p><p>Wow! They had<em>natural wine from Alsace</em>. Honestly LOG felt like a heaven—a retreat and a recharge from my worries. I hope more of you reading this are able to visit in the future, despite the nightly rate being a little steep (~$350 a night).</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_dinner.jpg" alt="dinner"/><p>Dinner was a multi-course vegetable-focused feast with more white and whiskey to go with it. The small restaurant could seat 20, but only myself and two other women (a couple?) were there. It was utterly bizarre to be the only guests in a hotel.</p><p>I chatted with the waiter and the other guests a little about food, drift-racing, and Slack.</p><p>Later I read by my window, and listened to jazz.</p><h2 id="day-two">Day two</h2><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_pancake.jpg" alt="pancake"/><p>I woke a little before my alarm and got ready for the day. My breakfast was served in the same small cafe as dinner, and included the best pancake I’ve had in years. The maple syrup was delightful and not to sweet, and there was coarse sea salt sprinkled over the top to balance the flavor.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_library.jpg" alt="library"/><p>While my room was cleaned, I hung out in the library of the hotel with the windows open, despite the construction on the street outside. The sawing and jackhammering was somehow oddly soothing. I liked the idea that despite everything, this crew was still repairing a mountain path hundreds of years older than my own country.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_library_view.jpg" alt="view from library"/><p>From what I’ve read, Onomichi was spared from bombing during the war, so many of the houses I see around are a very old style, with tiled roofs and small engawas. If it wasn’t for the electrical lines running overhead, my view from the library window would’ve seemed like time-travel.</p><p>It was gorgeous.</p><h2 id="cat-hunting">Cat hunting</h2><p>Later, I walked on the literature path all the way up to an observation point, and also visited the famous Tadao Ando-designed museum. I saw more than a few cats, but fellow was my favorite. We sat together for five minutes or so and appreciated the view.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/mr_cat.jpg" alt="mr cat"/><p>All told I climbed 50 flights of steps during my hike. I only saw one other foreigner, but made sure to greet the older folks I walked past in the neighborhood with a cheerful 「こんにちは！」.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/elephant.jpg" alt="I later learned photographs were prohibited"/><p>The museum had so much great cat art. I’m not a huge fine art lady, but even I enjoyed the 18th and 19th century Japanese paintings. It was pretty funny to see how white people were depicted in these paintings—all the bearded cello-playing weirdos from Holland and Portugal.</p><p>I also saw a mini-museum to the maneki neko while on the short cat alley walk, and later visited a few temples.</p><p>Overall, I loved the hike, and all the spectacular views of the city and the hills to the north and west of Onomichi.</p><h2 id="lunch-and-relaxing">Lunch and relaxing</h2><p>After a climb down the hill, I dropped by a 7/11 to pick up cash, then got ramen at a shop that I<em>think</em> used beef lard in the stock. I’m unclear. It was called 牛ちゃん, but the ramen had tonkatsu, and I also got karaage, so who knows. It was tasty though, with a Hakata-style straight noodle.</p><p>I made a fresh cup of Haiku-roasted Ethiopian coffee beans, and read for a while before exploring the city more for dinner.</p><p>I knew I would be sad to leave this place on Friday.</p><p><em>read<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">part 1</a> or<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/">part 2</a></em></p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 2</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/</guid><description>Wow, things sure are quiet&amp;hellip;

After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about packing and my initial few days in Koenji in western Tokyo.</em></p><h2 id="off-to-kyoto">Off to Kyoto</h2><p>Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience. If you’ve ever been to Japan, there’s a near-constant mass of people traveling via train stations, so I was both sad and glad to see folks taking none traveling seriously. I picked up an ekiben of box sushi and a chuhai, then headed to the old capital city for one night at BNA Alter Hotel, the Kyoto cousin of Koenji’s BNA.</p><p>In general, Kyoto was also much quieter, but had a slightly upbeat vibe and a bit more foot traffic than I saw in Tokyo. I think the smaller number of COVID cases meant Kyoto kept moving.</p><p>I found some amazing yakitori for dinner and drank a few glasses of fancy whiskey later on back at my hotel. I watched Contagion before drifting off to sleep, and it unfortunately felt prescient. I hope we have more Matt Damons and less Gwyneth Paltrows in our current pandemic.</p><p>Day two meant a solo breakfast at the hotel. There were only two of us there in the entire 31 room place. Wild.</p><p>I went on a walk later, to get some air, and come coffee at Dongree, where I also sat alone. On the way to the train station I got ramen at an empty shop run by two older people who were very happy to have me. One downside of this spot—they didn’t have hand soap in the restroom. Fortunately, I was carrying alcohol wipes, but I made a note to find alcohol spray at the next conbini I visited.</p><h2 id="osaka">Osaka</h2><p>The train ride to Osaka was a little nerve-wracking. The small train got much more crowded than any other train I’d been on, and the asshole youth who sat next to me picked his nose under his mask and coughed into his mask for a few stops. The older woman sitting near us kept giving him the stink eye. Seriously, fuck that guy.</p><p>I made it to my hotel a little early, and sat in the lobby before check-in. In a stark contrast to my huge room in Kyoto, the Nest hotel is a very tiny business hotel. I wasn’t really clear on the amenities when I booked it, but it’s basically a room large enough for a bed and a small chair. I spent most of the first night in my room, with a short excursion to get udon nearby. Later I watched Casino Royale, and had a canned highball. Truly high class, eh?</p><p>Every morning so far has meant catching up on the news around the world, practicing kanji, and trying to keep a little calm. I definitely felt more anxious in Osaka than in Koenji or Kyoto. Everyone outside seems much more blasé than other parts of Japan I’ve been to on this trip, despite the higher infection rate here.</p><p><em>knocks on wood</em> I hope this apparent nonchalance is fully warranted, and folks here will stay healthy.</p><p>I got Vietnamese food in an empty restaurant with my friends Laurie and Stephan, and then got coffee at Haiku, a local spot I love. Later I took a leisurely walk, followed by a little chuhai purchasing at the Lawson. Having a beer in my hotel room isn’t as great as a nice whiskey out, but I figured it’s better safe than sorry.</p><p>Day two meant a long walk after buying some onigiri at the Lawson. Crowds were sparse, but a surprising number of people were still walking around and playing baseball in the park. I’d just read about the shutdown in San Francisco, and Osaka felt like the opposite. I got more coffee at Haiku, and made sure to buy extra pourover bags to-go so I would have backup coffee for my time in Onomichi.</p><p>I spent the afternoon back at my hotel, watching sim-racing championships and napping. Later I got karaage and more chuhai at Johnny’s, then walked back under the subway line, and listened to a podcast. I felt lucky in a way that I could still experience wandering around Osaka during this pandemic, but also scared for what lies ahead for my friends and our homes.</p><p>Lawsons came through with another chuhai for my tv-filled evening. First up was the finale of Avenue 5, and then Quantum of Solace. Uncomplicated action movies are a nice escape, I think.</p><p>I set my alarm for a video call with my friend Haley, then headed to bed.</p><p><em>read<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">part 1</a> or<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/">part 3</a></em></p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 1</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/</guid><description>Wow, things sure are quiet&amp;hellip;

After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the following weeks COVID-19 grew at a wild rate, the cases in the United States were clearly skyrocketing despite a complete failure of the CDC and leadership to provide ample testing. My company cancelled business travel, but left it to us to determine our risk profile for personal travel, so I reached out to friends in the US and Japan to take stock. After a weekend of thinking and reading, I decided to travel to Japan unless flights were cancelled.</p><h2 id="the-trip-begins">The trip begins</h2><p>Many travelers had clearly cancelled their flights, as the plane was largely empty. Out of caution and care for passengers, the staff of the JAL plane were all wearing masks, and taking extra measures to clean and prepare our plane as well. As I boarded and settled-in, my first thought was “I wish folks too health this seriously all the time”.</p><p>Our flight was fairly bumpy, but I managed to sleep for a few hours, and even eat a bit before landing at HND. The usual self-service immigration booths were closed, but as one of the only visitors, I still made it through immigration and customs in minutes. As usual, the customs agent gave me an odd look for my small backpack and lack of luggage.</p><h2 id="the-bag">The bag</h2><p>This trip I brought a single bag: the<a href="https://bellroy.com/products/studio-backpack/venture/black">Bellroy Studio in Venture Weave Black</a>. After many trips with my RYU Quick Pack with a smaller day bag, I looked forward to a single light bag instead. So far on this trip, it’s been a comfortable bag, that easily hauls between locations. I haven’t used it very much outside of traveling to my hotels, as due to the virus I haven’t done a lot of writing from coffee shops or hiking. I used this bag daily for the past few months to go to work though, and am confident it would also be great to take a couple things with me to a coffee shop.</p><p>My packing list was pretty typical:</p><h3 id="clothes">Clothes</h3><ul><li>1 pairs of<a href="https://darntough.com/products/womens-ss18-vertex-no-show-tab-ultra-light">Darn Tough wool socks</a></li><li>1<a href="https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-tops/cool-lite-solace-short-sleeve-scoop/104640.html">wool shirt from Icebreaker</a></li><li>1 pair of<a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/rectrek-pant">RekTrek pants from OV</a></li><li>1<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Peak-Womens-Rain-Trench/dp/B07MWC4KZ8">Snow Peak FR trench</a></li><li>2 pairs of<a href="https://negativeunderwear.com/collections/underwear/products/black-whipped-high-rise">Negative underwear</a></li><li>1 sports bra</li><li>1<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcteryx-Eagan-Tank-Top-Womens/dp/B078XHPXJH/ref=pd_sbs_468_4/136-2112403-2472869">tank from Arcteryx</a></li><li>1 pair of<a href="https://www.foxers.com/boxer-briefs/">shorts from Foxers</a></li></ul><h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3><ul><li>iPad 11” Cellular</li><li>Kindle Oasis</li><li>Switch Lite</li><li>Anker 10kmah battery</li><li>Cables</li><li><a href="https://satechi.net/products/usb-c-magnetic-charging-dock">Satechi watch charger</a> (got this for free from a Satechi rep.

By and large, I kept to my room, or did some socially-distanced hiking around Suginami. Lawson was a block away, and provided coffee and onigiri, but I also had coffees at Coffee AMP and INC near the train station. Honestly, other than mounting panic online, I found it to be relaxing to stick close to home. I went out for food a couple of times, but honestly felt a little afraid to go out. If I were in Oakland right now, it’s likely I wouldn’t have left the house this week at all, save for a walk around the block.</p><h2 id="to-be-continued">To be continued&hellip;</h2><p><em>read<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/">part 2</a> or<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/">part 3</a></em></p></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
