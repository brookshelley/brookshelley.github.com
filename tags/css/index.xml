I’ve lost lots of data in the past, and ultimately it’s just much easier to keep text portable and backed-up when it’s a .txt or .md
In the ensuing years, I’ve written a few blog posts, and listed tons of books and movies but I hadn’t done much with my site’s structure or design besides moving my static site generator from Jekyll to Hugo on a whim last year.</description></item></channel></rss>
