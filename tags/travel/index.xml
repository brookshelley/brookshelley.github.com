In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.</p><p>In a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.</p><h2 id="heavy">Heavy</h2><p>My first thought when I took the Magic Keyboard package out of the mailbox was, “yow, this<em>is</em> heavy.” After taking the keyboard out of its packaging, the heft remained, but once I attached my iPad to it and started typing, I forgot all about the weight. Sure, this will be a bit heavier for travel, but the modularity is worth it for me. I can’t wait to type on this while traveling, then pull the iPad off the keyboard to carry around for reading in a park, or watching a tv show. It makes me wish it were possible to pull the screen off of my work computer and walk around with it too!</p><h2 id="modular">Modular</h2><p>Ever since getting the Smart Keyboard, my iPad basically never left it. I carried my iPad around daily, fingers pressed into the keys awkwardly on the back of the screen. The previous keyboard for the iPad was also super strange in its own way, but looking back, having a primary iPad case expose you to the keyboard buttons constantly when all you want to do is read is so silly. This new Magic Keyboard makes no concessions to using it while<em>not</em> typing. The ease of removing the iPad from the keyboard (I’m almost tempted to call it a dock) is such that I don’t even think about taking my iPad with me to another room, sans keyboard. This mode-changing makes the iPad feel even more futuristic than it did before, especially because my hands are only now becoming accustomed to the thin, metallic body of the iPad, instead of the strange rubber skin of the keyboard case its lived in up until now.</p><h2 id="thunk">Thunk</h2><p>So, what’s the keyboard actually like to type on?</p><p>Fantastic.</p><p>Unlike most folks, I really enjoyed both the butterfly keyboard in my MacBook, and the cloth-covered one on the Smart Keyboard. I enjoyed the short-travel, and the weird texture, but the feel and thunk of this new keyboard is even better. I don’t really care about the backlighting, and I’m a little bit more concerned about the gaps that invite in stray drops of water, but as I mentioned above, I don’t plan to carry this with me all the time, so it’s more likely I’ll have a glass of wine sans non-waterproof keyboard, and keep drinks away when I plan to<em>type</em>.</p><p>I typed this review on the new keyboard, and the experience was absolutely fantastic. The new trackpad<em>is</em> small, but the ability to quickly laser-target my edits is a delight. No longer do I have to tap, stab, tap tap, arrow, arrow, arrow. I can just point, and click, and voila. When I’m not at work, I more or less<em>only</em> use my iPad, and this new keyboard means the typing I do will be faster, feel better, and even sound more pleasingly thunky.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-it">Should you buy it?</h2><p>Do you type on your iPad? Do you want to? Have you been tempted to plug your iPad into a monitor and use a Bluetooth trackpad? Do you love writing on the go?</p><p>If so, then this is probably the right keyboard for you. If you only occasionally reach for your iPad to watch YouTube videos, or are the kind of person who thinks traveling with an iPad<strong>and</strong> a MacBook is totally acceptable, then save your $300. In the same way that I’ve never purchased an Apple Pencil, many iPad users will never purchase this keyboard, and I think that’s totally fine. But the folks that do buy one, and get to experience the entirely wonderful experience of typing and editing will be incredibly satisfied, I think.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 5</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-24-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-five/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-24-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-five/</guid><description>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan.

The combination of tiredness and a very comfortable bed meant I slept in until 1pm. I played Animal Crossing for a while, then went to get ramen.</p><p>Later, I headed to Kamakura to meet up with<a href="https://www.craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> who showed me around his neighborhood, and chatted with me about the world, design, and reading. It really changes the nature of trips abroad when you have friends in various cities, I’ve found. I’m lucky to have a few friends scattered around Japan, so I’ve got a few mini-trips I can take each time I visit. Hopefully I’ll get to see Craig again in November for his writing retreat in Yoshino. I’m pretty excited to do a lot of hiking with him and the other participants.</p><p>That night, I said bye to Craig, then got ramen at a Michelin-starred spot in Kamakura, then headed back to Tokyo for some fried chicken and conbini chuhai. I caught up on tv, then got to bed on the early side.</p><h2 id="real-last-day-in-asakusa">Real last day in Asakusa</h2><p>I woke up, packed, and got coffee downstairs. I took my time because I had to kill 6 or so hours until my flight home. A coworker (hi Ricky) met up with me at Fuglen in Asakusa to get coffee and chat about the state of the world for a while, and then I introduced him to the joy of Lemon Chuhais before we parted at the subway.</p><p>After a brief misadventure at the wrong airline terminal, and some confusion about whether or not my flight was cancelled, I made it into the airline terminal, and found a window seat at the airline lounge. Shockingly, they had Georgian orange wine on tap, so I definitely enjoyed my last few hours before my flight.</p><p>The flight was bumpy as hell, but I managed to sleep for a bit.</p><p>And now, I&rsquo;m home&hellip; quarantined like the rest of California.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 4</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-22-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-four/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-22-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-four/</guid><description>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan.

I threw on my coat, and walked over, enjoying the peace and darkness of a city that actually sleeps.</p><p>The place was called 鳥徳 or Toritoku, and immediately on entering I was befriended by a Brazilian guy and his partner and their older math teacher friend. We talked for a while about tattoos, and drinking, and I mostly kept up in Japanese, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I stayed after they left, and then met a cadre of carpenters, including a very grateful American man named Jason (hi Jason!). The drinking continued as we cleared the place of all of its chicken bits, and all gotta a little cheerier and a little louder.</p><p>Finally, around midnight, I left to walk home. Somehow I’d spent quite a bit of money, and was a bit more tipsy than I figured. When I got back to my hotel, I had the presence of mind to take a bath, and wash all my clothes, then throw a few things on the charger for the next day.</p><p>I had an inkling I’d have a hangover&hellip;</p><h2 id="二日酔い">二日酔い</h2><p>Ouch. I woke up with a wanging headache, and managed to get dressed and fill myself with the multi-course breakfast, including a very tall dairy-free pancake. I finished packing, then checked out of my hotel, quickly hopping on the phone with Chase to address my ticket issue and try to head back to the states earlier, in light of the US state department’s recommendation.</p><p><em>Cut to four hours later</em></p><p>Good news: I started playing animal crossing
Bad news: Chase never picked up (shakes fist at Chase Bank), and at the four hour mark, the call suddenly disconnected. What. The. Fuck.</p><p>I gave up.</p><p>I walked around for a while to find ramen and at least fill the hole in my stomach.</p><h2 id="back-to-tokyo">Back to Tokyo</h2><p>Freshly full of karaage and ramen from a cute local shop, I hopped on the X train, followed by a trip on the Nozomi high-speed Shinkansen to Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, I spent the whole train trip playing Animal Crossing and trying to appease that bastard Tom Nook.</p><h3 id="animal-crossing-interlude">Animal Crossing interlude</h3><p>Animal Crossing was a favorite of mine in college on the GameCube, and each iteration is a simple joy. The Switch update is the best version yet, and looks gorgeous. If you’re the type of person who enjoys games like Harvest Moon, or just has a lot of time over the next few months while we’re all social distancing, I highly recommend picking this game up. Email or text me for my friend code so we can trade fruit, or whatever. My island is called Lesbos. So far we only have peaches on Lesbos, which is kind of a cliche, but oh well.</p><h2 id="asakusa">Asakusa</h2><p>Found my hotel, and checked-in. There was art all over the place, including some from<a href="https://www.frankie-cihi.com">Frankie Cihi</a> from Terrace House. Dinner was a chill diner meal of yakitori and some cucumber stuff while watching a weird 罰ゲーム (punishment game) tv show. I rounded out the night with Devs episode 4 and some Animal Crossing.</p><h2 id="day-two-in-asakusa">Day two in Asakusa</h2><p>It was David’s birthday (hi David), so I woke up at 8:30am to play Animal Crossing with him and his pals. This continued through breakfast, where Haley (hi Haley) even visited my new island.</p><p>Later, I went to Fuglen for coffee and was recognized from tv by a Kanae and her boyfriend. I read for a while over a tasty cup of Columbian coffee, then headed back to my hotel for some shochu. After a shiokoji shochu-induced nap, I headed to get onigiri from the oldest onigiri shop in Tokyo, Yadoroku. Wow. It was so, so good. Afterwards I wandered around and ran into my first 外国人を入れない on this trip. Dang.</p><p>I ended up at a shop called 初代チョベリバ for a few drinks and chicken parts, then went home to read and watch tv.</p><p>Overall, a pretty chill day.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic Travel: 3</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/</guid><description>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan.

Previously, I wrote about my time in Osaka.</em></p><h2 id="heading-south">Heading south</h2><p>Hopping on a call in the morning with Haley, Drl, and Zech was a nice way to start my last morning in Osaka. Background images were quickly swapped, and everyone was both upbeat, and a little stir-crazy. It felt nice to speak English a little, and hear about the bay and NYC.</p><p>After packing up my stuff, I headed to Lawson for onigiri, then walked towards my go-to coffee shop. Sadly, it was closed for the morning, so I sat and read until I could grab some ramen. I briefly got a little lost near Osaka station, but eventually made my way to the Shinkansen to head to Fukuyama, then Onomichi.</p><p>Transit is the scariest part of this trip.</p><p>Every year, the train journeys are one of my favorite part of coming to Japan, but this time, they feel a little more like steel-encased petri-dishes. The train to Fukuyama was busier than I thought it would be, and I sat next to a very quiet older woman for the 2 hour trip. I’d picked up some water and a lemon chuhai to keep me hydrated and chill during the trip, but since I was still reading Chuck Wendig’s<em>Wanderers</em>, I wasn’t exactly relaxed.</p><p><strong>Top Tip</strong> be careful not to read about plagues while you’re in the middle of one.</p><p>A brief stop in Fukuyama meant a small cup sake, then a local train to Onomichi.</p><h2 id="onomichi">Onomichi</h2><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_view.jpg" alt="onomichi view"/><p>Wow. This town is gorgeous. I fully plan to come back here and spend more serious time when I’m able to in the future. I love the river that runs through the middle of town, and the winding hilly roads and stairs. I learned on my first night that this town is<em>well known</em> for<a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cats-sneaking-security-ken-chan-gosaku-hiroshima-onomichi-city-museum-of-art/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">cats</a>. I’m sure somewhere in the back of my head, I’d seen this and taken note, but mostly I came here to stay at<a href="https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/122/destination-japan/">LOG</a> and relax a little.</p><p>My first day was certainly relaxing after a hike up a hill to get to the hotel. I walked into the lobby sweating profusely and was offered oolong tea. After a brief tour I rested in my room and read. Later I took a long bath (I still can’t get over how wonderful Japanese bathtubs are—they actually<em>fit</em> my whole body), and then got a welcome drink at the bar.</p><p>Wow! They had<em>natural wine from Alsace</em>. Honestly LOG felt like a heaven—a retreat and a recharge from my worries. I hope more of you reading this are able to visit in the future, despite the nightly rate being a little steep (~$350 a night).</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_dinner.jpg" alt="dinner"/><p>Dinner was a multi-course vegetable-focused feast with more white and whiskey to go with it. The small restaurant could seat 20, but only myself and two other women (a couple?) were there. It was utterly bizarre to be the only guests in a hotel.</p><p>I chatted with the waiter and the other guests a little about food, drift-racing, and Slack.</p><p>Later I read by my window, and listened to jazz.</p><h2 id="day-two">Day two</h2><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_pancake.jpg" alt="pancake"/><p>I woke a little before my alarm and got ready for the day. My breakfast was served in the same small cafe as dinner, and included the best pancake I’ve had in years. The maple syrup was delightful and not to sweet, and there was coarse sea salt sprinkled over the top to balance the flavor.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_library.jpg" alt="library"/><p>While my room was cleaned, I hung out in the library of the hotel with the windows open, despite the construction on the street outside. The sawing and jackhammering was somehow oddly soothing. I liked the idea that despite everything, this crew was still repairing a mountain path hundreds of years older than my own country.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_library_view.jpg" alt="view from library"/><p>From what I’ve read, Onomichi was spared from bombing during the war, so many of the houses I see around are a very old style, with tiled roofs and small engawas. If it wasn’t for the electrical lines running overhead, my view from the library window would’ve seemed like time-travel.</p><p>It was gorgeous.</p><h2 id="cat-hunting">Cat hunting</h2><p>Later, I walked on the literature path all the way up to an observation point, and also visited the famous Tadao Ando-designed museum. I saw more than a few cats, but fellow was my favorite. We sat together for five minutes or so and appreciated the view.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/mr_cat.jpg" alt="mr cat"/><p>All told I climbed 50 flights of steps during my hike. I only saw one other foreigner, but made sure to greet the older folks I walked past in the neighborhood with a cheerful 「こんにちは！」.</p><p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/elephant.jpg" alt="I later learned photographs were prohibited"/><p>The museum had so much great cat art. I’m not a huge fine art lady, but even I enjoyed the 18th and 19th century Japanese paintings. It was pretty funny to see how white people were depicted in these paintings—all the bearded cello-playing weirdos from Holland and Portugal.</p><p>I also saw a mini-museum to the maneki neko while on the short cat alley walk, and later visited a few temples.</p><p>Overall, I loved the hike, and all the spectacular views of the city and the hills to the north and west of Onomichi.</p><h2 id="lunch-and-relaxing">Lunch and relaxing</h2><p>After a climb down the hill, I dropped by a 7/11 to pick up cash, then got ramen at a shop that I<em>think</em> used beef lard in the stock. I’m unclear. It was called 牛ちゃん, but the ramen had tonkatsu, and I also got karaage, so who knows. It was tasty though, with a Hakata-style straight noodle.</p><p>I made a fresh cup of Haiku-roasted Ethiopian coffee beans, and read for a while before exploring the city more for dinner.</p><p>I knew I would be sad to leave this place on Friday.</p><p><em>read<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">part 1</a> or<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/">part 2</a></em></p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 2</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/</guid><description>Wow, things sure are quiet&amp;hellip;

Off to Kyoto Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience.</description><content:encoded><p><strong>Wow, things sure are quiet&hellip;</strong></p><p><em>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan.

Previously, I wrote about packing and my initial few days in Koenji in western Tokyo.</em></p><h2 id="off-to-kyoto">Off to Kyoto</h2><p>Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience. If you’ve ever been to Japan, there’s a near-constant mass of people traveling via train stations, so I was both sad and glad to see folks taking none traveling seriously. I picked up an ekiben of box sushi and a chuhai, then headed to the old capital city for one night at BNA Alter Hotel, the Kyoto cousin of Koenji’s BNA.</p><p>In general, Kyoto was also much quieter, but had a slightly upbeat vibe and a bit more foot traffic than I saw in Tokyo. I think the smaller number of COVID cases meant Kyoto kept moving.</p><p>I found some amazing yakitori for dinner and drank a few glasses of fancy whiskey later on back at my hotel. I watched Contagion before drifting off to sleep, and it unfortunately felt prescient. I hope we have more Matt Damons and less Gwyneth Paltrows in our current pandemic.</p><p>Day two meant a solo breakfast at the hotel. There were only two of us there in the entire 31 room place. Wild.</p><p>I went on a walk later, to get some air, and come coffee at Dongree, where I also sat alone. On the way to the train station I got ramen at an empty shop run by two older people who were very happy to have me. One downside of this spot—they didn’t have hand soap in the restroom. Fortunately, I was carrying alcohol wipes, but I made a note to find alcohol spray at the next conbini I visited.</p><h2 id="osaka">Osaka</h2><p>The train ride to Osaka was a little nerve-wracking. The small train got much more crowded than any other train I’d been on, and the asshole youth who sat next to me picked his nose under his mask and coughed into his mask for a few stops. The older woman sitting near us kept giving him the stink eye. Seriously, fuck that guy.</p><p>I made it to my hotel a little early, and sat in the lobby before check-in. In a stark contrast to my huge room in Kyoto, the Nest hotel is a very tiny business hotel. I wasn’t really clear on the amenities when I booked it, but it’s basically a room large enough for a bed and a small chair. I spent most of the first night in my room, with a short excursion to get udon nearby. Later I watched Casino Royale, and had a canned highball. Truly high class, eh?</p><p>Every morning so far has meant catching up on the news around the world, practicing kanji, and trying to keep a little calm. I definitely felt more anxious in Osaka than in Koenji or Kyoto. Everyone outside seems much more blasé than other parts of Japan I’ve been to on this trip, despite the higher infection rate here.</p><p><em>knocks on wood</em> I hope this apparent nonchalance is fully warranted, and folks here will stay healthy.</p><p>I got Vietnamese food in an empty restaurant with my friends Laurie and Stephan, and then got coffee at Haiku, a local spot I love. Later I took a leisurely walk, followed by a little chuhai purchasing at the Lawson. Having a beer in my hotel room isn’t as great as a nice whiskey out, but I figured it’s better safe than sorry.</p><p>Day two meant a long walk after buying some onigiri at the Lawson. Crowds were sparse, but a surprising number of people were still walking around and playing baseball in the park. I’d just read about the shutdown in San Francisco, and Osaka felt like the opposite. I got more coffee at Haiku, and made sure to buy extra pourover bags to-go so I would have backup coffee for my time in Onomichi.</p><p>I spent the afternoon back at my hotel, watching sim-racing championships and napping. Later I got karaage and more chuhai at Johnny’s, then walked back under the subway line, and listened to a podcast. I felt lucky in a way that I could still experience wandering around Osaka during this pandemic, but also scared for what lies ahead for my friends and our homes.</p><p>Lawsons came through with another chuhai for my tv-filled evening. First up was the finale of Avenue 5, and then Quantum of Solace. Uncomplicated action movies are a nice escape, I think.</p><p>I set my alarm for a video call with my friend Haley, then headed to bed.</p><p><em>read<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">part 1</a> or<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/">part 3</a></em></p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pandemic travel: 1</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/</guid><description>Wow, things sure are quiet&amp;hellip;

After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the following weeks COVID-19 grew at a wild rate, the cases in the United States were clearly skyrocketing despite a complete failure of the CDC and leadership to provide ample testing. My company cancelled business travel, but left it to us to determine our risk profile for personal travel, so I reached out to friends in the US and Japan to take stock. After a weekend of thinking and reading, I decided to travel to Japan unless flights were cancelled.</p><h2 id="the-trip-begins">The trip begins</h2><p>Many travelers had clearly cancelled their flights, as the plane was largely empty. Out of caution and care for passengers, the staff of the JAL plane were all wearing masks, and taking extra measures to clean and prepare our plane as well. As I boarded and settled-in, my first thought was “I wish folks too health this seriously all the time”.</p><p>Our flight was fairly bumpy, but I managed to sleep for a few hours, and even eat a bit before landing at HND. The usual self-service immigration booths were closed, but as one of the only visitors, I still made it through immigration and customs in minutes. As usual, the customs agent gave me an odd look for my small backpack and lack of luggage.</p><h2 id="the-bag">The bag</h2><p>This trip I brought a single bag: the<a href="https://bellroy.com/products/studio-backpack/venture/black">Bellroy Studio in Venture Weave Black</a>. After many trips with my RYU Quick Pack with a smaller day bag, I looked forward to a single light bag instead. So far on this trip, it’s been a comfortable bag, that easily hauls between locations. I haven’t used it very much outside of traveling to my hotels, as due to the virus I haven’t done a lot of writing from coffee shops or hiking. I used this bag daily for the past few months to go to work though, and am confident it would also be great to take a couple things with me to a coffee shop.</p><p>My packing list was pretty typical:</p><h3 id="clothes">Clothes</h3><ul><li>1 pairs of<a href="https://darntough.com/products/womens-ss18-vertex-no-show-tab-ultra-light">Darn Tough wool socks</a></li><li>1<a href="https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-tops/cool-lite-solace-short-sleeve-scoop/104640.html">wool shirt from Icebreaker</a></li><li>1 pair of<a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/rectrek-pant">RekTrek pants from OV</a></li><li>1<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Peak-Womens-Rain-Trench/dp/B07MWC4KZ8">Snow Peak FR trench</a></li><li>2 pairs of<a href="https://negativeunderwear.com/collections/underwear/products/black-whipped-high-rise">Negative underwear</a></li><li>1 sports bra</li><li>1<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcteryx-Eagan-Tank-Top-Womens/dp/B078XHPXJH/ref=pd_sbs_468_4/136-2112403-2472869">tank from Arcteryx</a></li><li>1 pair of<a href="https://www.foxers.com/boxer-briefs/">shorts from Foxers</a></li></ul><h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3><ul><li>iPad 11” Cellular</li><li>Kindle Oasis</li><li>Switch Lite</li><li>Anker 10kmah battery</li><li>Cables</li><li><a href="https://satechi.net/products/usb-c-magnetic-charging-dock">Satechi watch charger</a> (got this for free from a Satechi rep.

Lawson was a block away, and provided coffee and onigiri, but I also had coffees at Coffee AMP and INC near the train station. Honestly, other than mounting panic online, I found it to be relaxing to stick close to home. I went out for food a couple of times, but honestly felt a little afraid to go out.

What’re you wearing? Whether it’s a one week or one month-long trip, I bring the same things each time Including what I’m wearing during the flight, here’s the breakdown:</description><content:encoded><p>Ten or so years ago, I realized I hated bringing heavy bags with me everywhere I traveled, so I slimmed down my packing to fit in one<a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/05/17/review-invisible-one-mini.html">small backpack</a>.

I usually write a post-trip gear update, but today is all about clothing.</p><h2 id="whatre-you-wearing">What’re you wearing?</h2><p>Whether it’s a one week or one month-long trip, I bring the same things each time Including what I’m wearing during the flight, here’s the breakdown:</p><ul><li>3 pairs of<a href="#underwear">underwear</a></li><li>2<a href="#shirts">shirts</a></li><li>2 sports<a href="#underwear">bras</a></li><li>2 pairs of wool<a href="#shoes">socks</a></li><li>1 water-resistant<a href="#jacket">hoodie</a></li><li>(weather-optional) 1<a href="#jacket">jacket</a></li><li>1 pair of<a href="#shoes">shoes</a></li><li>1 pair of<a href="#pants">pants</a></li><li>1 pair of shorts or<a href="#pants">leggings</a></li></ul><p>None of the stuff I wear is particularly cheap, or particularly expensive, but on the whole, it’s held up well to lots of abuse, and many washes. The key to bringing very little clothing is a willingness to wash your clothes in the sink or shower while you bathe. If you find a washing machine, by all means, take advantage of it, but these clothes dry pretty quickly, and I prefer not to hope for something automated. If something gets destroyed (only happened once with some jeans), I can usually find a replacement, but taking stock before a trip of any of your clothing that’s in danger of ripping is a great plan.</p><h2 id="tops-a-nameshirtsa">Tops</h2><p>Day or night, the tops I wear look pretty good, wick sweat ok, and tend to hold up to a day of hiking. I spent a while only wearing wool, but recently got stoked on a few other shirts. Sadly, Ryu doesn’t make the wool shirt I wear anymore, but there are a bunch of brands making wool shirts these days, so have a look around if that appeals to you.</p><p>Usually, if it’s hot or I plan to layer, I wear a<a href="https://ryu.com/shop/us/women/tops/standard-issue-racerback-tank">tank top</a>. No sleeves means no pit stains, and with a hoodie you’re pretty set regardless of the modesty required in a temple or other spot. I’ve had good luck with Ryu and Lucy (though they’ve been bought by North Face, and I don’t know how good they are anymore). Arcteryx used to make a cool wool tank, but they make<a href="https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/a2b-scoop-neck-shirt-ss">this</a> now, and if it’s the same fabric, it’s great!</p><p>A friend convinced me to try out these<a href="https://jungmaven.com/collections/hemp-core-tees-tshirt-womens/products/hemp-shirt-ojai-tee-short-sleeve-womens?variant=22065464279088">hemp shirts</a>, and for the first time in years, I wear a few colors. They’re super light, super soft, and don’t get stinky after a few wears.</p><p>I wear one of these shirts while I’m sleeping, and one during the day, and kinda rotate them around. If I’m gone for longer I might bring 2 shirts and a tank top, so I don’t have to wash as much.</p><h2 id="bottoms-a-namepantsa">Bottoms</h2><p>Most of the time I wear<a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/rectrek-pant?variant=34894684485">Outdoor Voices RecTrek pants</a>, which are comfy, stretchy, and cute. They run out of sizes all the time or I’d have a couple pairs. They dress up for the office ok, but also handle a<em>lot</em> of walking. Since I can’t find another black XL pair, I am currently trying out<a href="https://coalatree.com/collections/apparel/products/slim-fit-trailhead-pants-black">another brand</a>. These Coalatree pants are also pretty great, though the tie at the bottom of each leg is kinda ridiculous. They’re unisex, which means the fit might be weird, but they’ve also got a<em>ergonomic crotch gusset</em> a la<a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/chuck-norris-action-jeans/">Chuck Norris action jeans</a>. I don’t know<em>why</em> you’d do tons of high kicks in pants, but either of these pairs would handle them with gusto.</p><p>You probably already have your preferred brand of legging, but for me, I’m usually wearing either<a href="https://ryu.com/shop/us/women/bottoms/cardio-tights">Ryu</a> or<a href="https://www.girlfriend.com/collections/leggings/products/black-compressive-high-rise-legging">Girlfriend</a>. I’ve heard great things about Outdoor Voices leggings, but I’m waiting until I destroy a few more old pairs before I try them. For night time, leggings or<a href="https://www.foxers.com/black-tomboy-boxer-brief/">Foxers</a> are great for wandering around my Airbnb or hotel room.</p><h2 id="underwear-a-nameunderweara">Underwear</h2><p>Breathable, light, comfortable, and durable is the name of the game for underwear. I’m always on the search for a pair that hits all four targets. Thus far, some have done ok, but most aren’t that durable. A better pair I tried were<a href="https://knix.com/collections/underwear/products/athletic-bikini">Knix</a>, which were super comfy, but eventually blew up. Sometimes I bring<a href="https://www.meundies.com/products/womens-bikini">MeUndies</a>, but they too tend to fall apart too soon. These wool<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-active-briefs-underwear/32396.html?dwvar_32396_color=BLK&amp;cgid=socks-underwear#tile-7=&amp;start=1&amp;sz=24">Patagonia briefs</a> were alright. I feel like I’ll be on the hunt indefinitely, but maybe a few pairs of one of these will do if for you. All three are comfortable, and dry fast, but the Knix and Patagonia pairs are better for sweaty hikes as the MeUndies tend to get a little swamped.</p><p>Three pairs of underwear might seem like too few, and feel free to adjust as necessary, but by and large: one to wear, one to wash, one that’s dry. This motto means you’re almost always set for two days, and worst case, you can dry a pair on the outside of your bag while hiking. The Knix and Patagonia briefs dry in only a few hours, so you could wash before breakfast, and come back, coffee in hand to some clean drawers.</p><p>For bras, I stick to sports bras from Pact or Calvin Klein. I hate underwrites, and sports bras last a lot longer between washes.</p><h2 id="jacket-a-namejacketa">Jacket</h2><p>Your mileage may vary heavily on style and need for this category, but my go-tos always include the<a href="https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-torre-womens-high-performance-windpro-hoodie-jacket">Torre Wind Pro</a>. I recently bought a second one of these, and even though I think Mission Workshop is getting rid of their women’s line (boo hiss), this is an incredible hoodie. It is DWR coated so light rain just falls off, and also fleece-lined so by itself I can handle temperatures down to 8c/46f. Colder or wetter, and I bring an overcoat. The two coats in my rotation right now are the<a href="https://www.arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/codetta-coat">Arcteryx Codetta</a> and the<a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/jk-18au004-fr-rain-trench?variant=13074792972386">Snow Peak FR Rain Trench</a> (which is also<em>fireproof</em>?!). Good layering means even at freezing temperatures, I do well. If it was super cold, I’d probably include a wool sweater to wear under or over my hoodie, and I’d throw my leggings on under my pants.</p><h2 id="shoes-and-socks-a-nameshoesa">Shoes and socks</h2><p><a href="https://bombas.com/products/women-s-solid-invisibles-tan-small?variant=black">Bombas</a> or Darn Tough are the way to go for socks. Most of the time it’s not cold enough to wear longer socks, so I wear no-shows or ankle socks. Wool means these also wick well, and wash easily—depending on your food funk, a couple days is usually fine between washes.</p><p>If it’s cold or wet, I’m wearing<a href="https://www.blundstone.com/shop/black-premium-leather-chelsea-boots-womens-style-558">Blundstones</a>, or<a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/M20327.html">Stan Smiths</a>. Summer means something light and knit like<a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-sock-primeknit-shoes/CQ2218.html">these Sambas</a>. Lightweight, comfortable, and breathable means you only need one pair of shoes. If they’re black, even sneakers work in many slightly fancy situations. In my opinion, sandals should only show up in a public shower, or on the beach, so I never bring any.</p><h2 id="hat">Hat</h2><p>A wool beanie is great for warmth, so I wear<a href="https://www.tannergoods.com/products/merino-watch-cap">this one from Tanner Goods</a>. It’s expensive, but it holds up.</p><h2 id="plan-ahead">Plan ahead</h2><p>All of my clothing works well for me, but I typically go to Europe or Japan. If you go somewhere much hotter or much colder, you’ll definitely need to adjust, especially if you go from a freezing spot to a hot one. If you end up bringing a lot of stuff for one leg of a trip, you can always mail stuff home too. Layering is your friend. There’re a lot of<a href="https://www.carryology.com/travel/how-what-to-put-in-your-minimalist-travel-capsule-wardrobe/">lists for women</a> that have much more feminine clothing, but that’s not really my jam. For me, functional > cute any day of the week. But, regardless of your style choice, stretchy, lightweight clothing is the way to go.</p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Travel kit update</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-13-travel-kit-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-13-travel-kit-update/</guid><description>Since 2019, I updated my kit a little bit, but mostly it stayed the same.
One old bag, one new My Ryu Quickpack was a delight once-again, as I used it to transport all my gear to Japan, and then from city to city. Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I&amp;rsquo;ve owned, but due to its size, I don&amp;rsquo;t like hauling it around all day.</description><content:encoded><p>Since 2019, I updated my kit a<a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1100823338497105921">little bit</a>, but mostly it stayed the same.</p><h2 id="one-old-bag-one-new">One old bag, one new</h2><p>My Ryu Quickpack was a delight once-again, as I used it to transport all my gear to Japan, and then from city to city. Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I&rsquo;ve owned, but due to its size, I don&rsquo;t like hauling it around all day. I hoped that the DSPTCH bag would work really well during day to day travel, and it probably would have if it hadn&rsquo;t rained every day. The waist bag isn&rsquo;t waterproof (boo), or particularly comfortable for long stretches (double boo), due to the one shoulder setup. I wear the Waist Bag to work almost every day, but for way less time, so I&rsquo;d forgotten how little continual stress my left shoulder can take. Also, I learned that with<a href="https://www.arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/codetta-coat">my rain coat</a> on, the bag slides up uncomfortably against my neck, so next time I&rsquo;ll need a day backpack again. Most days, I chose not to bring a bag to avoid this discomfort. I hauled my LAMY Safari pen + a<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Hobonichi-Techo-Weeks/ct/4399">Hobonichi Weeks</a>, my phone, and some tissue paper, so a bag was overkill mostly.</p><h2 id="two-jackets">Two jackets</h2><p>I took my Arcteryx coat to Japan, and it served me well, despite being a<em>little</em> tight. However, I wandered into a Snow Peak store early in the trip, and my friend Sarah and the shopkeeper convinced me to try on a steeply discounted<a href="https://snowpeak.com/collections/outerwear-1/products/jk-18au004-fr-rain-trench?variant=13074792972386">Japanese XL<em>fire resistant</em> jacket</a>. It fit like a charm, and was long enough to easily cover my knees so I could stay warm and dry in the constant rain. I alternated between the two coats through the rest of the wet trip, but with both in my RYU bag, there wasn&rsquo;t much room for other stuff. I never plan on buying much in Japan, and certainly not clothes, so this was a pleasant surprise. As a back-up, I had a packable Baggu tote, but I never had to resort to carrying stuff in the tote on the way home. If I were traveling to a rainy area again, I&rsquo;d only bring one coat, and which one would depend on how much layering I needed to do. It&rsquo;s kinda nice to have options.</p><h2 id="just-enough-space">Just enough space</h2><p>By the end of my trip the RYU bag was a<em>tight</em> zip. I bought two manga tankoban, and one Japanese novel, as well as a series of gachapon souvenirs,<a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2015/05/japanese-lucky-charms-the-guide-to-omamori/">omamori</a>, and a load of Vick&rsquo;s lozenges because of my cold. Everything fit, along with my two jackets, but only<em>just</em> so. I wore my DSPTCH bag on the front, outside of the RYU to get on the plane or train, but I could stuff it in if I needed to.</p><h2 id="planned-changes">Planned changes</h2><p>Next trip, if the weather is similar, my plan is to bring one jacket, and not buy another. Additionally, two pairs of pants was really beneficial, but<a href="http://www.coalatree.com/collections/kachula/products/trailhead-adventure-pant">a new pair I bought</a> should pack better than<a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nike-nikelab-x-mmw-womens-pants/4796841">the Nike pants</a> I brought, so that will save some space. My<a href="http://www.goby.co/products/electric-toothbrush-all-black">new toothbrush</a> worked swimmingly, and I didn&rsquo;t bring a charger, since my trip was ~2 weeks. I brought just enough toiletries, and that felt nice. I wish I&rsquo;d brought a tank top to sleep in, as I only had two shirts, so I felt like one was always a little funky from sleep, but because they wick, it was alright. For a daypack, I might look for an ultralight packable daypack, like one from Matador or<a href="http://www.ynotmade.com/en/shop/splitshift/?sku=5808">YNOT</a>, but my Topo Designs bag is probably good enough.</p><h2 id="next-trip">Next trip</h2><p>Next time I fly, it’s a short trip to Portland for a conference I’m doing a talk at with some friends. Two days means I’ll bring my Oppose This bag, and have a chill, easy time. Hopefully I’ll get to go back to Japan later this year and test this whole load-out again.</p></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
