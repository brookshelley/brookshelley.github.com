Plenty of time to read, watch movies, and play Civ 6 (and keep losing). I also picked-up Gran Turismo and raced virtual cars for countless hours. This month felt like a year.
Books Polaris Rising — Jessie Mihalik
A mix of space caper and Harlequin Romance, there was entirely too much straight sex in this for me. But, if you think “space operas should have more picking out dresses and rough hands on waists,” then this is the book for you.</description></item><item><title>March</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-31-march/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-31-march/</guid><description>Books Empress of Forever — Max Gladstone
A fun space romp with a Jobsian lesbian protagonist and a strange cast of characters. This quickly shifts into a very different book from what it starts as, but I still loved it. More space lesbians, please.
A Song for a New Day — Sarah Pinsker
Welp, my second book for the month was another plague book, albeit one that largely took place in the aftermath of a pox.</description></item><item><title>January</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-30-media-diet-for-january/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-30-media-diet-for-january/</guid><description>2020 began in earnest, and despite it being winter, in the Bay Area it’s delightfully sunny. I spent the first week largely sitting by the window of my apartment, reading and studying Japanese. So far, I really enjoy the slower pace of this decade.
Books Mainline — Deborah Christiansen
A fun throwback to the world of cyber decks and assassins. I wish I’d found this in 1996, but it holds up well.</description></item><item><title>December</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-31-media-diet-for-december/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-31-media-diet-for-december/</guid><description>Books Dept. of Speculation — Jenny Offill
A gorgeous and sad book that captures long relationships so well. I loved for narrator and the strange poetic style of storytelling. I read this in two sittings and was enraptured.
Dead Astronauts — Jeff Vandermeer
This book did some interesting things with time, and some deeply annoying things with text. I feel like I know what he was doing with this book largely, and support his environmental aims (a+ murderous blue fox), but it never really came together for me.</description></item><item><title>November</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-30-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-30-media-diet/</guid><description>It’s finally chilly hygge-weather in the Bay Area, so I’ve been reading a lot after returning from a long trip to Japan. I hope wherever you are, you’re warm and feel loved.
Books The Starless Sea &amp;ndash; Erin Morgenstern
I read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea.</description></item><item><title>October</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-10-31-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-10-31-media-diet/</guid><description>Books To Be Taught, If Fortunate — Becky Chambers
This is one of the best sci-fi short novellas I’ve read in a while. It’s not quite hard SF, but I love all the little details. The characters are great, and just casually queer, and there’s just enough suspense to make it a real page-turner. A triumph.
The Guest Cat — Takashi Hiraide **
Definitely cried reading this one. I’m a sucker for Japanese cat literature for sure.</description></item><item><title>September</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-09-30-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-09-30-media-diet/</guid><description>Media diet for September Books Gideon the Ninth — Tamsyn Muir
Queer space necromancers! Queer space necromancers! OMG. This book was utterly bizarre, and a hell of a lot of fun. I’m a fan of low-tech future space stories, where for the most part the book seems more like fantasy than sci-fi, so this book was a joy. Plus there was necromancy! Apparently there are going to be two more books in this series, which is a delightful thing to learn, because I want to stretch out and learn more about this strange universe.</description></item><item><title>August</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-08-30-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-08-30-media-diet/</guid><description>Books The Light Brigade — Kameron Hurley
Definite Catch-22 vibes throughout this book, with a hearty helping of Starship Troopers. If you like time-travel and space military, this is a solid read.
The Psychology of Time Travel — Kate Mascarenhas
Ah, time-travel and lesbians: two of my favorite things. This book was an interesting take on time-travel, and inevitable meeting of your future and past selves. I really enjoyed the small strange moments between characters.</description></item><item><title>July</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-07-25-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-07-25-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Dune — Frank Herbert
A classic. I read this when I was a kid, but hadn’t reread it since then. It’s weird, long, and great. The rest of the series is supposed to be bizarre, so I can’t wait. The spice must flow.
Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead — Sara Gran
An alright mystery book, but more than a few times, I think the author attempted to add grit but just ended up sounding like a very awkward narrator.</description></item><item><title>June</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-30-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-30-media-diet/</guid><description>Books The Fated Sky — Mary Robinette Kowal
More cool space stuff! I enjoyed the pacing more in this book, and despite the frustration with very 50s attitudes that still pervade the modern world, I enjoyed journeying with these two books to mars.
The Bone Clocks — David Mitchell
A delightful collision of strange characters across time. This book is just fantastical enough to scratch my sci-fi itch, and literary enough to keep me satisfied.</description></item><item><title>May</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-24-media-diet/</guid><description>This was a really great month for books largely because I got really into the Themis Files series. Price’s book on breaking up with your phone also encouraged me to pick up my Kindle more than I refreshed Twitter, and honestly, so far that’s been a positive experience.
Books Noumenon — Marina J. Lostetter
Ah! Another great multi-generational space exploration story. I don&amp;rsquo;t really get why so many sci-fi books are doing this sort of thing lately, but I&amp;rsquo;m into it.</description></item><item><title>April</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-04-27-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-04-27-media-diet/</guid><description>Books The United States of Japan — Peter Tieryas
An alternate history where Japan and Germany won WW2, then proceeded to divvy up North America. Most of the book is set in the 80s, in a world of internet devices, and giant robots, ruled by the Japanese emperor. It&amp;rsquo;s a brutal story at times, but was generally interesting and a good sci-fi time.
If Cats Disappeared from the World — Genki Kawarmura **</description></item><item><title>March</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books The City in the Middle of the Night — Charlie Jane Anders
A fantastic book about humankind settling on a tidally-locked planet, but instead of seeing how we cope, we learn the stories of their descendants, hundreds of years after our first tentative steps. The light is too bright and hot, and the night too cold and dark. We live on the edge in an eternal dusk/morning light. The two protagonists, Mouth, and Sophie, are on the edges of society, yearning for things they&amp;rsquo;ve lost or can&amp;rsquo;t have, and all that leads towards.</description></item><item><title>February</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Genocidal Organ — Project Itoh
A truly grim thriller about the cost of “fighting terrorism,” and the ability of language to tear apart a country. This feels eerily prescient. I can’t say I enjoyed reading this book, but it’s a nihilistic political commentary that at least adds some color to what politicians might be after when they start wars and conflicts. This book is graphic, violent, and in its way, poignant.</description></item><item><title>January</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-01-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-01-24-media-diet/</guid><description>It’s a new year! Time to watch even more shows and movies, and with the rise of bingeable 10 hour TV movies, I have found myself watching fewer of the 90-120 minute variety. With Criteron launching a movie service, maybe that’ll change.
Books The Masked City — Genevieve Cogman
Another romp through alternate worlds with the rebellious librarian Irene, and her Sherlock stand-in pal Vale. The world of this book is largely a strange version of Venice, but more than the first book, other world’s tech is sprinkled throughout.</description></item><item><title>December</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-20-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-20-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Provenance — Ann Leckie
A different planet and culture than the Raadchai from her trilogy, but a very compelling story. I got very confused for a while about who was who, but eventually I sorted it out.
The Dark Archive — Victoria Schwab **
A fun, strange YA book about what happens after death, and the teens who defend the afterlife. There were some cool twists, and story details throughout, but the world building could have been better.</description></item><item><title>November</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-20-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-20-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Circe &amp;ndash; Madeline Miller
This book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Odyssey, this is a must read.
Red Clocks &amp;ndash; Leni Zumas
A bit too close to our dystopian reality for my liking, but this was well-written, and full of strong and interesting women.</description></item><item><title>October</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-30-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-30-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Sympathy — Olivia Sudjic *
Wow, I loved this book. A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It&amp;rsquo;s also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.</description></item><item><title>September</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-09-25-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-09-25-media-diet/</guid><description>Books State Tectonics — Malka Older
A fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn&amp;rsquo;t love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.</description></item><item><title>August</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-08-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-08-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Fingersmith — Sarah Waters
In an odd turn of fate, I&amp;rsquo;d seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that&amp;rsquo;s likely because I devoted little time to reading.</description></item><item><title>July</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-07-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-07-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Adventure Zone: There Be Gerblins
A masterful adaptation of the podcast D&amp;amp;D romp into a graphic novel. I absolutely loved this. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t listened to the podcast, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, get on it&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s free and it&amp;rsquo;s delightful.
La Bastarda — Trifonia Melibea Obono *
A lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself falling for another woman.</description></item><item><title>June</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-06-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-06-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Swearing Off Stars — Danielle Wong
Started off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t really be with you until it&amp;rsquo;s too late&amp;rdquo; lesbian novel. I also kept thinking an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was an odd read, and the time-jumps didn&amp;rsquo;t help. If you can write a lesbian romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying?</description></item><item><title>May</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-05-24-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-05-24-media-diet/</guid><description>Books Lab Rat One — Andrea Höst
Ok, this series is exceedingly straight, and that&amp;rsquo;s a bummer. I wish there was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten slightly sick of the cycles of &amp;ldquo;power then injury&amp;rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to finish this out.
Caszandra — Andrea Höst</description></item><item><title>April</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-04-17-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-04-17-media-diet/</guid><description>Books All Systems Red — Martha Wells
Pretty fun book about a &amp;ldquo;murderbot&amp;rdquo; who would rather be watching tv dramas than shooting anything. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next few books.
Stray — Andrea Höst
This was recommended to me by my buddy Nick, and I&amp;rsquo;d avoided it for unknown reasons. Maybe the cover was too low-budget? But, this book is really fun. I think this series kinda qualifies as YA, but the journal nature, as well as the mystery of scifi tech/magic systems got me deep into the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
