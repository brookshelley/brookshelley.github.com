As my clothes gradually wear out, I’m slowly trying to replace everything with my current favorites. This makes for a very simple wardrobe that works for all 4 seasons. 

Lots of this stuff is wool, all of it is pretty durable, and when possible I tried to find vendors that were environmentally friendly and smaller. 

## Shirts

[4 tank tops](https://ryu.com/shop/us/women/tops/standard-issue-racerback-tank) — These are fantastic tank tops. They wick well, don’t get stinky, and look good enough to wear outside of the gym.

[4 t-Shirts](https://jungmaven.com/collections/hemp-shirts-womens-tees-tanks/products/hemp-shirt-ojai-tee-short-sleeve-womens) — Comfy, and cool looking. There’re a lot of colors if you don’t want to wear all black all the time.

2 tailored dress shirts (long sleeve)

## Pants

[3 pants](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/rectrek-pant?variant=34894691781&size=1) — I just keep buying these. They’re comfortable, stretch well during activity, and hold up to a lot of punishment.

## Shorts

[2 pairs of shorts](https://ryu.com/shop/us/women-all/shorts/power-short) — Great for lifting weights, yoga, or just when it’s hot. I wouldn’t wear them to work, but I wouldn’t wear shorts to work generally.

## Leggings

[2 pairs of leggings](https://ryu.com/shop/us/women/bottoms/cardio-tights) — These stay up during yoga and powerlifting really well. They’re comfortable and keep you dry even if you go out for a drink after working out.

## Underwear

[10 pairs of underwear](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-underwear/siren-hipkini/104704.html) — Wool underwear rules.

[5 sports bras](https://www.calvinklein.us/en/womens-clothing/womens-bras/custom-modern-cotton-bralette-52705992) — I keep trying to find something that’s more comfortable, but I keep coming back to these. Simple, and easy.

## Socks

[8 pairs of socks](https://bombas.com/products/womens-no-shows-one-color-eight-pack?variant=black) — Great wool socks that pack light and dry quickly.

## Pajamas

[3 Shorts with pockets](https://www.foxers.com/black-tomboy-boxer-brief/) — I love that i can throw a phone or keys in here and check the mail if I’m too lazy to put on pants.

## Sweater

[1 sweater](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-sweaters/waypoint-crewe-sweater/104316.html?dwvar_104316_color=401) — You never know when you need a nice sweater.

## Jacket

[Hoodie](https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-torre-womens-high-performance-windpro-hoodie-jacket) — Great hoodie. I own two because I think they’re discontinuing them sadly. My backup is probably a Chrome one, I guess.

## Rain coat

[Coat](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/andra-coat) — Very low-key and stealth. This jacket looks just as good in the city as it does on a hike.
