It’s official: I’ve joined the newsletter trend in earnest. I’ve had [a newsletter](https://dillandfennel.substack.com) for a few months now, but I wasn’t sure what to really _do_ with it. Fortunately, I realized what I love to see the most from some of my [favorite](https://craigmod.com/roden/) [newsletters](https://desert.glass) is links to what these authors are reading this week—little jewels from internet wanderings. 

My re-launched Dill and Fennel newsletter will have links to some of the more interesting or funny things I’ve seen in the previous week. Sometimes these may be links to books, or tweets with a little color commentary. If you read this site, you might enjoy [subscribing](https://dillandfennel.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fdillandfennel.substack.com%2F).

I’ll still write here as often as I can, but I found myself wanting a quicker way to write weekly, without needing a _big_ thing to blog about, or something to review. My monthly media diets will still be posted to brookshelley.com as well. It’s been fun to do tiny reviews of books and movies, even if it’s mostly for my own memory of what I consumed in a year. Not using Letterboxed or Goodreads for this was a very conscious decision—I want to own and control my own data. If you keep track of this kind of stuff yourself, or run your own little slice of the internet, I’d love to [hear about it](mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com)!
