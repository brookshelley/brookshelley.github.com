# XOXO 2018 Monday Thoughts

In my [previous post](https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/09/05/3rd-xoxo-and-anniversary.html), I talked about anticipating XOXO 2018, which ended last night. Today, I am tired, happy, and trying to remember what to do for work when I'm not awkwardly wandering around a stadium full of 2000+ people.

## So. Many. People.

This year I was overwhelmed by the size of XOXO in ways I hadn't been in the past. To be fair, two years ago I was only a year into working from home, whereas now I'm 3 years a hermit, but still, 2000 people is a _lot_. It felt like 100-200 people were folks I either knew from Twitter, friends, or Slack, and the "should I wave or say hi?" feeling that keeps me from going to parties was _hugely_ amplified here. Fortunately, there were good talks, and things that weren't socially awkward to attend. Also, as always, having a friend or two around is a good salve fo my anxiety, and leaving the venue often to eat was vital.

## Cool stuff.

The games were neat. I only played Plunge, but watching Neo Cab, and untitled goose game was fun. Also, Laura Hall's very good ARG was silly good, with a chill payoff at the end. I felt lucky to do it early, before the 60+ person line after the Andys announced its existence on stage. Open Mike Eagle, Demi, and Janelle Shane gave particularly fun talks. I often felt like the bird in a psychological experiment that dies between two equidistant food bowls, but often just gave-in and stayed at the same thing for a while to avoid zipping to-and-fro.

The friends I caught up with were a huge highlight, especially folks I got to eat with and wander around with. It's really helpful to have a small crew that are a known quantity, so when I was out of energy, I knew what to expect. I hosted two friends this time as well, and coming home with them was like returning home with some family. I made the choice more than once to eschew an activity for some time with a few people, and that felt very rewarding.

## Next year

- I hope the size of XOXO goes down again next year.
  If this means more sponsorship, community funding, and other methods for a quarter -> half of the attendees to not pay for a ticket.

- I also hope that there is a little less parallel programming that isn't recorded.
  Needing to use the restroom, take a break, or eat food often felt like a frustrating trade-off with wanting to see a friend talk or perform.

- Karaoke was good, but the very talented musicians who performed drastically altered the room.
  Next year, more than one karaoke room could be rad.

- I loved the free soda, but paid alcohol system, especially because it discouraged heavy drinking, I think.

- The bathrooms were about what I expected for a stadium, but I hope next year they're a little less brutalist/low-ceilinged.

- I don't know if Revolution Hall is a better venue, but I definitely missed the outside yard area, because grass fields are nicer than concrete pavilions.

Ultimately, I don't envy the Andys any of the planning, listening, or responding they've spent years doing, and think they've put together an extremely good, complicated event. I will probably try to attend again in 2019, circumstances permitting. Community is hard. I think it's worth it.
