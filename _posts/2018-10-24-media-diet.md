# Media diet for September 2018

## Books

**Love & Estrogen** -- Samantha Allen

I don't usually read trans memoir--and I have a forthcoming piece that challenges and lampoons it to a degree--but Samantha is a friend and her story is close to my heart because of that. I had the chance to chat with her a lot through the course of part of this love and transition story, and I enjoyed the way she told it. This memoir definitely touched on some of the tropes of the genre, but by also being a wonderful love story, it manages to eschew many more.

**The Tea Master & the Detective** -- Aliette de Bodard [**](#ghost)

This was a fun detective tale with a mysterious Sherlock and a spaceship Watson. The setup never quite paid off with its mystery, but I look forward to reading more hooks in the series. I also worried a bit that it would fetishize or exoticize Chinese culture, but outside of the space-protection tea, it largely doesn't come up.

## Movies

**Dawn of the Dead** (2004/Rewatch)

I could watch this every year. This is an excellent remake of an excellent zombie film. Everyone gives their all, and so many of the deaths, kills, and twists are perfect. A+ work from before Zach Snyder made cruddy films.
