## Books

**This is How You Lose the Time War** -- Amal el-Mohtar and Max Gladstone

A deeply strange time-travel romance between two competing spies, Blue and Red. The central conceit of shifting threads of history and letter-leaving was fun, but at times I honestly had no idea what was going on. I really enjoyed this book.

## Movies

**Ready or Not**

Lol can't wait to never get remarried. Rich people are the worst. Also it's a real bummer that "satanists" get such a bad wrap in a world where the christians are the ones actually harming children. Fuck the [satanic panic](https://overcast.fm/+VX6lxzezs)
