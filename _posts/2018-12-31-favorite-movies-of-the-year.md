# Favorite Movies of 2018

This year started off with one of the goofiest movies I’d see all year: Murder on the Orient Express. I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:

**Hunt for the Wilderpeople** 

This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight. Family, rebellion, loss... ugh, I want to rewatch this right now.

**Black Panther**

Can you believe this came out in 2018? I got to see it in Oakland, and the crowd was dressed to the nines, and stoked AF about it. I saw Black Panther twice, and it’s the first super hero film in a while that made me smile and cheer throughout.

**Annihilation**

I loved this movie, for all that it didn’t hew to the book, and was bizarre. I’d loved the trilogy when I read it, but also enjoy Alex Garland’s films generally. I can’t say _why_ I love this movie, but I do, and I saw it more than once.

**Sorry to Bother You**

I can’t say much about this indictment of capitalism and the gig-economy without spoiling it, but it’s excellent and you should go see it.

**Widows**

This movie felt like a dunk on the lackluster Oceans 8, and had everything I could want. The stakes were high, and even if it wasn’t the best at sustaining mystery, every woman in this film was outstanding.

**The Favourite**

Outstanding lesbian film. The humor in this movie was truly strange, and joyful. I feel like The Favourite came out of nowhere and blew me away, and except for a minor amount of rabbit-based fear, I was all the way here for it.
