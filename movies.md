# movies i've watched

## 2017

_this list is super truncated because i forgot keep it until July_

1. **Alien Covenant**

    Aliens rule. This movie ruled. Kenny Powers flies a spaceship, and new Ridley is solid. Also Magneto is creepy AF in this.

2. **Logan**

    It's like Wolverine, but better, because he's old. Also this has Rictor, who was gay in the comics with Shatterstar. Super entertaining.

3. **Fast & Furious 8**

    Haven't seen one of these? Ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a time? Start at 1, then watch 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8. I think. Anyways, this is bonkers in a perfect way.

4. **The Autopsy of Jane Doe**

    Brian Cox from that other X-Men movie and also Rushmore is a morgue-guy, like those cuties from Six Feet Under... except spookier. Also I think the other guy was Spiderman.

5. **Lego Batman**

    Gob Bluth is the bat. This movie is hilarious. Bonus points if you're a DC comics nerd, or just enjoy fun.
