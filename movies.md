# movies i've watched

## 2017

_this list is super truncated because i forgot keep it until july_

1. **Life**

    Everyone forgets their training, acts like an ass, and gets munched by
    aliens. It was entertaining in a schadenfreude way.

2. **Moonlight**

    Cried through most of this. It's about growing up black & gay, with a
    neurodiverse mom. It's beautiful, intense, and in my top five movies I've
    ever seen. Incredible.

3. **Get Out**

    At times hilarious, and others biting AF. I really loved this movie. A
    pitch-perfect callout of "good white folks", like we often are.

2. **Alien Covenant**

    Aliens rule. This movie ruled. Kenny Powers flies a spaceship, and new
    Ridley is solid. Also Magneto is creepy AF in this.

3. **Logan**

    It's like Wolverine, but better, because he's old. Also this has Rictor,
    who was gay in the comics with Shatterstar. Super entertaining.

4. **Fast & Furious 8**

    Haven't seen one of these? Ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a
    time? Start at 1, then watch 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8. I think. Anyways, this is
    bonkers in a perfect way.

5. **Blame!**

    A anime movie? Yea, this series by Nihei is kinda rad, and there's cool
    killer lady. It's 3D animated, which is kinda the worst, but it doesn't
    look horrible in this.

6. **Rogue One**

    Ah, this was super good. A+ characters, fun action, and a lack of space
    incest! Also the robot was comic relief without being a jar jar.

7. **The Autopsy of Jane Doe**

    Brian Cox from that other X-Men movie and also Rushmore is a morgue-guy,
    like those cuties from Six Feet Under... except spookier. Also I think the
    other guy was Spiderman.

8. **Lego Batman**

    Gob Bluth is the bat. This movie is hilarious. Bonus points if you're a DC
    comics nerd, or just enjoy fun.

9. **Train to Busan**

    Seriously one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time. Also I
    love trains, and this is the best train movie since Snowpiercer.

10. **Aliens**

    Ugh, this sequel to Alien was so good, and still is so good. RIP cool cat,
    but yay for all the rad ladies in this. Also Bishop is the only ok robot in
    this series.

11. **Guardians of the Galaxy 2**

    Overall, pretty entertaining. Gomorra is cool as always. Baby Groot was
    less awful than I expected, and hey! Kurt Russell space dad.

12. **John Wick 2**

    So, this is more Keanu as a veneful Denzel Washington-esque character, but
    not as good. I liked this movie, but also Man on Fire did it better. Well
    shot though! And there's at least a nod towards ammo being a thing.

13. **Kong: Skull Island**

    Wow, they just told Samuel L. Jackson to be his one character, which is a
    great character. Bonus points for Steve Brule.

14. **Tremors**

    "Featuring Kevin Bacon from Footloose" as the least convincing outdoor
    working man in a movie, ever. He and his boyfriend can't leave town, so
    they end up fighting giant worms. This movie is super euphemistic,
    hilarious, and the best role Reba has ever had.

15. **Shin Godzilla**

    A fantastic look at how modern bueracracy and posturing can get in the way
    of stopping a giant lizard. Too bad they don't show the environmental
    devastation wrought by eschewing safety checks.

16. **Your Name**

    A super cute, super straight story of love through time. Imagine if the
    Lake House was better, and didn't have Keanu. It's basically this.

17. **The Girl with All the Gifts**

    Another great zombie movie, with a super cute protagonist. Cute kid zombies
    are great.

18. **Raw**

    This is literally what happens if you break vegan.

19. **Prometheus**

    Had to rewatch this after Covenant. Still perfect. Naomi Rapace could do
    her taxes on film, and I'd probably be riveted. She rules.

20. **Justice League Dark**

    I wanted this to be better. It was so-so, and seriously, _Swamp Thing_?

21. **The Heat**

    A send-up of Lethal Weapon + every buddy cop film. Mcarthy and Bullock are
    fantastic in this.

22. **Keanu**

    I will watch this yearly, as it's one of the 4 movies I own. Get high, and
    watch this movie about a kitten, and the men who love him.

23. **Wicker Man**

    Nick Cage at his most unhinged. Well, close to it. My roommate hadn't seen
    this, so I introduced her to this hilarious hellride.

24. **Neon Demon**

    Don't get into modelling. It'll end badly. This movie was beautiful, gory,
    and wild.

25. **Kubo**

    I've enjoyed other movies from this studio more – Coraline for one – but
    this was still fun.

26. **Baby Driver**

    I'd avoided watching this because I hadn't read great things about it, save for [this review by Matt Haughey](https://15minutes.inthemorni.ng/baby-driver-was-fantastic-2acd21be54ba). While I agree with him that the opening action scene was stellar, so
    were the short films BMW made with greats like Wong Kar Wai a few years ago
    to sell cars. I liked watching this film, but it's unfortunate that the men
    were two-dimensional, and the women collapsed in on themselves, with no
    characterization, or much motivation. I'd expected a bit more of Edgar
    Wright, but on the upside, the musical cues were also quite good. I'm not
    fully sure if this is a tribute to old McQueen movies, or what, but it was
    alright, but I can't co-sign the _fantastic_ from the above. It was
    exciting, but the stakes weren't ever high, because I never cared much
    about the protagonist, because I was given no reason to care. We've seen
    chases before, parkour, car work. This movie could've elevated them
    further, but it chose not to. I never believed there really was jeopardy,
    because as the movie, and the news of the day makes clear, "he's such a
    good boy," is something that will always apply to the white male criminal.

27. **Valerian**

    The short version is that this was very targetted towards a Chinese release, partially due to the studio financing, and even Besson was [promoting it on Weibo](http://chinafilminsider.com/valerian-city-thousand-planets-passes-china-censorship/). I had a great time watching this movie, but it was pretty
    dang ridiculous, and had super traditional and boring gender roles and
    "marriage is the best" kind of crap. Still, the visuals were incredible,
    and it was a fun space romp. Recommended.

28. **Secret Life of Pets**

    I blame my friend Andy – they wanted to watch this because they were tired
    and we thought it'd be cute. It was very cute, but also pretty silly. I
    dunno. Kids probably loved it. There's some good cats.

29. **Atomic Blonde**

    Charlize Theron as a queer badass assassin/spy? Sold. Because this is
    mainstream Hollywood, of course that doesn't last, but still... this was a
    fun romp. A summer movie devoid of substance, but thick and heavy with
    style and silliness.

30. **Flatliners**

    Kiefer oozes weird attraction in this classic about chasing the meaning of
    life by dying for minutes. I saw a trailer for the _sequel_ to this, I
    guess, with Ellen Page, so I had to revisit the original. I loved it all
    over again. Spooky and silly. And, to quote my roommate, "how many Baldwins
    are there?!"

31. **They're Watching**

    This was goofy as hell, and was sort of a comedic Blair Witch in Moldova
    thing. Near the end it takes a sharp left, and we were cracking up. Worth
    watching on Netflix, perhaps?

32. **2012**

    A beautifully terrible film by the guy who brought us
    The Day After Tomorrow. I love a movie where we're led to believe that John
    Cusack is the best driver in the world, and a writer-cum-action hero. I
    love watching this movie when I'm camping, or hiking for a few days,
    because it's so ridiculous, and also it's wild to watch the world end,
    however silly the movie.

33. **In This Corner of the World**

    SO. MANY. TEARS. My friends and I sobbed through a lot of this film about
    the atrocities of World War 2, especially the destruction the United States
    caused in Japan. The movie follows a woman living in Hiroshima, then Kure,
    who grows up in the 30s and 40s, and sees her friends and loved ones suffer
    during the war. It's beautiful, hilarious at times, and sad. This movie is
    a shift on the view that Grave of the Fireflies offers, but definitely in
    similar territory.

34. **The Visit**

    Guessed the twist about 20 minutes into this movie and i'm really proud of
    that because I'm usually the worst at figuring out where bad movies are
    headed. Don't trust your grandparents. Don't send your kids anywhere. Don't
    ever clean your oven.

35. **The Conjuring**

    This was great, until the witch didn't win. I can't help but think these
    movies are trying to get me to follow their lord and savior.

36. **The Conjuring 2**

    Yep, these are definitely witnessing. A cool demon has a hard time with
    some very awful british people. Watched both of these in quick succession
    to get to see Annabelle 2 or whatever later on tonight.

37. **Annabelle: Creation**

    This was a very silly movie with children making terrible choices. I don't
    think dolls themselves are very scary, but Catholocism is definitely scary.
    Everyone who gets hunted by the demon or whatever was also a practicing
    Catholic, so maybe being a satanist or atheist would be some kinda ghost
    protection.

38. **Wall-E**

    One of the best movies ever, and it's held up super well in animation and
    craft. I love this robot.

39. **I think I watched a movie about a plague**

    I was on a LOT of drugs for surgery, so I have no idea what this was
    called, but I'm pretty sure I saw it before?

40. **The Happening**

    This fucking movie is straight-up incredible. Mark Wahlberg at his best
    "I'm just happy to be here," and a whole lot of incredibly banal deaths.
    Zooey "Literal Beige Person" Deschanel is also in this for some reason.
    Anyways, I love that this was one of the movies we all saw, hoping for the
    return of that GOOD GOOD Sixth Sense action, and instead we got this
    beautiful god trash. Eat a pound of desert pudding and cry about humanity.
    "I'm gonna give you... a math riddle."

41. **IT**

    Hadn't seen it, and wow what a silly joy. Not scary at all, but I'm
    definitely even less trustworthy of Tim Curry now, I guess? Everyone is
    giving their all in this movie.

42. **Wonder Woman**

    Ok, I finally saw it. I literally couldn't stop thinking about Gal being
    part of an anti-Palestian army, but once Chris Pine made me laugh by doing
    a bad German accent. This movie bravely asks the question: "she's a
    goddess, but when will she become super saiyan?" Not particularly into this
    movie.

43. **Spiderman: Homecoming**

    This is the kind of superhero film that makes me smile. I think this is the
    best reboot of the Spiderman franchise, and it is filled with silly, fun
    moments, that emphasize the more joyful aspects of the character. I'm
    looking forward to the next few. Marvel seems like they're just going to
    keep making better movies than DC, save for the Nolan Batman movies.
    Speaking of Batman – the second best modern Batman (Michael Keaton) also
    plays the Vulture in this movie. Go figure. Anyways, this was a fun romp.

44. **Ingrid Goes West**

    Everyone besides Dan is terrible in this movie, and Dan is hella
    co-dependent. This is a biting satire of the lives folks live in pursuit of
    Instagram perfection. #blessed #wow_millenials #the_other_olsen

45. **Death Becomes Her**

    Bruce Willis, with _hair_! Wow. Everything about this movie is perfect.
    Women seeking eternal youth. Isabella Rossilini just oozing charisma and
    power. Inexplicable wrestling manservants. Mincing Bruce Willis. The
    prothesis in this movie is _hella_ Beetlejuice. I loved it.

46. **New IT**

    I think I'm broken inside, because jump scares and all of the "scary" bits
    of this film didn't phase me. It was at times pretty cute, but the misogyny
    and against the only girl in the group was the scariest thing of all. I'm
    interested to see what they do with the second part of this movie. The
    visuals were kinda neat and well-done.

47. **Friend Request**

    Wow, this movie was garbage. I ended up skipping through it because the
    first 20 minutes were so painful. 0 thumbs out of 20.

48. **The Hitman's Bodyguard**

    Samuel L Jackson at 68 in The Hitman's Bodyguard is doing a better job than
    most action guys half his age. What a goofy, fun movie. It's not
    particularly smart, but it was a wonderful romp. A summer action movie
    through and through.

49. **Ghost in the Shell (with ScarJo & white-washing)**

    The fashion was kinda neat, and some of the visuals were cool. The story
    seemed worse than the anime though, and I can't tell if ScarJo can't act,
    or just collected a paycheck. Bonus points to Beat Takeshi for just
    speaking Japanese the entire time, unlike the rest of the characters. He's
    great. I hope he got paid for this trash.

50. **xXx: The Return of Xander Cage**

    Wow, this movie was over-the-top ridiculous. And the terrible coat was back
    from the first movie. I think this canonically takes place in the Marvel
    universe, because of Samuel L. Jackson. I have no idea why xXx uses
    "extreme sports" people, soccer stars, and a DJ(?), but here we are. I love
    this very, very goofy series, and bought this movie with a big grin when it
    was no longer available for rent. Everyone is having a blast, and it's a
    multi-cutural cast that is filled with neat folks.

51. **Blade Runner: 2046**

    Damn. This was definitely one of my favorite movies this year. Every scene
    was so beautiful, and skillfully art-directed. I loved that Mackenzie Davis
    (also from the San Junipero, the Martian, & Halt & Catch Fire) was in this
    too. Harrison Ford was spectacular, and somehow Ryan Reynolds didn't bother
    me. The outfits ruled, and even though I wish there'd been more central
    roles for women, the women that were in the film were neat. I'll own this,
    and watch it more than once, for sure. Now, to find some of the outfits in
    the film...

52. **What Happened to Monday**

    A movie with Noomi Rapace playing 7 different women? I'm in. Willem Dafoe
    was in this too. Mostly this movie was a neat dystopia with lots of twists,
    and even though Noomi Rapace wasn't quite up to Tatiana Maslany's Orphan
    Black performance, it's still really, really well edited.

53. **Landline**

    From the same creators as Obvious Child, which ruled, comes this movie
    about a family in the 90s trying to keep from imploding. Jenny Slate is
    great in this, and the sisterhood on display is pretty adorable. John
    Turturro does a great job too.

54. **Colossal**

    Oh, great, a movie about white people working out their alcoholism and
    relationship issues while murdering folks in Korea. I dunno. This wasn't
    great. Also damn girl, those bangs are LONG.


## 2016

1. **Nine Lives**

    Nothing could redeem this absolute shitpile. We thought it would be funny
    to watch a movie about Kevin Spacey as a cat, but it was _unbearably_ bad.
    Avoid.
