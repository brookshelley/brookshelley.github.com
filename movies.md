_years: [2016](#2016) [2017](#2017) [2018](#2018)_

## 2018 <a name="2018"></a>

**The Endless**

What a bizarre, fantastic film. I loved the world and magic of this movie, as well as the general sense of eerie inevitably. I'm excited to see the previous film as well. The shots of this film are a mix of dutch angles, handheld, and some neat CGI. There's quite a bit of upsetting stuff in this film, but it's also a fun ride.

**47 Meters Down**

Mandy Moore has never scuba-dived, but on a vacation to Mexico, her asshole friend convinces her to scuba in a cage with sharks to forget a man. It goes about as poorly as you’d think. I loved every claustrophobic minute of this. Fuck the ocean, I’m sticking to the rivers and the lakes that I’m used to.

**Mary and the Witch's Flower**

A cute anime about a young girl who stumbles into the world of witchcraft. Very reminiscent of Howl's Moving Castle, but with a less encompassing world.

**Den of Thieves**

A heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop well. He was definitely believable as "the guy who treats everyone like shit, but we're supposed to believe he is a very good dad who just loves his daughters." The plot was decently executed, but it's mostly just a movie with lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the couch.

**Masterminds**

A ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Sudekis. It's about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality physical comedy.

**Book Club**

Watched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great? I love Candace Bergen from the Murphy Brown
days, and hope I look as good as Diane Keaton when I'm older. Silly popcorn fun. Also I guess I own it now because it wasn't available to rent.

**The Meg**

Wow. This is my new favorite sea-based movie. What an epically hilarious
film. A+ good job everyone.

**Mission Impossible Fallout**

A wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I
laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I
love this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and
passionately.

**Ready Player One**

I blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch. It was just
as bad as I thought it would be, but blessedly we could make good jokes
throughout.

**Drive Angry**

There are probably worse Nic Cage movies, but this is the worst one I've
seen. Every scene is painfully bad.

**Tomb Raider**

Fun, and very surprisingly entertaining for a video game movie. Lots of
"oh, I could see how this would play in the game," scenes. Alicia Vikander
is a much better Lara Croft too, imo.

**Sorry to Bother You**

This is the movie Idiocracy wishes it were. Sorry to Bother You skewers
tech culture, bay-area poverty, racial injustice, and so much more.
Throughout, Tessa, Lakeith, and the rest of the cast deliver awesome
performances. A mix of chilling and laugh-inducing. One of the best films
I've seen this year.

**Tragedy Girls**

What a wild, fucked-up movie about social media, murder, and friendship.
Don't do it for the gram.

**I, Tonya**

Finally watched this with a friend, and wow, it was good but full of very
violent abuse stuff. Growing up in the 80s/90s, Tonya Harding was in a lot
of news, but this definitely filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of her
story.

**Villainess**

What a wonderfully bonkers movie. It kicks off with wild first-person murder
fest, and just goes off-the-rails from there. One of the bloodier and wilder action films I've seen in a long time. Loved it.

**The Incredibles 2**

Watched this a few hours after the first one. The animation has gotten a LOT
better, even though the first one honestly aged pretty well, since they didn't
try to make it photorealistic. The plot was ridiculous again, and they definitely
leaned hard into the "men are bad at childcare" shit that I suspected they would.
Fun enough though anyways.

**The Incredibles**

The animation holds up surprisingly well for a few year-old movie, even if
the plot depends on some pretty annoying misogynist tropes. I watched this
to prep for the new movie, and overall it was a fun, if ridiculous, movie.

**Ant Man & the Wasp**

This was a hoot. Very silly, and pretty PG, but above all else, this felt
like a comic movie. I'd compare this to Spiderman Homecoming or a less
stylish Thor Ragnarok. Great summer night movie.

**Sicario**

What a wild movie, in which I needed to completely suspend all of my
feelings about America, the "drug war" and Thanos. If you can attempt to
not emotionally connect to the actual monsters in this movie, it's kinda
fun in a "tense film where things blow up" kind of way.

**Gemini**

Lesbian murder mystery? Yes. This was fun, even if the music felt super
weird at times. Good bangs. Cool cars. A movie where men are the worst.
Also this seems consistent with the choices and habits of geminis, so, lol.
_shots fired_.

**Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom**

Lol, this movie was absurd. They rushed off the island and so many of the
subplots never really paid off? I can't forget that Pratt is a
conservative, and I didn't really care much about anyone in this film,
except for the dinosaurs. I guess I was rooting for the dinosaurs, and I
figure they probably came out ahead.

**Oh Lucy!**

This movie ruled! The world feels pretty rough these days, and this movie
doesn't shy away from difficult topics, but the overarching feeling of Oh
Lucy is a kind and happy one. It was also cool seeing an actor I've watched
in lots of Kiyoshi Kurasawa films show up in a very rad role.

**Ocean's 8**

All. Ladies. Heist. A+. I hope everyone involved in this comes out as gay.
Points for literally every outfit, and double points for Rhianna's
devil-may-care overalls, and Cate Blanchett's Carol-as-a-Timelord character.

**xx**

Terrible title unless everyone involved had to get a karyotype test to be
involved. Most of the horror was related to having kids, which meant this
movie hit me hard, because kids are the worst and deeply frightening on the
best days.

**Unlocked**

I'm a sucker for middling spy movies, and Noomi Rapace, so I now own this
film. It wasn't great, but it was fun, and dammit, sometimes that's all I
need. TIL Michael Douglas is still around.

**Red Sparrow**

I will never believe for one second that the protagonist would fall for Joel
Edgerton's bland spyman. For some reason, I expected this movie to be set
during the cold war, but instead it's vaguely now. This had more sexual
assault than I expected too, which is a fucking bummer. The saving grace in
this film is that by and large Jennifer Lawrence kills or beats all the men
in the movie. I can only hope she gets cast in more movies where she
doesn't have to participate in misogynist porn first.

**Appropriate Behavior**

This was a fun movie about being a Persian Bisexual woman in NYC. Shirin
goes through a major breakup, then struggles to date, and heal, while
dealing with a family she doesn't think will understand her queerness, and
the strange world of the NYC queer and poly scene. I laughed out loud
during a lot of this, even as I scratched my head at the confusing
references to trans guys—like, why are they a joke? Overall, I dug this
movie, and hope the director/writer Desiree makes more films soon.

**Solo**

This was probably tied with Last Jedi for my least favorite of the new Star
Wars, but I liked it better than pretty much any of the old or prequel
ones. It was fun, had a few rad women, and didn't go overboard on "remember
this?" fanservice. I laughed a few times, and I'm hoping they make sequels.

**Deadpool 2**

As fun as Avengers: Infinity War was boring and meh. Full of silly jokes.
There were definitely jokes that were in really poor taste, but pretty
much what I expected.

**Avengers: Infinity War**

This movie tried to tie together too many disparate stories, to bland
effect. The attempt at some sort of emotional climax was a big wet fart,
despite ten people in the theater I was in yelling at the screen. Like,
_spoilers_ they'll all be back, bc Disney isn't going to kill off their
money-makers. Go rewatch Black Panther of Thor Ragnarok, or like, spend 3
hours outside instead.

**In the Fade**

One of the saddest movies I've seen in a long time. It's gorgeous,
well-shot, and soundtracked, but phew, what a brutal movie about the evils
of nazism, and racism.

**Geostorm**

A trash movie in the best way. If you liked watching Jake Gylenhall run
from ice in The Day After Tomorrow, and people saying "zap!" and
"geostorm!", then this movie is for you. Continues the trend of big-budget
action films being largely targeted for non-US success, but that means we
also get some cool co-stars.

**A Quiet Place**

A "good christian family" who _loves_ gender roles has to be _vewwwwwy
quiet_ so they don't get eaten by some kind of creatures. This movie was
silly as fuck. Every time the monster was on screen, someone had to
pantomime "be quiet," as if the entire movie hadn't been quiet. Also
_spoilers_ but how the fuck do you get pregnant if you know that a baby is
going to make loud baby noises and get your family killed? And _where did
they fuck?_ Anyways, this is a hate-watch.

**The Descent**

Another "maybe these are bad people" everything-goes-wrong movie. This was
a rewatch, and yet, the cave scenes still had me feeling super
claustrophobic. It didn't help that I was in the middle of a middle row on
a plane to Portland from Amsterdam when I watched it.

**Cabin Fever**

I can't tell if this was the original, or if this was a remake, but either
way, it's nice to watch annoying and awful people fall apart. This is a
theme of the previous and next movie.

**The Ritual**

A very good "get lost in the woods" movie. Bad things happen to unlikeable
men. A+.

**The Death of Stalin**

Super dark comedy. It has that abusive asshole Jeffrey Tambor, but
otherwise is full of hilariously weird old men. If you like Veep or In the
Thick of It, this is a must-watch.

**Blade**

_rewatch_ Wesley Snipes is a half-vampire vampire hunter. It rules.

**Wrinkle in Time**

I'd recommend listening to [this podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/podcasts/still-processing-we-dont-love-everything-made-by-black-people-and-thats-ok.html) after you see the
movie. It was very, very disney, and they burned through everything pretty
fast without a lot of wonder. Really glad that the god stuff was gone, but
I think they could have jettisoned Calvin too without losing anything.

**Thelma**

A great movie about being queer, growing up Christian, and maybe having
super powers. Relateable AF. Highly recommended.

**Annihilation**

What a wild movie. I read these books back in 2014 when they were released
in a frenzy. I was pretty constantly afraid of the house I was staying in,
as I was pretty well disturbed by the book. It had the kind of sneaky
quality that gets in your head. The movie did a brisker job of telling a
similar story, but I enjoyed it. I'll probalby see this again, and I'm very
curious if they'll try to make more.

**Lost Boys**

I hadn't seen this movie for a long time, but recently [Imogen](https://imogenwatchesclassicfilms.wordpress.com) watched
and talked about it, so my roommate and I sat down for a revisit. It held
up. There's something fantastic about watching these very gay vampire boys
run around and be punk teens. Listen to Imogen's podcast if you can, bc she
says everything I'd wanna cover. Oh, and watch this movie.

**Black Panther**

Holy shit. I thought this movie would be good, but I had no idea how
amazing it would be. Action like woah, a solid plot that doesn't dig into
origin story over and over like other Marvel films, and amazing set and
costume design. The array of talented actors in this film is unbelievable.
This is one of the best films of 2018. No doubt.

**The Cloverfield Paradox**

I'd heard a lot of "this movie isn't good" from folks who hate fun, I
guess. It was fun, and a pretty decent "stuff goes wrong in space" movie. I
LOVE Cloverfield and even though I was mad at the gendered threat of
violence that permeated the entirety of 10 Cloverfield Lane, I still
enjoyed bits of that too. The Cloverfield universe is a wild one that I
really enjoy. See this if you have Netflix, like seeing WoC protagonists,
or like Cloverfield movies.

**I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore**

Elijah Wood is doing his all in this movie, as is Melanie Lynskey. This
goes off the rails midway through, and becomes a thrillride, but keeps up
the laughs. Also, yay for a movie that's set in Portland.


**Hunt for the Wilderpeople**

Ahhh, this ruled! Sam Neil, and the kid are spectacular. Taika has a lovely
cameo as a bizarre priest. This might end up being the best movie I see
this year, and it had me laughing pretty consistently throughout.

**The Raid**

My second viewing of this movie since I saw it in theaters in Berkeley. I
love how rad and amazing this tower-escape film is. The fight scenes and
film style is so kinetic, and carries you through the film. There's not a
lot in the way of plot, but some of it feels like a Die Hard homage.

**The Foreigner**

Jackie Chan vs Irish James Bond. This movie kinda ruled. Jackie Chan is
fantastic, even at 63, at just dominating the screen with his personality
and action. This is definitely a more subdued and serious role than many of
his more famous films, but he shows up and is great. Parts of this reminded
me of taken, and others of _name a political thriller_, but overall I
really enjoyed this movie.

**Battle of the Sexes**

I'd heard good things, and this was pretty fun to watch. The lesbian
storyline was surprisingly compelling, and very well-done. I'm mad that
Adidas didn't reissue BJK's signature shoe when this movie came out though.
It's a good shoe. Steve Carrell seemed like many of his other characters in
this, but whatever... Billy Riggs was an ass, and they do a good job of
showing that.

**Murder on the Orient Express**

Everyone is acting _so hard_ in this, and yet the result is a mess. That
said, I'd watch this again just to see Branaugh's ridiculous mustache.
10/10 mustache. I saw this in Japan, so I had a beer and french fries to
make it slightly better, and pre-roll video that repeated "NO NO NO" in
English to admonish us for even considering texting or talking.

## 2017 <a name="2017"></a>

_this list is super truncated because i forgot keep it until july_

**Life**

Everyone forgets their training, acts like an ass, and gets munched by
aliens. It was entertaining in a schadenfreude way.

**Moonlight**

Cried through most of this. It's about growing up black & gay, with a
neurodiverse mom. It's beautiful, intense, and in my top five movies I've
ever seen. Incredible.

**Get Out**

At times hilarious, and others biting AF. I really loved this movie. A
pitch-perfect callout of "good white folks", like we often are.

**Alien Covenant**

Aliens rule. This movie ruled. Kenny Powers flies a spaceship, and new
Ridley is solid. Also Magneto is creepy AF in this.

**Logan**

It's like Wolverine, but better, because he's old. Also this has Rictor,
who was gay in the comics with Shatterstar. Super entertaining.

**Fast & Furious 8**

Haven't seen one of these? Ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a
time? Start at 1, then watch 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8. I think. Anyways, this is
bonkers in a perfect way.

**Blame!**

A anime movie? Yea, this series by Nihei is kinda rad, and there's cool
killer lady. It's 3D animated, which is kinda the worst, but it doesn't
look horrible in this.

**Rogue One**

Ah, this was super good. A+ characters, fun action, and a lack of space
incest! Also the robot was comic relief without being a jar jar.

**The Autopsy of Jane Doe**

Brian Cox from that other X-Men movie and also Rushmore is a morgue-guy,
like those cuties from Six Feet Under... except spookier. Also I think the
other guy was Spiderman.

**Lego Batman**

Gob Bluth is the bat. This movie is hilarious. Bonus points if you're a DC
comics nerd, or just enjoy fun.

**Train to Busan**

Seriously one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time. Also I
love trains, and this is the best train movie since Snowpiercer.

**Aliens**

Ugh, this sequel to Alien was so good, and still is so good. RIP cool cat,
but yay for all the rad ladies in this. Also Bishop is the only ok robot in
this series.

**Guardians of the Galaxy 2**

Overall, pretty entertaining. Gomorra is cool as always. Baby Groot was
less awful than I expected, and hey! Kurt Russell space dad.

**John Wick 2**

So, this is more Keanu as a vengeful Denzel Washington-esque character, but
not as good. I liked this movie, but also Man on Fire did it better. Well
shot though! And there's at least a nod towards ammo being a thing.

**Kong: Skull Island**

Wow, they just told Samuel L. Jackson to be his one character, which is a
great character. Bonus points for Steve Brule.

**Tremors**

"Featuring Kevin Bacon from Footloose" as the least convincing outdoor
working man in a movie, ever. He and his boyfriend can't leave town, so
they end up fighting giant worms. This movie is super euphemistic,
hilarious, and the best role Reba has ever had.

**Shin Godzilla**

A fantastic look at how modern bureaucracy and posturing can get in the way
of stopping a giant lizard. Too bad they don't show the environmental
devastation wrought by eschewing safety checks.

**Your Name**

A super cute, super straight story of love through time. Imagine if the
Lake House was better, and didn't have Keanu. It's basically this.

**The Girl with All the Gifts**

Another great zombie movie, with a super cute protagonist. Cute kid zombies
are great.

**Raw**

This is literally what happens if you break vegan.

**Prometheus**

Had to rewatch this after Covenant. Still perfect. Naomi Rapace could do
her taxes on film, and I'd probably be riveted. She rules.

**Justice League Dark**

I wanted this to be better. It was so-so, and seriously, _Swamp Thing_?

**The Heat**

A send-up of Lethal Weapon + every buddy cop film. Mcarthy and Bullock are
fantastic in this.

**Keanu**

I will watch this yearly, as it's one of the 4 movies I own. Get high, and
watch this movie about a kitten, and the men who love him.

**Wicker Man**

Nick Cage at his most unhinged. Well, close to it. My roommate hadn't seen
this, so I introduced her to this hilarious hellride.

**Neon Demon**

Don't get into modeling. It'll end badly. This movie was beautiful, gory,
and wild.

**Kubo**

I've enjoyed other movies from this studio more – Coraline for one – but this was still fun.

**Baby Driver**

I'd avoided watching this because I hadn't read great things about it, save for [this review by Matt Haughey](https://15minutes.inthemorni.ng/baby-driver-was-fantastic-2acd21be54ba). While I agree with him that the opening action scene was stellar, so
were the short films BMW made with greats like Wong Kar Wai a few years ago
to sell cars. I liked watching this film, but it's unfortunate that the men
were two-dimensional, and the women collapsed in on themselves, with no
characterization, or much motivation. I'd expected a bit more of Edgar
Wright, but on the upside, the musical cues were also quite good. I'm not
fully sure if this is a tribute to old McQueen movies, or what, but it was
alright, but I can't co-sign the _fantastic_ from the above. It was
exciting, but the stakes weren't ever high, because I never cared much
about the protagonist, because I was given no reason to care. We've seen
chases before, parkour, car work. This movie could've elevated them
further, but it chose not to. I never believed there really was jeopardy,
because as the movie, and the news of the day makes clear, "he's such a
good boy," is something that will always apply to the white male criminal.

**Valerian**

The short version is that this was very targetted towards a Chinese release, partially due to the studio financing, and even Besson was
[promoting it on Weibo](http://chinafilminsider.com/valerian-city-thousand-planets-passes-china-censorship/). I had a great time watching this movie, but it was pretty
dang ridiculous, and had super traditional and boring gender roles and
"marriage is the best" kind of crap. Still, the visuals were incredible,
and it was a fun space romp. Recommended.

**Secret Life of Pets**

I blame my friend Andy – they wanted to watch this because they were tired
and we thought it'd be cute. It was very cute, but also pretty silly. I
dunno. Kids probably loved it. There's some good cats.

**Atomic Blonde**

Charlize Theron as a queer badass assassin/spy? Sold. Because this is
mainstream Hollywood, of course that doesn't last, but still... this was a
fun romp. A summer movie devoid of substance, but thick and heavy with
style and silliness.

**Flatliners**

Kiefer oozes weird attraction in this classic about chasing the meaning of
life by dying for minutes. I saw a trailer for the _sequel_ to this, I
guess, with Ellen Page, so I had to revisit the original. I loved it all
over again. Spooky and silly. And, to quote my roommate, "how many Baldwins
are there?!"

**They're Watching**

This was goofy as hell, and was sort of a comedic Blair Witch in Moldova
thing. Near the end it takes a sharp left, and we were cracking up. Worth
watching on Netflix, perhaps?

**2012**

A beautifully terrible film by the guy who brought us
The Day After Tomorrow. I love a movie where we're led to believe that John
Cusack is the best driver in the world, and a writer-cum-action hero. I
love watching this movie when I'm camping, or hiking for a few days,
because it's so ridiculous, and also it's wild to watch the world end,
however silly the movie.

**In This Corner of the World**

SO. MANY. TEARS. My friends and I sobbed through a lot of this film about
the atrocities of World War 2, especially the destruction the United States
caused in Japan. The movie follows a woman living in Hiroshima, then Kure,
who grows up in the 30s and 40s, and sees her friends and loved ones suffer
during the war. It's beautiful, hilarious at times, and sad. This movie is
a shift on the view that Grave of the Fireflies offers, but definitely in
similar territory.

**The Visit**

Guessed the twist about 20 minutes into this movie and i'm really proud of
that because I'm usually the worst at figuring out where bad movies are
headed. Don't trust your grandparents. Don't send your kids anywhere. Don't
ever clean your oven.

**The Conjuring**

This was great, until the witch didn't win. I can't help but think these
movies are trying to get me to follow their lord and savior.

**The Conjuring 2**

Yep, these are definitely witnessing. A cool demon has a hard time with
some very awful British people. Watched both of these in quick succession
to get to see Annabelle 2 or whatever later on tonight.

**Annabelle: Creation**

This was a very silly movie with children making terrible choices. I don't
think dolls themselves are very scary, but Catholicism is definitely scary.
Everyone who gets hunted by the demon or whatever was also a practicing
Catholic, so maybe being a satanist or atheist would be some kinda ghost
protection.

**Wall-E**

One of the best movies ever, and it's held up super well in animation and
craft. I love this robot.

**I think I watched a movie about a plague**

I was on a LOT of drugs for surgery, so I have no idea what this was
called, but I'm pretty sure I saw it before?

**The Happening**

This fucking movie is straight-up incredible. Mark Wahlberg at his best
"I'm just happy to be here," and a whole lot of incredibly banal deaths.
Zooey "Literal Beige Person" Deschanel is also in this for some reason.
Anyways, I love that this was one of the movies we all saw, hoping for the
return of that GOOD GOOD Sixth Sense action, and instead we got this
beautiful god trash. Eat a pound of desert pudding and cry about humanity.
"I'm gonna give you... a math riddle."

**IT**

Hadn't seen it, and wow what a silly joy. Not scary at all, but I'm
definitely even less trustworthy of Tim Curry now, I guess? Everyone is
giving their all in this movie.

**Wonder Woman**

Ok, I finally saw it. I literally couldn't stop thinking about Gal being
part of an anti-Palestian army, but once Chris Pine made me laugh by doing
a bad German accent. This movie bravely asks the question: "she's a
goddess, but when will she become super saiyan?" Not particularly into this
movie.

**Spiderman: Homecoming**

This is the kind of superhero film that makes me smile. I think this is the
best reboot of the Spiderman franchise, and it is filled with silly, fun
moments, that emphasize the more joyful aspects of the character. I'm
looking forward to the next few. Marvel seems like they're just going to
keep making better movies than DC, save for the Nolan Batman movies.
Speaking of Batman – the second best modern Batman (Michael Keaton) also
plays the Vulture in this movie. Go figure. Anyways, this was a fun romp.

**Ingrid Goes West**

Everyone besides Dan is terrible in this movie, and Dan is hella
co-dependent. This is a biting satire of the lives folks live in pursuit of
Instagram perfection. #blessed #wow_millenials #the_other_olsen

**Death Becomes Her**

Bruce Willis, with _hair_! Wow. Everything about this movie is perfect.
Women seeking eternal youth. Isabella Rossilini just oozing charisma and
power. Inexplicable wrestling manservants. Mincing Bruce Willis. The
prothesis in this movie is _hella_ Beetlejuice. I loved it.

**New IT**

I think I'm broken inside, because jump scares and all of the "scary" bits
of this film didn't phase me. It was at times pretty cute, but the misogyny
and against the only girl in the group was the scariest thing of all. I'm
interested to see what they do with the second part of this movie. The
visuals were kinda neat and well-done.

**Friend Request**

Wow, this movie was garbage. I ended up skipping through it because the
first 20 minutes were so painful. 0 thumbs out of 20.

**The Hitman's Bodyguard**

Samuel L Jackson at 68 in The Hitman's Bodyguard is doing a better job than
most action guys half his age. What a goofy, fun movie. It's not
particularly smart, but it was a wonderful romp. A summer action movie
through and through.

**Ghost in the Shell (with ScarJo & white-washing)**

The fashion was kinda neat, and some of the visuals were cool. The story
seemed worse than the anime though, and I can't tell if ScarJo can't act,
or just collected a paycheck. Bonus points to Beat Takeshi for just
speaking Japanese the entire time, unlike the rest of the characters. He's
great. I hope he got paid for this trash.

**xXx: The Return of Xander Cage**

Wow, this movie was over-the-top ridiculous. And the terrible coat was back
from the first movie. I think this canonically takes place in the Marvel
universe, because of Samuel L. Jackson. I have no idea why xXx uses
"extreme sports" people, soccer stars, and a DJ(?), but here we are. I love
this very, very goofy series, and bought this movie with a big grin when it
was no longer available for rent. Everyone is having a blast, and it's a
multi-cultural cast that is filled with neat folks.

**Blade Runner: 2046**

Damn. This was definitely one of my favorite movies this year. Every scene
was so beautiful, and skillfully art-directed. I loved that Mackenzie Davis
(also from the San Junipero, the Martian, & Halt & Catch Fire) was in this
too. Harrison Ford was spectacular, and somehow Ryan Reynolds didn't bother
me. The outfits ruled, and even though I wish there'd been more central
roles for women, the women that were in the film were neat. I'll own this,
and watch it more than once, for sure. Now, to find some of the outfits in
the film...

**What Happened to Monday**

A movie with Noomi Rapace playing 7 different women? I'm in. Willem Dafoe
was in this too. Mostly this movie was a neat dystopia with lots of twists,
and even though Noomi Rapace wasn't quite up to Tatiana Maslany's Orphan
Black performance, it's still really, really well edited.

**Landline**

From the same creators as Obvious Child, which ruled, comes this movie
about a family in the 90s trying to keep from imploding. Jenny Slate is
great in this, and the sisterhood on display is pretty adorable. John
Turturro does a great job too.

**Colossal**

Oh, great, a movie about white people working out their alcoholism and
relationship issues while murdering folks in Korea. I dunno. This wasn't
great. Also damn girl, those bangs are LONG.

**Beyond the Gates**

Very silly movie about a VCR-based horror game that... is really happening.
A fun time for the spooky holidays.

**Pitch Black**

Vin's other, other series. Vin Diesel plays the same character, but this
time, he's in a _space_ black tank top, and his eyes glow because he can
see in the dark, I guess? There's a genderqueer-ish person in this film,
but I checked and the actress is definitely a straight and
feminine-presenting woman now. Was hoping Jack grew up to be a
genderfucking weirdo cool kid.

**Fried Green Tomatoes**

This was charming and cute. It wasn't as gay as I wanted it to be, but was
gayer than most. RIP Smokey. RIP other characters. I read the book before I
saw this movie, somehow, and I missed some of the book scenes, but overall
this was fun.

**The Babysitter**

If I'd watched this alone I would've turned it off after a few minutes. It
was garbage. It's like the creators of Scary Movie read Ready Player One,
and thought, yea, we can do that. Terrible.

**The VVitch**

This movie rules. It's about jettisoning a sex-negative, shitty family for
the loving embrace of Satan and a coven of witches. The vibe is sullen AF,
and very stark. I think I've seen this movie five times, three of those in
the theater. This was a perfect movie to watch during Samhain.

**Thor: Ragnarok**

A+ super hero movie. Silly and unpretentious.

**Lady Bird**

The truest old millennial movie. I cried a lot.

**The Room**

Terrible movie. Great rewatch. This movie is epically bad, and I hope
everyone has had a chance to see the copious softcore sex scenes, and
confusing "american man" football rituals.

**Okja**

A sometimes cute, sometimes very grim movie about the evils of capitalism
and factory farming. The protagonist is the cutest, and is really giving
her all in every scene, and Paul Dano and Jake Gylenhall manage to not
spoil the movie with their characters. Steven Yuen is pretty great, and
Tilda Swinton continues in her consistent "I'm definitely not an alien in
human skin" character from movies of yore.

**The Disaster Artist**

Wow. This movie is a parade of actors and actresses who loved the Room in
all it's weirdness. This movie falls somewhere between a tribute, a satire,
and a dramatic reinterpretation documentary. I loved it. Saw this with
another long-time The Room fan, and we both were in tears laughing. I will
see this again. The podcast [How Did This Get Made?](http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-disaster-artist/) has a [great episode](http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-disaster-artist/) for
this movie too that begins with their The Room episode.

**It Follows**

This is my second viewing, and this movie was still unbelievably creepy. I
made my friend watch American Vandal with me after this to get less scared.
It's a horror film about an STI haunting. I dunno. It's wild. Watch this,
but be ready to always watch for a single, slowly-walking person in a crowd.

**Rare Exports**

A perfectly weird holiday movie about the real santa.

**Die Hard**

It's a wonderful holiday time for everyone, except german models turned
"terrorist". Points to this one for accurately pointing out that white
people are the bad guys though.

**Star Wars: The Last Jedi**

Here for this. Love the porgs, and love Luke punking Kylo. This was a great
combination of ridiculous and fun. I like that Rian brought more humor into
the world of the star war.

**Nine Lives**

Nothing could redeem this absolute shitpile. We thought it would be funny
to watch a movie about Kevin Spacey as a cat, but it was _unbearably_ bad.
Avoid.
