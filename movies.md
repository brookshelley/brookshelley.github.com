# movies i've watched

## 2017

_this list is super truncated because i forgot keep it until July_

1. **Life**

2. **Moonlight**

3. **Get Out**

2. **Alien Covenant**

    Aliens rule. This movie ruled. Kenny Powers flies a spaceship, and new Ridley is solid. Also Magneto is creepy AF in this.

3. **Logan**

    It's like Wolverine, but better, because he's old. Also this has Rictor, who was gay in the comics with Shatterstar. Super entertaining.

4. **Fast & Furious 8**

    Haven't seen one of these? Ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a time? Start at 1, then watch 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8. I think. Anyways, this is bonkers in a perfect way.

5. **Rogue One**

    Ah, this was super good. A+ characters, fun action, and a lack of space incest! Also the robot was comic relief without being a jar jar.

6. **The Autopsy of Jane Doe**

    Brian Cox from that other X-Men movie and also Rushmore is a morgue-guy, like those cuties from Six Feet Under... except spookier. Also I think the other guy was Spiderman.

7. **Lego Batman**

    Gob Bluth is the bat. This movie is hilarious. Bonus points if you're a DC comics nerd, or just enjoy fun.

8. **Train to Busan**

    Seriously one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time. Also I love trains, and this is the best train movie since Snowpiercer.
