My parents were both over 6&rsquo; tall, and I
worried about being as big as them. Most of my friends ended up being shorter
than me, and were usually skinnier too. I was made fun of for being &ldquo;chubby&rdquo; in
middle school, and that stuck with me. Being fat or chubby or skinny all rule,
but I didn&rsquo;t know that as a kid. I just thought I was broken, bc I didn&rsquo;t have
a flat chest or whatever the other kids did at 12. I used to worry about my
weight all the time, and no matter what I ate, or didn&rsquo;t eat, I kept some
love-handles. Eventually I got used to my body, and now I love it. There&rsquo;s a
longer story there, but generally not wanting to be &ldquo;big&rdquo; kept me away from
weights, and on a bike.</p><h2 id=present-day>Present day</h2><p>I still keep track of my weight, but on a longer time-scale, and these days,
it&rsquo;s less about getting down to a number, and more in line with general
health-tracking. I did yoga regularly for around three years, but I never felt
stronger, just usually more calm, which rules too. Last summer, I read
<a href=https://www.thehairpin.com/2017/08/the-myths-of-bodyweight-training/>The Myth of Bodyweight Training</a> and then a bunch of posts from Casey about powerlifting,
and thought, &ldquo;ok, I&rsquo;ll try this&rdquo;. I heard about <a href=http://boldandbadass.com>Bold &amp; Badass</a> from some
<a href=https://2018.xoxofest.com>XOXO</a> friends, and went in for a session. Then I
went back, and back, and back. I took off some time last year due to an
unrelated surgery, and a trip to Japan in January, but since February, I&rsquo;ve
gone two days a week on average, with July and August being closer to three,
and four most days. It feels great, and I feel both stronger and happier while
there and on rest days. The focus and calm I found during yoga is present during
powerlifting, but I can also track progress, which I enjoy because
I&rsquo;m a nerd.</p><h2 id=wtf-is-powerlifting>WTF is &ldquo;powerlifting&rdquo;?</h2><p>Simply put: bench-pressing, squatting, and deadlifting. I usually do accessory
workouts and a lot of stuff that gets my heart-rate up for cardio health, but
those three lifts are the crux of powerlifting, and in competition, the total
of the 3 weights lifted are what your&rsquo;e judged on. It rules. There&rsquo;s so much
complexity and muscle memory involved in doing these lifts well, and it&rsquo;s
really helpful to have a trainer, and start very light. But, once you get the
hang of it, you end up lifting more than you would ever imagine.</p><h2 id=gains>Gains?</h2><p>I still remember my first sessions bench-pressing ~80lbs, squatting ~100lbs,
and deadlifting 65lbs (the bar + 10lbs on each side to lift it up). These days
I&rsquo;m very proud to be bench-pressing 175, squatting 245, and deadlifting 345.
It&rsquo;s been a <em>lot</em> of work to get to this point, but I can see the progress. My
gym is doing a summer of strength at this point, and that means a specific
linear training regimen that means each time I lift with my arms (bench/OHP),
I add 2.5lbs, and each time I lift with my legs (squat/DL), I add 5 lbs.
Once we get to a place where we can&rsquo;t do a 3rd set of 5, after first trying for
a third set of 5-10 for as many weeks as possible, we unload by 10% and start
over. It&rsquo;s freeing knowing what I&rsquo;m going to lift before I start each day, and
having the encouragement of all the awesome folks in my gym as we all strive
to improve our personal numbers. Our competition is with ourselves, largely,
and that&rsquo;s the most fun kind, in my opinion.</p><h2 id=lifting-is-silly>Lifting is silly</h2><p>I want to be clear that the benefits to my mental and physical health also come
with a new type of self-aware humor about the whole thing. Gyms are weird, and
lifting heavy stuff is particularly silly. I&rsquo;m lucky that a lot of my coworkers
also love powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting (clean &amp; jerks, and snatches),
so we can laugh even as we cheer each other on. Being able to enjoy things, and
laugh at/with them is super important to me. Plus, have you seen the long socks
for sumo? JK, they rule.</p><h2 id=getting-started>Getting started</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re stoked on lifting at all, and you&rsquo;re in Portland, come join me at
Bold &amp; Badass, or find a body-positive gym in your area. If you read this, but
still have zero interest, then&hellip; thanks for reading?</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/thoughts>thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><div class=site-description></div><nav class="nav social"><ul class=flatfoot-about><a href=/index.xml title=RSS><i data-feather=rss></i></a><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=Github><i data-feather=github></i></a><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><i data-feather=mail></i></a><a href=/about title=about><i data-feather=info></i></a></ul><ul><p class=flatfoot>brook 2020</p></ul></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
