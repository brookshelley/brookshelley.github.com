Unlike <em>Texts from Jane Eyre</em>, his first book of imagined text conversations from literary characters, this reader at least felt prepared for these fables, stories, and tall-tales through study of European folklore. Even more, each story brought a sly smile to my face as I discovered the layers of joyful twisting of stories well and lesser-known.</p><p>“Fear Not: An Incident Log” tells of a heavenly bureaucrat who, they assure us, “(has) never once been reprimanded for how I comport myself under the sun.” We spend the story learning of the machinations of a certain kind of supernatural world, adjacent to the typical christian god, angels, and satan. As I read this story, I laughed out loud in public, and felt a welling of joy.</p><p>Another tale that wormed its soft, velveteen pages into my heart was “The Rabbit” — about a boy who gives his love to a toy that may or may not be sucking the life force of the child away. It’s devilish fun. Each story in this collection has a sparkle in its eye, and just a bit of dirt on its face, as if to say, “Who, me? I couldn’t have broken the window, Ms., as I studied all day.” This is a collection for rascals, miscreants, and students of folktale who smoked behind the liberal arts building, and threw rocks at their shadow.</p><p>As a reader, I tore through these tales quickly, but as with any fairytale, I plan to revisit these regularly, until their devilish stories take the place of better known tellings. Ortberg surely has a gift, revealed by his early work in frightening children’s tales on The Toast, but for his sophomore publication, I can see a writer hitting his stride, and stretching his legs. I can’t wait to see what further fictions he brings us. The Merry Spinster is a triumph.</p></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><ul class=flat><li><a href=/about>about</a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
