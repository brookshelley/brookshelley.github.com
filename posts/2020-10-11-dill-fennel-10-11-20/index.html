If you’ve waited for a while to get a new phone, or really want something smaller, <a href=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-12-top-features/>you might just be in luck</a>. Whether the rumors amount to anything, Apple is definitely launching something on Tuesday. I’ll be tuning in.</p><p>More than the phone even, I’m excited to see if they actually ship a computer with their own silicon. It seems like the main feature will be performance, with a side of excellent battery life. I can’t wait.</p><p>Other than tech shit, this week was nice and chill. The smoke outside continues to plague my bike rides, and the plague is a constant worry, but those are almost background pain at this point.</p><p>I hope you’re taking it easy as well, and that you have a neighbor who gives you bonus fruits from their trees! Thanks Haley for the amazing passion fruit!</p><p>This week should be good, so let’s get to it:</p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><ul><li>It’s always good to start off your Sunday with a little bit of dancing:</li></ul><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>thread of moments from the star wars weekends dance offs at disney world because I CANT BELIEVE THIS WAS A REAL THING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED <a href=https://t.co/odwaFnQ5Rs>pic.twitter.com/odwaFnQ5Rs</a></p>&mdash; caitlin (@SITHLEIAS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SITHLEIAS/status/1313240578566492161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><ul><li>But remember, while you dance (outside) be sure to wear a <a href=http://toolsandtoys.net/tom-bihn-v3-three-layer-cloth-face-mask/>good mask</a> and stay well-away from your fellow Ewoks.</li><li>I just learned that my way too brilliant coworker Bert <a href=https://bert.org/2020/10/01/pressing-yubikeys/>made a finger to tap his Yubikey</a>. This is just the kind of disturbingly smart shit I love. I’m reminded of my friend Mark’s somewhat abandoned project to make a “cloud finger” that would open the garage door to our office a few years ago.
