<img src=/photos/ioshome2020.jpg alt></p><h2 id=another-year>Another year</h2><p>Every year for the <a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-28-2019-iphone-homescreen/>past</a> few <a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-14-2018-iphone-homescreen-update/>years</a> I’ve written about the apps I’m using and what appears on my iPhone Home Screen. It’s become a fun annual post to think through how the app ecosystem and iOS in general changed over the year. I still use my iPhone quite a bit in quarantine, as it remains the easiest thing to haul around my house for podcast control and random tasks.</p><h2 id=more-change>More change</h2><p><strong>3 app dock</strong></p><p>I kept my 3 app dock from <a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-28-2019-iphone-homescreen/>last year</a>, but replaced Music with Slack. I use Slack pretty constantly for keeping in touch with my friends, and also I work there. Lately, in order to encourage myself to <em>log off</em> from work on my off-hours, I removed my work workspaces from my phone. It’s delightful.</p><p>The other two apps are the same—Messages and Reeder. Both of these apps are a lifeline to loved-ones and reading respectively. I subscribed to a few friends’ Twitter feeds and a few newsletters in Reeder using Feedbin, and it’s quieter and <a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-10-slower-reading/>slower over there</a>.</p><p><strong>No new app icons</strong></p><p>An astute reader will see the five app icons on my homescreen and think: “wow, you’ve gotten rid of everything!” And indeed I have! iOS 14 brought the delightful App Library which enabled hiding most apps from the homescreen, relegating them to search and odd Apple-generated categories. I likely have a few <em>more</em> apps on my phone than before, but I never see them unless I need them. I love it.</p><p>Overcast keeps getting better, especially with Marco focusing on stability and usability over rushing to get iOS 14 widgets or other whiz bang new things into the app. I like that Marco seems to get that so many of us depend on this app daily, and takes major changes seriously.</p><p>iAWriter is where I write. Full stop. I wrote this post in iAWriter, and even wrote about <a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/hugo-and-i-a-writer/><em>how I write in it</em></a>. It’s outstanding. I would happily pay much more money just to keep this app going. A+.</p><h2 id=widgets>Widgets!</h2><p>The elephant on my homescreen is the two prominent widgets at the top of the device. With the addition of regularly updating, informative blocks of app, I move my calendar and my music player into this format.</p><p>Fantastical is back! The widgets are great, and even though I can’t make it the <em>default app</em> in iOS this year—maybe next year? I think Fantastical still looks kinda weird on the iPad, but since I can view a smaller bit of it actively in a widget, I don’t need to open the full app nearly as often. The customization of the Fantastical widget is delightful, as <a href=https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/09/23/fantastical-widgets-ios-14>others have written</a>.</p><p>Longplay is a new app this year that focuses on reminding the listener about older, neglected albums in our collection. I think the way it changes around album art is cool looking, and I especially love that it focuses on the <em>album</em> as a coherent whole, unlike many modern music apps that are more geared towards singles and bangers.</p><p>On my left screen&mldr; formerly the widget area (is this the name?) lives one app that was previously on my homescreen and another I went back to after an update.

Things remains the way I get anything done in my life. I love it so much on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The sync is fantastic, the organization is just-enough, and the keyboard shortcuts are a master class in how to do them right.</p><p>Carrot Weather temporarily dethroned Hello Weather due to the addition of widgets. I still don’t love this app or how it displays data, but the widgets are delightfully minimal so I don’t need to look at the whole app often.</p><p>Simple is my banking app. It’s important to always have “funny numbers” in your account as a key to appeasing the money demons that ensure a positive ROI. Top tip.</p><h2 id=other-notable-apps>Other notable apps</h2><p>Working Copy and Secure Shellfish aren’t on my homescreen, but they’re both pretty crucial to a few kinds of server and front-end work that I do for fun on the iPad and iPhone.</p><p>Darkroom is the photo editor I moved to after some recent updates made it even better. I still wish it could resize photos on export, instead of just changing the quality of the photo or video, but hopefully later they’ll be able to. In the meantime, I made an iOS shortcut that does the resizing for me, and commits the photo to my blog’s repo.</p><h2 id=missing-widgets>Missing widgets</h2><p>One day soon, I hope my bank adds a widget, as well as Wealthfront, and perhaps Overcast and Sonos. Tot would also be an excellent widget for quick text entry. I don’t know if I’d keep it up all the time, but my Deliveries app also primarily functions as a read-only list, so it would be ideal for a side-screen widget.</p><h2 id=future-hopes>Future hopes</h2><p>I’m curious as more developers add widgets if their interest in adding more options for sizing and location. I think it’d be neat to have a single app icon widget, as well as write-capable widgets. Perhaps we’ll see this customization in iOS 15. I think now that the floodgates are open for what TikTok youth are seeing as custom themes, it’ll be hard to stem the tide of interest in actual shareable themes a-la Apple Watch. Further, I think it’d be pretty silly if iOS widgets and Apple Watch widgets didn’t end-up unifying in the future.</p><p>Ultimately, I’m super glad I don’t need to keep a ton of apps on my homescreen, and instead can show the apps I use most.</p></div><div class=post-tags></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=tweet rel=me><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github rel=me><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>© 2020 by brook shelley</div></div></body></html>
