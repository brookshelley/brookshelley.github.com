Last year was <em>big</em>, which meant it was even harder to wave at, or spend time with the other amazing attendees I knew. This year, it felt just right. I still waved at too many folks, and wished I had time to have a number of small dinners over the next year instead of so many “hey, I see you, sorry I’ve gotta run!” However, I got to spend time with a smallish group of friends, see all the talks I wanted, and even play some <a href=http://www.killerqueenblack.com>amazing</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ_I8SSVKto">new</a> <a href=https://play.date>games</a>.
If you’ve never been to XOXO, and you make things on the internet, and enjoy building relationships, this is a great place for you.</p><h2 id=day-one>Day one</h2><p>As usually, the first day of the conference was a social one—with Glitch doing an <a href=https://glitch.com/~appy-hour>Appy Hour</a>, and Panic showing off the <a href=https://play.date>Playdate</a>. It was super cool seeing all the strange community games and creations of Glitch users, along with a few presentations, and the Playdate is something I can’t wait to own. Topped-off with a dinner at Kachka, a lot of upcoming games, and one of the <a href=https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/9/9/20849172/unraveled-how-to-calculate-pet-hp-hit-points>most hilarious videos</a> I’ve seen in a while, wherein Brian Gilbert attempts to calculate his pet’s HP, Friday was a delight. The weather held, the <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1171647388001406976?s=21">toilets were uniquely chill</a>, and the layout of the festival ensure I could wander and find neat things.</p><h2 id=day-two>Day two</h2><p>One of the first pieces of advice I’d give anyone going to a multi-day festival is “don’t drink too much on the first night”. I didn’t take my own advice. I wasn’t ill, but a combination of 3 glasses of wine and too little sleep meant 10am felt <em>very</em> early. Thankfully my hotel had Proud Mary coffee, and XOXO had Deadstock. A breakfast sandwich from Fried Egg I’m in Love completed my resurrection.</p><p>Day two felt a little longer, as I sat through every talk, alternately crying and laughing. A definite emotional rollercoaster. Helen and Hrishikesh were excellent hosts, and seeing their banter develop over the weekend makes me hope they host again next year. I missed the Andy’s camaraderie at times, but I hope <em>only</em> being responsible for the whole festival was a nice change from also MCing.</p><p>Lunch was Basilisk. Unbeatable fried chicken I eat every time I visit Portland. Yes, even when I’m there for hours.</p><p>Favorite talks from Saturday: Harry Brewis (very funny guy who I didn’t know anything about beforehand), Hundred Rabbits (delightful French Canadian vegan sailors), and Soleil Ho (what happens when you become the representation?!).</p><p>After a quick dinner, I sat down for a night of unforgettable podcasts. I watched a man interview a chainsaw, and was utterly destroyed by Demi and Miel with special guests Neil and Mike doing Ray Parker Jr’s Ghostbuster song. The number of folks I heard singing “bustin’ makes me feel good” after this podcast taping tells me I wasn’t alone.</p><h2 id=day-3-closing-time>Day 3 (Closing time)</h2><p>Coffee. Sandwich. Almost there. I was wiped at this point, but the talks were delightful. Mikki Kendall, Jenny Odell, and Rhea Butcher were my favorites from Sunday. A great mix of comedy and art. Food highlights were Navarre (another favorite), and dinner at Sardine Head. OMG Sardine Head. Oxidated white wine. Salt-cured anchovy. Dang.</p><p>The karaoke list was full by the time my friends and I got back from dinner, and a cab ride that included an episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1170902500083322880?s=21">King of the Hill</a>. It was fun watching various speakers and friends sing Pavement, Lizzo, and of course, the Ghostbuster’s theme. I ended my night with my friends Jenny and Joe, drinking on the balcony at my hotel. Our friend André’s room was right by the balcony, and he wandered out mid-way through. That moment of kismet was generally how the whole conference felt—friends wandering by, saying hi, and going on adventures.</p><h2 id=a-great-year>A great year</h2><p>XOXO at its best feels like what I imagine a community <em>should</em> feel like. It’s full of new people, old people, dear friends, and acquaintances. If XOXO was every day, I would lose my mind, but once a year, it feels incredible to be surrounded by so many people I care about, as we’re inspired together by talks, art, and each other. I’m so glad I got to go to Portland, for the first time as a non-resident, for XOXO. I can’t wait for another year of this magical festival, and hope many of the same folks will get to attend. My only regret is that I can’t somehow bring Snorri with me too. He’d hate it.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/reviews>reviews</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=footer><div class=site-description></div><nav class="nav social"><ul class=flatfoot-about><a href=/index.xml title=RSS><i data-feather=rss></i></a><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=Github><i data-feather=github></i></a><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><i data-feather=mail></i></a></ul><ul class=flatfoot-about><li class=flatfoot><a href=/about>about</a></li><li class=flatfoot>brook 2020</li></ul></nav></div></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
