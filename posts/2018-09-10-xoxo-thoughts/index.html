Today, I am tired, happy, and trying to remember what to do for work when I&rsquo;m not awkwardly wandering around a stadium full of 2000+ people.</p><h2 id=so-many-people>So. Many. People.</h2><p>This year I was overwhelmed by the size of XOXO in ways I hadn&rsquo;t been in the past. To be fair, two years ago I was only a year into working from home, whereas now I&rsquo;m 3 years a hermit, but still, 2000 people is a <em>lot</em>. It felt like 100-200 people were folks I either knew from Twitter, friends, or Slack, and the &ldquo;should I wave or say hi?&rdquo; feeling that keeps me from going to parties was <em>hugely</em> amplified here. Fortunately, there were good talks, and things that weren&rsquo;t socially awkward to attend. Also, as always, having a friend or two around is a good salve fo my anxiety, and leaving the venue often to eat was vital.</p><h2 id=cool-stuff>Cool stuff.</h2><p>The games were neat. I only played Plunge, but watching Neo Cab, and untitled goose game was fun. Also, Laura Hall&rsquo;s very good ARG was silly good, with a chill payoff at the end. I felt lucky to do it early, before the 60+ person line after the Andys announced its existence on stage. Open Mike Eagle, Demi, and Janelle Shane gave particularly fun talks. I often felt like the bird in a psychological experiment that dies between two equidistant food bowls, but often just gave-in and stayed at the same thing for a while to avoid zipping to-and-fro.</p><p>The friends I caught up with were a huge highlight, especially folks I got to eat with and wander around with. It&rsquo;s really helpful to have a small crew that are a known quantity, so when I was out of energy, I knew what to expect. I hosted two friends this time as well, and coming home with them was like returning home with some family. I made the choice more than once to eschew an activity for some time with a few people, and that felt very rewarding.</p><h2 id=next-year>Next year</h2><ul><li><p>I hope the size of XOXO goes down again next year.
If this means more sponsorship, community funding, and other methods for a quarter -&gt; half of the attendees to not pay for a ticket.</p></li><li><p>I also hope that there is a little less parallel programming that isn&rsquo;t recorded.
Needing to use the restroom, take a break, or eat food often felt like a frustrating trade-off with wanting to see a friend talk or perform.</p></li><li><p>Karaoke was good, but the very talented musicians who performed drastically altered the room.
Next year, more than one karaoke room could be rad.</p></li><li><p>I loved the free soda, but paid alcohol system, especially because it discouraged heavy drinking, I think.</p></li><li><p>The bathrooms were about what I expected for a stadium, but I hope next year they&rsquo;re a little less brutalist/low-ceilinged.</p></li><li><p>I don&rsquo;t know if Revolution Hall is a better venue, but I definitely missed the outside yard area, because grass fields are nicer than concrete pavilions.</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, I don&rsquo;t envy the Andys any of the planning, listening, or responding they&rsquo;ve spent years doing, and think they&rsquo;ve put together an extremely good, complicated event. I will probably try to attend again in 2019, circumstances permitting. Community is hard. I think it&rsquo;s worth it.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/thoughts>thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
