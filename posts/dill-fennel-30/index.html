I’ve also thought about getting back into shooting photos and biking around, which could be a fun adventure. In preparation, I even picked-up a <a href=https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iii>new camera</a>, so expect better pictures of my cat and neighborhood soon. Can you believe there’s only one more week in July? I wish I could go swimming somewhere, but I don’t think it’s in the cards.</p><p><img src=/photos/snorrisleep.jpg alt=sleepysnorri></p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><ul><li>Enter the world of <a href=https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-inside-the-high-stakes-world-of-clandestine-crude-shipping>clandestine shipping</a>. I’m fascinated by what feels like <em>real spy shit</em> but is a lot of staring at satellite imagery all day. Maybe spy shit is boring most of the time?</li><li>Fuck the Kochs and their <a href=https://www.inthepublicinterest.org/wp-content/uploads/ITPI_USPSPrivatization_July2020.pdf>war against our country</a>. Personally, I depend on the USPS for so much stuff, and I believe having a national mail service is vital to any thriving nation. Perhaps we should instead not require the post office to turn a profit? Thank your postal worker in the meantime, because they’re literally risking their lives to serve us.</li><li>For a long time we’ve know that tipping is a bad deal for everyone, but did you also know it has <a href=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/17/william-barber-tipping-racist-past-227361>origins in white supremacy</a>? Turns out. I wish we had zero sales tax (it’s regressive), and a high living wage for all workers that didn’t need to go to healthcare. I’m trying to think a little bit about a positive future in the ruins of pre-covid world, especially after reading <a href=https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/134/>50 folks in Monocle thinking big</a>.</li><li>Finding yourself with free time, and thinking about doing your own thing? Top tip: <a href=https://jmduke.com/2020/06/26/atypical-success>find a small niche</a>. I love and use a few products made by very small teams, and find the prospect of making a chill “lifestyle” company pretty interesting. Perhaps one day when I’m interested in trying something new, I’ll try my hand at atypical success.</li></ul><h2 id=in-closing>In closing</h2><p>Think about the apps and services you depend on, and the ones you truly love. Who’re the made by? <a href=https://ia.net/writer>My writing tool</a>, which I dearly love, is made in Tokyo and Switzerland, for instance. Also, have you seen anything amazing lately? Movie, tv, or in life? I’d love to <a href=mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com>hear about it</a>. As always, stay safe, and keep fighting! I’ll see you next week space cowgirls~</p></div><div class=post-tags></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=tweet rel=me><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github rel=me><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>© 2020 by brook shelley</div></div></body></html>
