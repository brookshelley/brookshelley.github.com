Now, my house looks like this:</p><p><img src=/photos/plants.jpg alt></p><p>What happened?</p><h2 id=thanks-laurel>Thanks Laurel</h2><p>One year for Christmas, my roommate in Portland gave me a book and a single plant, and once I figured out how not to kill it, I got addicted to greenery.</p><p><img src=/photos/firstplant.jpg alt></p><p>I think it was the combination of cloudy skies, and an appreciation of the outdoors that Portland granted me which helped me change. I’d seen Laurel grow a few house plants, and reading <a href=https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/living-with-plants-by-sophie-lee/9781784880965>the book she gave me</a>, it seemed like a thing I could do too.</p><p><img src=/photos/plantbook.jpg alt></p><p>From the pothos I started with, I quickly expanded to a stag horn fern, and a few birds of paradise. I killed more than a few plants by overwatering the first few months of trying to understand how to plant though.</p><h2 id=moving-to-california>Moving to California</h2><p>When I moved to Oakland, I realized I wouldn’t be able to bring my plants with me. The thought of staring over with plants was daunting, but I found <a href=https://cactusjungle.com>Cactus Jungle</a> on the recommendation of a friend, and quickly set about picking up a few snake plants and pothos. Every time I visit that shop, I pick up a new plant, pot, or little gift for a friend. It’s a delightful place, with helpful staff and usually a bit of available street parking. A few of my plants even came from my pals Wonja and Dan as a very special and thoughtful housewarming gift.</p><p><img src=/photos/snorriandplant.jpg alt="snorri and plant"></p><h2 id=cats>Cats</h2><p>My main worry once I sorted out how to keep plants alive was whether or not Snorri would eat any of them and get sick. Not knowing a ton about plants, I was constantly googling and reading about non-toxic plants, often opting for 'this might make your cat throw up' when I couldn't find "chow down". Luckily, outside of a few very small snake plants (sansevieria trifasciata), he's largely uninterested in my plants. As long as I keep the ones he like to gnaw or bat at higher than he can reach, my plants and my cat seem to peacefully coexist.</p><p><img src=/photos/newpots.jpg alt="new plant pots"></p><h2 id=re-potting>Re-potting</h2><p>One thing I eventually learned is that plants don’t like being crowded in their pots. When the visible above-soil leaves look crowded, or they start to grow tall or long, often the roots underneath are super cramped. To fix this, I give my plants a new pot that’s significantly larger than before, with fresh soil. Usually, this means a mass shuffle, wherein I move 3-7 plants from smallest to largest after buying a big pot. I’ve even worked together with my friend Wonja to help repot particularly heavy or large snake plants on her back deck.</p><p>Usually, the easiest way to loosen the plant from the pot is just to reach your hand in and under, gently pulling it out. I then dust the soil off, and sometimes wash the roots a bit, then re-pot and add soil.</p><p>If you own a tarp, it might be a good idea to throw one down while you do this, or you’ll be doing quite a bit of sweeping afterwards.</p><p>Sometimes during this phase of plant life, I also split my plants up, propagating or relocating sections of the plan in a smaller pot. After you get an initial plant, outside of water, and occasional soil and fertilizer, these babies grow you new plants at no cost.</p><h2 id=quarantine>Quarantine</h2><p>With the COVID quarantine, there are days where it’s too challenging or stressful for me to go outside, but I learned when Laurel first introduced me to house plants that they really help make a house feel good. Now, even though I may be stuck inside due to smoke or disease, I can look around at a veritable forest of gorgeous plants. <a href=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/urban-mindfulness/200903/plants-make-you-feel-better>Studies</a> suggest that this plants are generally very positive for your mental and physical health. I still love when I can go to an actual forest, but when it’s not possible, I try to breathe and run my fingers over the leaves of my green pals.</p><p><img src=/photos/outsideplants.jpg alt="outside plants"></p><h2 id=future-plants>Future Plan(t)s</h2><p>At some point, I’d love to have birds of paradise again, and plants suspended from the ceiling—maybe spider plants? There’s a ton of vertical space in my apartment, and it could be very neat to have a small run of plants overhead. My courtyard outside already has a wealth of plant life, and I’ve added a few aloe plants to it, but I think once the out of doors is less dangerous, I might go ahead and spruce it up as well with a small table and perhaps a few more big plants.</p><p>If you’ve never been a fan of indoor plants, this might be the perfect time to find a small nursery or succulent shop nearby and stain your thumbs a bit green.</p></div><div class=post-tags></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=tweet rel=me><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github rel=me><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>© 2020 by brook shelley</div></div></body></html>
