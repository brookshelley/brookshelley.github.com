In July, I began sending <a href=https://dillandfennel.substack.com/p/weekly-links>weekly link emails</a>, which I managed to keep up through the end of the year. It&rsquo;s been quite a fun Sunday activity, so I thought I&rsquo;d chat a bit about what the experience of weekly link writing was like.</p><h2 id=why-links>Why links?</h2><p>This year I got really stoked about Robin Sloan&rsquo;s <a href=https://desert.glass>Year of the Meteor</a> newsletter, which was full of incredible links that led me to read quite a bit, and even <a href=https://underarmbalm.com>change my deodorant brand</a>. Robin consistently finds interesting and strange things all over the web, and I thought, perhaps I could do the same. I struggle to find writing topics at times, but I still journal daily, and try to keep up a writing practice during the fallow uninspired periods. A weekly newsletter seemed like an excellent idea, but I tend to write less, and not more.</p><h3 id=a-brief-digression>A brief digression</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve found that writers are usually in one of two camps: the underwriters, and the overwriters. As a member of the former camp, I can crank out 1-2000 words in no time, but asking me to go beyond that is a torture, whereas my overwriting friends tend to need an editor to get down to 2000. Because of this the idea of writing a novel, or even a longish short story is really hard to consider—but short creative nonfiction? Hell yes.</p><h2 id=ok-back-to-the-links>Ok, back to the links</h2><p>Having realized I wasn&rsquo;t able to creatively write every week without a good prompt, I settled on looking around the web through the week, and sending my baubles to you, the reader, on Sundays. I settled on Sunday because it felt like a good time to have coffee and enjoy a little surfing around. Perhaps you do this reading on another day, but for me, Sundays are for coffee and words.</p><h2 id=finding-links>Finding links</h2><p>The links I share come from all over the place. Sometimes I reshare things I found in another newsletter, like <a href=https://www.densediscovery.com>Dense Discovery</a>, and other times, they come from my <a href=https://feedbin.com>long list of RSS feeds</a> (feel free to request my OPML file). I read quite a bit every day, both on and offline, so it really isn&rsquo;t hard to find a few tidbits to share.</p><h2 id=the-satisfaction-of-analytics>The satisfaction of analytics</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about how many readers I&rsquo;ve accused (spoiler, not many), but I do love that I can see that folks generally <em>are</em> reading the emails I send out. There&rsquo;s a small sense of accomplishment when I know that someone has found something neat because I shared it. I really do love a recommendation, and it seems like some of you do as well.</p><h2 id=platforms>Platforms</h2><p>This year began on <a href=https://substack.com>Substack</a>, which seems like a decent platform, and has attracted <a href=https://www.shatnerchatner.com>more than</a> a <a href=https://grace.substack.com>few friends</a> as users. As someone who isn&rsquo;t really planning to find success or payment via a newsletter, my main goals were something easy to use, and ideally something I could send content to directly from <a href=https://ia.net/writer>iAWriter</a>, my markdown editor of choice.</p><p>With that in mind, I was eager to switch to <a href=https://buttondown.email>ButtonDown</a> after reading about it via Robin Sloan. I love how both the <a href="https://www.notion.so/639bdb37786e489a960d4810ee6ce351?v=58ef759254094357bdb04d715e9c518b">roadmap</a> and <a href=https://buttondown.email/running-costs>costs</a> are fully public, and the developer responds really quickly via email. This small, sustainable app is something I&rsquo;m really keen on supporting, as I love sustainable apps much more than venture-funded privacy-less hockey-stick comapnies. Plus using Working Copy and Shortcuts, I managed to build on top of their really <a href=https://api.buttondown.email/v1/schema>easy to use API</a>, and now have a one-button send draft to ButtonDown</p><h2 id=next-year>Next year</h2><p>My plan currently is to just <em>keep on keeping on</em> with this weekly links newsletter, and aspire to continuing monthly blog posts about longer topics. If you have things you&rsquo;d love to see, or things you want to chat about, you know <a href=mailto://brookshelley+blog@gmail.com>how to reach me</a>.</p><p>Have a fantastic new year, and I&rsquo;ll see you next Sunday!</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/process>process</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
