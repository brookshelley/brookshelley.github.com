Just in case you needed another reason to stay inside and wear a mask, dry thunderstorms have delivered. I donâ€™t know how you feel about this but itâ€™s pretty depressing and scary to me.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=https://t.co/ZmCjVZyNEV>pic.twitter.com/ZmCjVZyNEV</a></p>&mdash; Matt Haughey ðŸ˜· (@mathowie) <a href="https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/1296501978755997696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>Sorry to kick off with a bummer! I hope youâ€™re ok with occasionally being sad together before we dig into the joyful weirdness of links. Thanks friends.</p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><ul><li>Now that itâ€™s reached the end of an 8 year run, I can safely send you to the delightful series <a href=http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-1-title-page/>Oh Human Star</a>. Perhaps someone can share with me a good way of keeping track of your progress through a web comic, but Iâ€™ve been reading this via a manual updated bookmark for a while. Itâ€™s cool, itâ€™s queer, and Blue is a really nice human.</li><li>As a stock market player/money-haver who previously worries about having food to eat and electricity as a kid, itâ€™s very apparent to me how huge a gap there is between the rich and the poor. Hereâ€™s more about <a href=https://inthesetimes.com/article/stock-market-real-economy-disconnect-unemployment-poverty-coronavirus-trump>that horrific reality</a>. What if we all committed to addressing this wealth and economy gap in our lifetimes?</li><li>WOW, I hope you like uncontrollable bathroom problems! Remember Olestra? <a href=https://priceonomics.com/the-failure-of-the-fat-free-revolution/>Remember that whole nightmare?</a> I certainly do. For some reason (diet culture) my family was really into Wow chips, even once it was somewhat obvious that they were going though us like <a href=https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727278-tips-lose-weight-after-quarantine/>konjac</a>. Man, the 90s were weird.</li><li>Speaking of things I canâ€™t digest, albeit in this case delicious ones, why not try some <a href=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-so-cheese>ancient Japanese cheese?</a>. I <em>love</em> these culinary trips into history, especially when they actually look delicious. Beer recipes from thousands of years ago? Count me in! And yet, they still wonâ€™t let us <a href=https://allthatsinteresting.com/egyptian-sarcophagus-red-juice>drink the mummy juice</a>.</li><li>If, like me, youâ€™ve taken to reading during the quarantine you may have encountered <a href=https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/june/how-to-ignore-phone-while-reading-books.html>this roadblock</a>. Spoiler: itâ€™s your phone. IMO turn off all your notifications always, because if someone needs you theyâ€™ll call you. My friend <a href=http://helentseng.com>Helen</a> gave me <a href=https://phonebreakup.com>this book</a> a year or two ago, and it was pretty helpful in finding new ways to be a little more at peace with my devices.</li></ul><h2 id=in-closing>In closing</h2><p>Whatâ€™s one thing you want to do this week that makes you happy? For me, itâ€™s making rice pudding. I love rice pudding and Iâ€™ve never cooked it, so Iâ€™m pretty amped. Oh, and Iâ€™m baking more bread, obviously. I also <em>treated</em> myself to a game from my wish list: Farcry 5. Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s deeply strange and I canâ€™t wait to dive in.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you need me, please go fuck yourself <a href=https://t.co/8ewMMjYlTg>pic.twitter.com/8ewMMjYlTg</a></p>&mdash; Mark Mahoney (@markmahoney) <a href="https://twitter.com/markmahoney/status/1292569441465597952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>I hope whatever you do that brings you joy can capture your attention and heart for even a few minutes.
