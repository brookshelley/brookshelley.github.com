I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:</p><p><strong>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</strong></p><p>This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight. Family, rebellion, loss&hellip; ugh, I want to rewatch this right now.</p><p><strong>Black Panther</strong></p><p>Can you believe this came out in 2018? I got to see it in Oakland, and the crowd was dressed to the nines, and stoked AF about it. I saw Black Panther twice, and it’s the first super hero film in a while that made me smile and cheer throughout.</p><p><strong>Annihilation</strong></p><p>I loved this movie, for all that it didn’t hew to the book, and was bizarre. I’d loved the trilogy when I read it, but also enjoy Alex Garland’s films generally. I can’t say <em>why</em> I love this movie, but I do, and I saw it more than once.</p><p><strong>Sorry to Bother You</strong></p><p>I can’t say much about this indictment of capitalism and the gig-economy without spoiling it, but it’s excellent and you should go see it.</p><p><strong>Widows</strong></p><p>This movie felt like a dunk on the lackluster Oceans 8, and had everything I could want. The stakes were high, and even if it wasn’t the best at sustaining mystery, every woman in this film was outstanding.</p><p><strong>The Favourite</strong></p><p>Outstanding lesbian film. The humor in this movie was truly strange, and joyful. I feel like The Favourite came out of nowhere and blew me away, and except for a minor amount of rabbit-based fear, I was all the way here for it.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/movies>movies</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><ul class=flat><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley>newsletter</a></li><li><a href=/about>about</a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
