the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean
director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but
Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the
page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that&rsquo;s likely because
I devoted little time to reading. I&rsquo;m glad I finished this, and recommend
it if you love multi-layered, deftly-woven stories.</p><p><strong>Empire Ascendant</strong> — Kameron Hurley</p><p>A wild second installment in the Mirror Empire trilogy that is so
chock-full of characters and their (spoiler alert) doubles, that I got a
bit confused. There&rsquo;s a glossary and character list in the back, but dang,
this is some GoT stuff. I enjoyed the descent into chaos in this book, and
I&rsquo;m eagerly anticipating the conclusion(?) in the third. Also one of the
only books I know that has a character using ze/hir pronouns, but it also
unhelpfully talks about sex as different from and perhaps less malleable
than gender, so I wouldn&rsquo;t call this a &ldquo;dope representation of trans
folks,&rdquo; so much as &ldquo;well there&rsquo;s some genderqueerness I guess&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>Den of Thieves</strong></p><p>A heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop well. The plot was decently executed, but it&rsquo;s mostly just a movie with lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the couch.</p><p><strong>Masterminds</strong></p><p>A ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Sudekis. It&rsquo;s about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality physical comedy.</p><p><strong>Book Club</strong></p><p>Watched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great?
I love Candace Bergen from the Murphy Brown
days, and hope I look as good as Diane Keaton when I&rsquo;m older. Silly
popcorn fun. Also I guess I own it now because it wasn&rsquo;t available to rent.</p><p><strong>The Meg</strong></p><p>Wow. This is my new favorite sea-based movie. What an epically hilarious film.
A+ good job everyone.</p><p><strong>Mission Impossible Fallout</strong></p><p>A wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I
laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I
love this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and
passionately.</p><p><strong>Ready Player One</strong></p><p>I blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch. It was just
as bad as I thought it would be, but blessedly we could make good jokes
throughout.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/mediadiet>mediadiet</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
