Once I finish <a href=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/deborah-christian/mainline.htm>Mainline</a>, I can’t wait to dive into <a href=https://onezero.medium.com/william-gibson-takes-aim-at-the-silicon-valley-he-helped-create-in-an-exclusive-excerpt-of-agency-97c3604fbcde>Agency</a>. Maybe every generation has a real feeling of living in the future, but between tech news and world news, things are a little too reminiscent of sad cyberpunk. This is why I read fiction—at least there we can have heroes.</p><p>And now, the links:</p><ul><li>No family? If you’re in Japan, you can <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry>rent one</a>. I wonder if this would save me money on therapy, or leave me even more psychically confused?</li><li>Two sites I read have recently gone through a redesign (much like mine), and it’s fun to see how they <a href=https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/gardening-vs-architecture/>thought about it</a>. Even when the site update isn’t a bit overblown it can be <a href=https://www.animefeminist.com/the-great-anifem-makeover-is-here/>very interesting</a>.</li><li>In addition to redesigning our personal websites (you started blogging, right? It’s good for you), perhaps we should find other ways to <em><a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/opinion/world-wide-web.html>fix the web</a></em>.</li><li>One friend who blogs blessed us this week with a survey of the <a href=https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/579803.html>feral cats of their neighborhood</a>.</li><li>Finally, here’s <a href=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/essays/my-instagram/>a longer read about Instagram</a>. More than a few friends consider Instagram to be their nice, chill place online—a place for soothing images and creativity. I wish it had stayed that way for me, but alas, between ads, and folks aiming to take the exact same photo or get <em>really stoked</em> on exercise, I found it uncomfortable at best. For me, Slack is largely the place I see friend’s photos. I hope that at some point a non FB company will try to solve the friends + friends of friends photo sharing problem.</li></ul><p>This year I decided to upgrade my coffee at home a bit more than before, and my latest acquisition is all about <a href="https://www.hario.jp/seihin/productdetail.php?product=XGS-60TB">drinking coffee by the window</a> and reading books. Prior to this coffee server, I would drip directly into a Zojirushi vacuum thermos, but I prefer the look at ease of carrying that this brings. It’s never a bad idea to add a little class to one’s weekend, I think. On that note, I would encourage you to take a few deep breaths, and think about simple ways you can make your days off even more relaxing and delightful.</p><p>Enjoy your Sunday, and I’ll see you next week space cowgirls~</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/newsletter>newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
