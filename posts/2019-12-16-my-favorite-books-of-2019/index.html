Fortunately, most of them were pretty great, which made it even harder to pick out my five favorite. I gravitated towards a lot of fantasy and sci-fi in 2019 as a nice way to escape or even think about a potentially scarier future. My plan to keep reading primarily female authors also paid off.</p><p>In no particular order, here’s the list:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Starless Sea</strong> — Erin Morgenstern</p><p>Her first book was great, her second was outstanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Future of Another Timeline</strong> — Annalee Newitz</p><p>It’s wild that two of my favorite books this year came out near the end of the year. Newitz created a fascinating time-travel technology, with an amazing world. Here’s to the Daughters of Harriet.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Psychology of Time Travel</strong> — Kate Mascarenhas</p><p>More queer time travel? Hell yes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gideon the Ninth</strong> — Tamsyn Muir</p><p>Lesbian necromancers in space. Ok, there’s a theme to most of these and it’s around queer ladies and space or time-travel. I’m here for it, and so glad the whole zombie thing is over.</p></li><li><p><strong>Noumenon</strong> — Marina J. Lostetter</p><p>Multi-generational spaced exploration? Yes, please.</p></li></ul><p>I did more full-fledged reviews for each of these in the link at the start of this post, though as always my book and film reviews are short because I got my fill of analytical book essays in college.</p><h2 id=stand-out-comics>Stand-out comics</h2><ul><li>The whole X-Men relaunch! From Powers of X/House of X to the weekly series like X-Force, I’m stoked to be enjoying the X-Men again.</li><li>Paper Girls & Wicked and Divine: These two series finished strong, and I’m excited to read through them again sometime.</li><li>Die! An amazing series that’s just kicking off. This feels like a fresh take on D&D, so I’ll be glad to read more.</li><li>Shirokuma Cafe: the first series I can actually read in Japanese! This feels huge.</li></ul><h2 id=kindle-oasis>Kindle Oasis</h2><p>This year I read a few physical books, but by and large I read on my Kindle Oasis. In addition to being great for bathtub reading (hi Japan), the one-handed reading makes laying in bed super comfortable. Plus, I’ve found the Kindle to be a pretty solid place to read manga. I still hope that Amazon actually pushes the envelope on these at some point, but until then, I’ll hold onto this one. If you want to think more about ebooks, <a href=https://medium.com/@craigmod/reconsidering-the-hardware-kindle-interface-3c54088bed9e>this is a great essay</a>.</p><h2 id=2020>2020</h2><p>There are quite a few books in my queue for 2020, and I’m especially excited about a new William Gibson novel! I’ll likely travel a bit more, and as I start to finish up my big kanji learning project, I’ll be able to read more in Japanese as well.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/books>books</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=twitter rel=me><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github rel=me><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
