I
absolutely loved this. I&rsquo;m not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn&rsquo;t
listened to the podcast, but if you haven&rsquo;t, get on it&mldr; it&rsquo;s free and
it&rsquo;s delightful.</p><p><strong>La Bastarda</strong> — Trifonia Melibea Obono <a href=#les>*</a></p><p>A lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman
abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself
falling for another woman. The first half was full of build-up and
world-building, but the back half felt like a very rushed piece, as though
Trifonia was hoping to get it all out in a final effort. I enjoyed this
book, but the bits that were glossed over about Okomo&rsquo;s journeys, her
grandfather&rsquo;s death, and other scenes could&rsquo;ve been fleshed-out.</p><p><strong>Blackfish City</strong> — Sam J. Miller <a href=#ghost>**</a></p><p>This book ruled, and I was super surprised at how much I loved it.
Absolutely riveting, and a blast. The individual characters felt very
distict, and were easy to follow, and the world felt really interesting.</p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>Drive Angry</strong></p><p>There are probably worse Nic Cage movies, but this is the worst one I&rsquo;ve
seen. Every scene is painfully bad.</p><p><strong>Tomb Raider</strong></p><p>Fun, and very surprisingly entertaining for a video game movie. Lots of
&ldquo;oh, I could see how this would play in the game,&rdquo; scenes. Alicia Vikander
is a much better Lara Croft too, imo.</p><p><strong>Sorry to Bother You</strong></p><p>This is the movie Idiocracy wishes it were. Sorry to Bother You skewers
tech culture, bay-area poverty, racial injustice, and so much more.
Throughout, Tessa, Lakeith, and the rest of the cast deliver awesome
performances. A mix of chilling and laugh-inducing. One of the best films
I&rsquo;ve seen this year.</p><p><strong>Tragedy Girls</strong></p><p>What a wild, fucked-up movie about social media, murder, and friendship.
Don&rsquo;t do it for the gram.</p><p><strong>I, Tonya</strong></p><p>Finally watched this with a friend, and wow, it was good but full of very
violent abuse stuff. Growing up in the 80s/90s, Tonya Harding was in a lot
of news, but this definitely filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of her
story.</p><p><strong>Villainess</strong></p><p>What a wonderfully bonkers movie. It kicks off with wild first-person murder
fest, and just goes off-the-rails from there. One of the bloodier and wilder
action films I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. Loved it.</p><p><strong>The Incredibles 2</strong></p><p>Watched this a few hours after the first one. The animation has gotten a LOT
better, even though the first one honestly aged pretty well, since they didn&rsquo;t
try to make it photorealistic. The plot was ridiculous again, and they
definitely leaned hard into the &ldquo;men are bad at childcare&rdquo; shit that I
suspected they would. Fun enough though anyways.</p><p><strong>The Incredibles</strong></p><p>The animation holds up surprisingly well for a few year-old movie, even if
the plot depends on some pretty annoying misogynist tropes. I watched this
to prep for the new movie, and overall it was a fun, if ridiculous, movie.</p><p><strong>Ant Man & the Wasp</strong></p><p>This was a hoot. Very silly, and pretty PG, but above all else, this felt
like a comic movie. I&rsquo;d compare this to Spiderman Homecoming or a less
stylish Thor Ragnarok. Great summer night movie.</p><p><strong>Sicario</strong></p><p>What a wild movie, in which I needed to completely suspend all of my
feelings about America, the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; and Thanos. If you can attempt to
not emotionally connect to the actual monsters in this movie, it&rsquo;s kinda
fun in a &ldquo;tense film where things blow up&rdquo; kind of way.</p><p><strong>Gemini</strong></p><p>Lesbian murder mystery? Yes. This was fun, even if the music felt super
weird at times. Good bangs. Cool cars. A movie where men are the worst.
Also this seems consistent with the choices and habits of geminis, so, lol.
<em>shots fired</em>.</p><p><strong>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</strong></p><p>Lol, this movie was absurd. They rushed off the island and so many of the
subplots never really paid off? I can&rsquo;t forget that Pratt is a
conservative, and I didn&rsquo;t really care much about anyone in this film,
except for the dinosaurs. I guess I was rooting for the dinosaurs, and I
figure they probably came out ahead.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/mediadiet>mediadiet</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
