I hope wherever you are, you’re warm and feel loved.</p><h2 id=books>Books</h2><p><strong>The Starless Sea</strong> &ndash; Erin Morgenstern</p><p>I read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea. This is a book for those of us who love exploring, and digging into a fantastical tale.</p><p><strong>The Infinite Wait</strong> &ndash; Julia Wertz</p><p>My friend Jenny recommended this one a while ago, and I finally got around to reading it. I couldn’t put it down. It’s hilarious, sad, and very close to home. I’d never heard of Wertz until now, but I plan to immediately buy all her comics.</p><p><strong>The Future of Another Timeline</strong> — Annalee Newitz</p><p>Wow. This book was a triumph, and seriously seals Newitz as a scifi master. I only wish I could explore this world for longer. A perfect blend of history, speculation, and feminism—this book imagines a world in which collective action is possible deep into the past. Dang.</p><p><strong>How to Do Nothing</strong> — Jenny Odell</p><p>Now that I&rsquo;ve finally finished her book, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn&rsquo;t the self-help palp that so many books about your phone are, but instead a wildly revelatory piece on bioregionalism, art, mystery, and birds. So many cool birds. This is a book I had to sip, because every few pages were full of so many ideas I wanted to savor them. I learned quite a bit from Jenny in these pages, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. Don&rsquo;t worry if it takes you a while to read this, just buy a copy and meander through California through it.</p><p><strong>Shadow and Bone</strong> — Leigh Bardugo</p><p>This was a neat YA that ended far before I thought it would—my edition had almost 100 pages of previews after the book. I enjoyed the magic system, despite the unfortunate teen romance that tends to plague YA. I&rsquo;ll likely read more of this series, in hopes that it continues to build a cool world.</p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>Knives Out</strong></p><p>Sadly, I wasn&rsquo;t feeling great so I missed a bit of this, but I think I got all the important bits. I really want to see this again in the near future. The overall tone of the film was fantastic, and the comedic hits were delightful.</p><p><strong>Fast Color</strong></p><p>The preview of this movie had me hoping it was a potential adaptation of NK Jeminson&rsquo;s Broken Earth trilogy, but alas, it wasn&rsquo;t. Fortunately, it was still a fun movie about family and mutant powers. I wish there was a little more substance to the whole film, but on the upside, the mood was pretty interesting. Also it&rsquo;s weird seeing a belter as a sheriff (please see the Expanse for more details).</p><p><strong>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</strong></p><p>I’ve had this on my to-watch list for years, and finally decided to dive in. It was a beautiful and strange mediation on life, death, and family.</p><p><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate</strong></p><p>A nice return to form. This felt like a nice natural extension to Terminator 2, and while it wasn&rsquo;t a great film by any means, it was a fun romp with lots of goofy jokes, explosions, and Mackenzie Davis.</p><p><strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong></p><p>This was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the <a href=https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/485/>Incomparables</a>. I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/mediadiet>mediadiet</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
