I&rsquo;m you, but 16 years older, and hopefully a little wiser.</p><p>(Spoiler alert)</p><p>The next few years will be a lot of fun, but also really, really tough. You will lose friends and family to cancer, then to divorce and&hellip;</p><p>You transition. You finally do it, and it goes mostly ok! You don&rsquo;t talk to family anymore, but you probably saw that coming, and it&rsquo;s fine because you have friends who love and support you.</p><p>Your finances will get worse for a while. Really bad. You&rsquo;re going to spend a little while sleeping in your car and on folks&rsquo; couches. It sucks. You&rsquo;ll smoke too many cigarettes, and do some ridiculous stuff.</p><p>It works out.</p><p>Eventually, you get a job with folks who you really like, and they encourage you. You join a company that is doing amazing stuff with messaging (kind of like IRC, but way, way coolerâ€”you&rsquo;ll see). After a year, you get a little bit of stock, and finally pay off your student loan debt that you&rsquo;ll have ground down for 13 years. It will feel great.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll see a therapist, and a doctor, and a dentist with a regular cadence. It will help. I promise.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll love, you&rsquo;ll lose, and you&rsquo;ll get back on that horse. Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll do a <em>lot</em> of reading and spend a lot of time with your best friend, a cat named Snorri. You and Snorri will travel from Austin, to Portland, to Oakland, with a <em>ton</em> of flights in between to Europe, Asia, Canada, and NYC.</p><p>I know what it feels like a lot of nights right now. It sucks. It&rsquo;s real, and you&rsquo;ve had a hard time. Most people you know won&rsquo;t get it, and you deserve better. When you get older you&rsquo;ll know more people who&rsquo;ve also gone through a lot of shit, and they&rsquo;ll be good listeners, and you&rsquo;ll listen a lot too. Don&rsquo;t stop loving, and don&rsquo;t stop trying to be open with your friends. It pays off more often than not. Your biggest asset is your heart. Don&rsquo;t lose it.</p><p>I love you, and I can&rsquo;t wait for you to get to where I am now. For all the good times, and the bad ones, just know I&rsquo;m here in the future cheering you on.</p></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
