I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I&rsquo;ve accrued over the years.</p><p><img src=/photos/letterboxd.jpeg alt="favorite movies photo"></p><hr><h2 id=the-list>The List</h2><p>In no particular order, here are ten films that really stood out to me.</p><p><strong>‌Uncut Gems</strong></p><p>A real delight of failure and crushed dreams.</p><p><strong>Shoplifters</strong></p><p>A family of criminals gets to be perfectly human.</p><p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p><p>Nicole Kidman is a badass drunk detective.</p><p><strong>Us</strong></p><p>Under the boarrrrddddwalk. Boardwalk.</p><p><strong>Arctic</strong></p><p>Competence porn.</p><p><strong>Midsommar</strong></p><p>The best breakup film ever.</p><p><strong>The Farewell</strong></p><p>I cried quite a bit—major family feelings.</p><p><strong>First Reformed</strong></p><p>The world is getting hotter, and Ethan Hawke is too, inexplicably.</p><p><strong>Booksmart</strong></p><p>Cool buddy comedy with a talented younger cast.</p><p><strong>Parasite</strong></p><p>Eat the rich.</p><p>Honorable mention: Ford Vs. Ferrari.</p><h2 id=the-bad>The Bad</h2><p><strong>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker</strong></p><p>Look, I don&rsquo;t want to spoil this for anyone who cares, but has somehow not seen the film yet. I was super disappointed in how the series ended, and what a raw deal Rose got. Did we need <em>yet another droid</em>? It&rsquo;s particularly sad that with the Mandolorian really succeeding as a tv show, this is the pap we get in theaters. <a href=https://letterboxd.com/demiadejuyigbe/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/1/>Demi is better at tearing this apart than I am</a>.</p><p><strong>Predator</strong></p><p>Wow. Even as a fan of crap action films, this was a letdown.</p><p><strong>Hobbes &amp; Shaw</strong></p><p>Listen, I <em>love</em> the Fast &amp; Furious series like a warm blanket—it has cars, explosions, family, and little-to-no-complexity. Some of that was still present in this film, but they managed to hamstring the only female protagonist, and replace all the joy with ball jokes.</p><p><strong>Wandering Earth</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why I expected this to be great, but it was just hokey as hell.</p><p><strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong></p><p>I know, right? I hated the new Star Wars and the end of the Avenger&rsquo;s duology? I&rsquo;m obviously a monster. Unfortunately, this movie was much like Rise of Skywalker in that it mistook random scenes of characters folks recognize for a plot or joy. It takes more than seeing Spider-Man appear on screen for me to be excited these days—just look at the incredible Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse for tips on how to do this well. I think some plot lines do better in multiple comics, and not on the silver screen. Smaller, more fun superhero films in 2020, please.</p><h2 id=2019-streaming>2019 streaming</h2><p>Wow, 2019 was a great year for films! If you want to read longer reviews of the above films, visit my <a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/movies>movies page</a>. I didn&rsquo;t set out to watch more films this year, but with Amazon Prime, Criterion, Kanopy, iTunes, and Netflix, it was super easy to watch most of the stuff I wanted to see. I finally upgraded to a 4K TV and 4K Apple TV too, so I will likely watch even more things at my house without trekking to the land of empty cola machines and questionable curly fries.</p><hr><h2 id=2020>2020</h2><p>Looking towards next year, the films I&rsquo;m currently most excited about are:</p><p><strong>A Promising Young Woman</strong></p><p>Revenge films? Yes please.</p><p><strong>New Mutants</strong></p><p>One of the coolest X-Men teams ever, in the theater.</p><p><strong>No Time to Die</strong></p><p>I honestly love James Bond films, and I can&rsquo;t pretend otherwise.</p><p><strong>Monster Hunter</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why I love Resident Evil movies so much, but the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson has moved to a new video game adaptation has me stoked.</p><p><strong>Dune</strong></p><p>The David Lynch version of Dune, in all of its weirdness, was one of the movies I watched on repeat as a child. I know, that explains a lot, right? I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the subject matter. The spice must flow!</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/movies>movies</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><ul class=flat><li><a href=/about>about</a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
