I had some pals by yesterday to sit at a distance in my courtyard and when the last one went home, I fell right asleep. It‚Äôs such a nice thing to see friends right now, especially when you can share some wine and lots of laughs.</p><p>This week is a mix of weird and sad as usual. I‚Äôm working on some longer form posts for brookshelley.com in the coming week about backpacking and mechanical keyboards, so keep your eyes peeled for those too.</p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><ul><li>What if environmentalism but also <a href=https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/06/26/the-big-green-lie/>racist and xenophobic</a>? Unsurprisingly the global north doesn‚Äôt want to talk about our role in destroying the planet through unreasonable use of resources. It‚Äôs just so much easier to blame the ‚Äúother‚Äù of the global south for having children, or daring to build industry. The sooner we see Earth as a planet we all need to share equally, the better in my mind.</li><li>Speaking of resources, I watched quite a bit of the TV show Alone over the past few weeks in preparation for a <em>podcast</em> and I wondered, ‚Äúhow easy would it be for them to harvest salt from the ocean to season their dang food?‚Äù The answer, it turns out, is both <a href=https://www.outdoorrevival.com/instant-articles/harvesting-salt-from-the-ocean-a-great-skill-to-learn.html>not too hard</a>, and very challenging to do in a survival situation. I super hope on some season someone becomes a master of seasoning.</li><li>If you were a kid in the 80s, you might remember these fantastic toys from MASK, and apparently huge dead stock crates still exist of them:</li></ul><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Amazing warehouse find of sealed cased <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MASK?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MASK</a> toys in Antofagasta, Chile.

Honestly, bootleg toys are super weird and cool. I fondly remember shopping at dollar stores and shitty grocery stores that mostly stocked these knock-offs. If you‚Äôre still a fan of Transformers, like I know my friend Justin is, you might enjoy looking at <a href=http://www.transrepro.com/>these reproduction parts</a> made by a guy with a passion for recreation. The world of toys is&mldr; something I try to avoid spending money on, but it‚Äôs certainly tempting to help 35 year-old Brook live the dreams of poor kid Brook.</li><li>Do you like cats? Do you like poems? Here‚Äôs some very old Chinese poems from a person who hired a cat to kill his pests, and ended-up as we all do, falling in love:</li></ul><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>decided to do a separate thread for this so here we go: how Song dynasty poet Lu You poem-liveblogged his descent from cat owner to cat slave 800 years ago<br><br>The year is 1183.

I am writing this conclusion while I watch the Belgian Grand Prix, grateful that F1 has managed to race despite not having a <em>bubble</em>. This week was long, but next week I‚Äôm on <em>vacation</em>! I‚Äôm excited, even if I don‚Äôt get to do much outdoor adventuring due to the smoke that blankets so much of California right now. I hope you too get to take a vacation soon‚Äîyou deserve it. For now though, stay safe, keep fighting and I‚Äôll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p></div><div class=post-tags></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=tweet rel=me><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github rel=me><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>¬© 2020 by brook shelley</div></div></body></html>
