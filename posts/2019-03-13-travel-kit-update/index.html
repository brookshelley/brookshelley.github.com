Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I&rsquo;ve owned, but due to its size, I don&rsquo;t like hauling it around all day. I hoped that the DSPTCH bag would work really well during day to day travel, and it probably would have if it hadn&rsquo;t rained every day. The waist bag isn&rsquo;t waterproof (boo), or particularly comfortable for long stretches (double boo), due to the one shoulder setup. I wear the Waist Bag to work almost every day, but for way less time, so I&rsquo;d forgotten how little continual stress my left shoulder can take. Also, I learned that with <a href=https://www.arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/codetta-coat>my rain coat</a> on, the bag slides up uncomfortably against my neck, so next time I&rsquo;ll need a day backpack again. Most days, I chose not to bring a bag to avoid this discomfort. I hauled my LAMY Safari pen + a <a href=https://www.jetpens.com/Hobonichi-Techo-Weeks/ct/4399>Hobonichi Weeks</a>, my phone, and some tissue paper, so a bag was overkill mostly.</p><h2 id=two-jackets>Two jackets</h2><p>I took my Arcteryx coat to Japan, and it served me well, despite being a <em>little</em> tight. However, I wandered into a Snow Peak store early in the trip, and my friend Sarah and the shopkeeper convinced me to try on a steeply discounted <a href="https://snowpeak.com/collections/outerwear-1/products/jk-18au004-fr-rain-trench?variant=13074792972386">Japanese XL <em>fire resistant</em> jacket</a>. It fit like a charm, and was long enough to easily cover my knees so I could stay warm and dry in the constant rain. I alternated between the two coats through the rest of the wet trip, but with both in my RYU bag, there wasn&rsquo;t much room for other stuff. I never plan on buying much in Japan, and certainly not clothes, so this was a pleasant surprise. As a back-up, I had a packable Baggu tote, but I never had to resort to carrying stuff in the tote on the way home. If I were traveling to a rainy area again, I&rsquo;d only bring one coat, and which one would depend on how much layering I needed to do. It&rsquo;s kinda nice to have options.</p><h2 id=just-enough-space>Just enough space</h2><p>By the end of my trip the RYU bag was a <em>tight</em> zip. I bought two manga tankoban, and one Japanese novel, as well as a series of gachapon souvenirs, <a href=https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2015/05/japanese-lucky-charms-the-guide-to-omamori/>omamori</a>, and a load of Vick&rsquo;s lozenges because of my cold. Everything fit, along with my two jackets, but only <em>just</em> so. I wore my DSPTCH bag on the front, outside of the RYU to get on the plane or train, but I could stuff it in if I needed to.</p><h2 id=planned-changes>Planned changes</h2><p>Next trip, if the weather is similar, my plan is to bring one jacket, and not buy another. Additionally, two pairs of pants was really beneficial, but <a href=http://www.coalatree.com/collections/kachula/products/trailhead-adventure-pant>a new pair I bought</a> should pack better than <a href=https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nike-nikelab-x-mmw-womens-pants/4796841>the Nike pants</a> I brought, so that will save some space. My <a href=http://www.goby.co/products/electric-toothbrush-all-black>new toothbrush</a> worked swimmingly, and I didn&rsquo;t bring a charger, since my trip was ~2 weeks. I brought just enough toiletries, and that felt nice. I wish I&rsquo;d brought a tank top to sleep in, as I only had two shirts, so I felt like one was always a little funky from sleep, but because they wick, it was alright. For a daypack, I might look for an ultralight packable daypack, like one from Matador or <a href="http://www.ynotmade.com/en/shop/splitshift/?sku=5808">YNOT</a>, but my Topo Designs bag is probably good enough.</p><h2 id=next-trip>Next trip</h2><p>Next time I fly, it’s a short trip to Portland for a conference I’m doing a talk at with some friends. Two days means I’ll bring my Oppose This bag, and have a chill, easy time. Hopefully I’ll get to go back to Japan later this year and test this whole load-out again.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/travel>travel</a></li><li><a href=/tags/backpacks>backpacks</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
