A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It&rsquo;s also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.</p><p><strong>Invasions</strong> — Calvin Gimpelevich</p><p><a href=_posts/2018-10-14-invasions-review.md>My review</a>. TL;DR it was great. Buy it.</p><p><strong>Love &amp; Estrogen</strong> &ndash; Samantha Allen</p><p>I don&rsquo;t usually read trans memoir&ndash;and I have a forthcoming piece that challenges and lampoons it to a degree&ndash;but Samantha is a friend and her story is close to my heart because of that. I had the chance to chat with her a lot through the course of part of this love and transition story, and I enjoyed the way she told it. This memoir definitely touched on some of the tropes of the genre, but by also being a wonderful love story, it manages to eschew many more.</p><p><strong>The Tea Master &amp; the Detective</strong> &ndash; Aliette de Bodard <a href=#ghost>**</a></p><p>This was a fun detective tale with a mysterious Sherlock and a spaceship Watson. The setup never quite paid off with its mystery, but I look forward to reading more hooks in the series. I also worried a bit that it would fetishize or exoticize Chinese culture, but outside of the space-protection tea, it largely doesn&rsquo;t come up.</p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>Halloween</strong></p><p>A spooky throwback to get ready for the sequel. I guess they made a bunch of these and they were all garbage, and the new movie aims to erase them. I <em>think</em> somehow the only one I&rsquo;d seen was Season of the Witch, which is the 3rd movie in the original set. The 70s were a weird time, and the amount of nudity random &ldquo;gotta take my clothes off&rdquo; is just yikes. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job. I&rsquo;m hoping the pacing of the new film is more up to modern standards though, because dang, did this feel dated and slow in a lot of ways.</p><p><strong>Hotel Artemis</strong></p><p>From the preview, I assumed this would be a John Wick knockoff, but it was fun in its own right. Lots of action, Jenny Slate, and a wide array of solid actors. The future is a dismal one, but hey, that checks out.</p><p><strong>Beirut</strong></p><p>What if John Hamm&rsquo;s Mad Men character was a state department guy turned negotiator? 70s Beirut is a trip in the way it&rsquo;s presented, and knowing a little history, this seems like a wild but semi-accurate portrayal of all the folks who fought over Lebanon during and after the civil war. This is a tonally dark political thriller, and I dug it.</p><p><strong>Venom</strong></p><p>What a perfectly odd anti-hero film. I was a big Venom fan as a kid, and this movie delivered everything I wanted in a Venom movie. Fuck the haters, this is a hoot. I don&rsquo;t think this should win any prizes for <em>cinema</em> but it&rsquo;s fun, and provided lots of awkward laughs. The action was exciting, and I can&rsquo;t wait for a sequel full of <em>carnage</em>.</p><p><strong>Sicario: Day of the Solado</strong></p><p>Another ridiculous action film about &ldquo;the cartels&rdquo; that I can&rsquo;t honestly tell is meant to make folks dislike the US or root for us. If you want to watch Cable/Thanos run around and shoot things, this is probalby a good movie for you. I don&rsquo;t find these very clever, but mostly I wish we got an Equalizer-style movie focused on Benecio Del Toro&rsquo;s character. While I&rsquo;m hoping, perhaps Demián Bichir can be in the third movie.</p><p><strong>Mandy</strong></p><p>A weirdo pyschadelic mess of a movie. I hate that a woman&rsquo;s death is used as a catalyst, but beyond that this is a bloody, ridiculous revenge flick. The music is great throughout and perhaps we were all delirious, but my theater laughed quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Dawn of the Dead</strong> (2004/Rewatch)</p><p>I could watch this every year. This is an excellent remake of an excellent zombie film. Everyone gives their all, and so many of the deaths, kills, and twists are perfect. A+ work from before Zach Snyder made cruddy films.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/mediadiet>mediadiet</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
