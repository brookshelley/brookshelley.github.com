# My Favorite Albums of 2019

## The Playlist

[Here's all the albums I really loved this year](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/favorites-of-2019/pl.u-vp3jjIrk0xN) easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.

## The Albums

1) **Cheap Queen** — King Princess
  Bless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.
2) **Emily Alone** — Florist
  A deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.
3) **Interloper** — Momma
  Just the right amount of harmonies and hooks to draw you into a strange and fun indie rock band.
4) **Family Tree** — Oh Land
  A gorgeous album from a Danish former dancer. I just love her voice—from the start the album has a haunting beauty.
5) **Scholars** — Buke & Gase
  I've had every album Buke & Gase put out on repeat for some time after their release, and dearly love their jangly, angular rock. This album doesn't disappoint.
6) **Beast on Beast** — Gabby's World
  This is the first band I've listened to that has gone through three name changes, from Eskimeaux, to Ó, then finally Gabby's World. I've loved them the whole time, and find this to be especially good sad subway music for when you're a little bummed and riding home at night.
7) **Placeholder** — Hand Habits
8) **Memory Streams** — Portico Quartet
  I first heard this band at a vinyl bar in Oakland, and their latest album rules.
9) **Trust In The Lifeforce Of The Deep Mystery** — The Comet Is Coming
10) **Nowhere Now Here** — MONO
11) **Patience** — Manequin Pussy
12) **Crush on Me** — Sir Babygirl
13) **Miss Universe** — Nilüfer Yanya
14) **Hifalutin** — Lowly
15) **Weird** — Juliana Hatfield
16) **Fibs** — Anna Meredith
17) **Four of Arrows** — Great Grandpa
