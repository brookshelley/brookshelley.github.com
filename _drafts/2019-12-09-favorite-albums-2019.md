# My Favorite Albums of 2019

## The Playlist

[Here's all the albums I really loved this year](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/favorites-of-2019/pl.u-vp3jjIrk0xN) easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.

## The Albums

1) **Cheap Queen** — King Princess

  Bless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.

2) **Emily Alone** — Florist

  A deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.

3) **Interloper** — Momma

  Just the right amount of harmonies and hooks to draw you into a strange and fun indie rock band.

4) **Family Tree** — Oh Land

  A gorgeous album from a Danish former dancer. I just love her voice—from the start the album has a haunting beauty.

5) **Scholars** — Buke & Gase

  I've had every album Buke & Gase put out on repeat for some time after their release, and dearly love their jangly, angular rock. This album doesn't disappoint.

6) **Beast on Beast** — Gabby's World

  This is the first band I've listened to that has gone through three name changes, from Eskimeaux, to Ó, then finally Gabby's World. I've loved them the whole time, and find this to be especially good sad subway music for when you're a little bummed and riding home at night.

7) **Placeholder** — Hand Habits

  A complex jam album with fantastic guitars and vocals weaving in and out of downtempo songs.

8) **Memory Streams** — Portico Quartet

  I first heard this band at a vinyl bar in Oakland, and their latest album rules.

9) **Trust In The Lifeforce Of The Deep Mystery** — The Comet Is Coming

  Fantastic end of the world music. This is really strange, funky jazz, and I dig it. Many mornings start off with this album and some coffee.

10) **Nowhere Now Here** — MONO

  I've been stoked on MONO since high school, and was lucky enough to see them perform many times at Emo's (RIP) in Austin. They just keep on making fantastic music that vacillates softer beautiful sounds and driving melodies. Whether you're walking around the city or taking a train to another city, this album creates a gorgeous soundtrack for your life.

11) **Patience** — Manequin Pussy

   A chill mix of punk and indie rock jams. I think I first saw this band at a show/benefit for Bernie Sanders that I didn’t know was a benefit. It was a super washed crowd, but Manequin Pussy owned bones. This record rules.

12) **Crush on Me** — Sir Babygirl

   I’m really enjoying the new influx of queer and lesbian pop music these days. This album is infectiously catchy and often hilarious. Put it on and enjoy the short bouts of sun this winter.

13) **Miss Universe** — Nilüfer Yanya

  I'm not sure how to describe this album, but it's a jam. A bit of r&b, a bit of indie rock, and a lot of really solid tunes. I've put this album on a repeat a few times this year.		

14) **Hifalutin** — Lowly

  

15) **Weird** — Juliana Hatfield

16) **Fibs** — Anna Meredith

17) **Four of Arrows** — Great Grandpa
