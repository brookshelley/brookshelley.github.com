# Media diet for November

It’s finally chilly hygge-weather in the Bay Area, so I’ve been reading a lot after returning from a long trip to Japan. I hope wherever you are, you’re warm and feel loved.

## Books

**The Starless Sea** -- Erin Morgenstern

I read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea. This is a book for those of us who love exploring, and digging into a fantastical tale.

**The Infinite Wait** -- Julia Wertz

My friend Jenny recommended this one a while ago, and I finally got around to reading it. I couldn’t put it down. It’s hilarious, sad, and very close to home. I’d never heard of Wertz until now, but I plan to immediately buy all her comics.

**The Future of Another Timeline** — Annalee Newitz

Wow. This book was a triumph, and seriously seals Newitz as a scifi master. I only wish I could explore this world for longer. A perfect blend of history, speculation, and feminism—this book imagines a world in which collective action is possible deep into the past. Dang.

**How to Do Nothing** — Jenny Odell

Now that I've finally finished her book, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn't the self-help palp that so many books about your phone are, but instead a wildly revelatory piece on bioregionalism, art, mystery, and birds. So many cool birds. This is a book I had to sip, because every few pages were full of so many ideas I wanted to savor them. I learned quite a bit from Jenny in these pages, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. Don't worry if it takes you a while to read this, just buy a copy and meander through California through it.

**Shadow and Bone** — Leigh Bardugo

This was a neat YA that ended far before I thought it would—my edition had almost 100 pages of previews after the book. I enjoyed the magic system, despite the unfortunate teen romance that tends to plague YA. I'll likely read more of this series, in hopes that it continues to build a cool world.

## Movies

**Fast Color**

**Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives**

I’ve had this on my to-watch list for years, and finally decided to dive in. It was a beautiful and strange mediation on life, death, and family. 

**Terminator: Dark Fate**

A nice return to form. This felt like a nice natural extension to Terminator 2, and while it wasn't a great film by any means, it was a fun romp with lots of goofy jokes, explosions, and Mackenzie Davis. 

**Edge of Tomorrow**

This was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the [Incomparables](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/485/). I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.
