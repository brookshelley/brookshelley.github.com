# Media diet for November

## Books

## Movies

**Edge of Tomorrow**

This was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the [Incomparables](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/485/). I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.
