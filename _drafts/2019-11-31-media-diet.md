# Media diet for November

It’s finally chilly hygge-weather in the Bay Area, so I’ve been reading a lot after returning from a long trip to Japan. I hope wherever you are, you’re warm and feel loved.

## Books

**The Future of Another Timeline** — Annalee Newitz

Wow. This book was a triumph, and seriously seals Newitz as a scifi master. I only wish I could explore this world for longer. A perfect blend of history, speculation, and feminism—this book imagines a world in which collective action is possible deep into the past. Dang.

**How to Do Nothing** — Jenny Odell

Now that I've finally finished her book, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn't the self-help palp that so many books about your phone are, but instead a wildly revelatory piece on bioregionalism, art, mystery, and birds. So many cool birds. This is a book I had to sip, because every few pages were full of so many ideas I wanted to savor them. I learned quite a bit from Jenny in these pages, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. Don't worry if it takes you a while to read this, just buy a copy and meander through California through it.

**Shadow and Bone** — Leigh Bardugo

This was a neat YA that ended far before I thought it would—my edition had almost 100 pages of previews after the book. I enjoyed the magic system, despite the unfortunate teen romance that tends to plague YA. I'll likely read more of this series, in hopes that it continues to build a cool world.

## Movies

**Edge of Tomorrow**

This was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the [Incomparables](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/485/). I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.
