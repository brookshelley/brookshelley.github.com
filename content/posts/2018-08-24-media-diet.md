## Books

**Fingersmith** — Sarah Waters

In an odd turn of fate, I'd seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so
the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean
director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but
Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the
page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that's likely because
I devoted little time to reading. I'm glad I finished this, and recommend
it if you love multi-layered, deftly-woven stories.


**Empire Ascendant** — Kameron Hurley

A wild second installment in the Mirror Empire trilogy that is so
chock-full of characters and their (spoiler alert) doubles, that I got a
bit confused. There's a glossary and character list in the back, but dang,
this is some GoT stuff. I enjoyed the descent into chaos in this book, and
I'm eagerly anticipating the conclusion(?) in the third. Also one of the
only books I know that has a character using ze/hir pronouns, but it also
unhelpfully talks about sex as different from and perhaps less malleable
than gender, so I wouldn't call this a "dope representation of trans
folks," so much as "well there's some genderqueerness I guess".

## Movies

**Den of Thieves**

A heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop well. The plot was decently executed, but it's mostly just a movie with lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the couch.

**Masterminds**

A ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Sudekis. It's about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality physical comedy.

**Book Club**

Watched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great?
I love Candace Bergen from the Murphy Brown
days, and hope I look as good as Diane Keaton when I'm older. Silly
popcorn fun. Also I guess I own it now because it wasn't available to rent.

**The Meg**

Wow. This is my new favorite sea-based movie. What an epically hilarious film.
A+ good job everyone.

**Mission Impossible Fallout**

A wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I
laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I
love this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and
passionately.

**Ready Player One**

I blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch. It was just
as bad as I thought it would be, but blessedly we could make good jokes
throughout.
