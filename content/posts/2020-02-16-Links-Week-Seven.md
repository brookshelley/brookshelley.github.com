First of all, look at this DUCK!

I’m writing this intro at my dining table, while someone cleans my house. Hiring a house-cleaner is one of the most awkward and also incredible things I’ve done in the past few years. I learned it’s a lot cheaper than I thought it would be—in Portland it cost 60 bucks a session. I haven’t figured out how to not feel like I’m in the way the whole time, or how to comfort Snorri, but at least my house is pretty damn clean for a few days.

It’s cloudy outside today, but I still plan to venture to a pop-up Yakitori thing put on by some pals at [鳥万
](https://www.instagram.com/torimancal/). Feeling hungry? Feast on these links:

- If you ever want to explore the fantastic electronics market of Shenzhen, [this guide is a must read](https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/essential/essential-guide-shenzhen-web.pdf). I've never been, but I've heard it handily beats out Akihabara for wacky and delightful electronic goods.
- While we're on the topic of China, this Chinese fashion designer blew me away with [this collection](https://coolhunting.com/style/penultimates-dazzling-diy-influenced-collection/). I love the utterly bizarre combination of patterns and body-horror.
- You probably saw this online this week, but this guy's daughter rocked the world with the creation of [long Chile and Ohio 2](https://twitter.com/craigcalcaterra/status/1227594895747141632?s=12).
- Oh, you don’t know [about squeakin’?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg4Dyx3XXDg)?!
- If you’ve ever talked to a person in tech, you may have heard, “you should learn to code. This refrain sometimes come from a good place, but also feels like “hey dumdum, just make a software!” I really like the way that Robin Sloan reframed it this week as: “learn to be a home cook”. We usually don’t learn how to cook so we can open a Michelin-started restaurant, but instead so we can feed ourselves. [What does this look like when the oven is computers?](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)
- If you’re a podcast fan, perhaps some of the shows you love are celebrating ten years of recording. One of my favorites is the extremely nerdy [The Incomparables](https://overcast.fm/+kMZLu2m8). Every episode is a discussion of comics, movies, books, or something equally nerdy. There are lots of drafts, and I have genuinely enjoyed laughing along with them since 2010. MBMBAM will also hit 500 soon. Feeling a little old, lol.

I hope you enjoyed today's whirlwind tour of _links_. The cleaning is still going on here near the IKEA, and I'm getting peckish. Tomorrow is a holiday here, luckily, and I plan to do very little. I hope you have a long weekend too, and tomorrow will be a day of rest and relaxation. See you next week, space cowgirls~
