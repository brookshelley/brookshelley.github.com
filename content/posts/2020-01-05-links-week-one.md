# Links: Week One

It’s 2020! Welcome to the new decade. Imagine for a moment the news hasn’t already been wild, and step into a this list of joy and edutainment instead. A lot of links this week are to older projects for folks I’ve mentioned before, because I just got back from a long holiday of reading and watching things on tv, so I rediscovered some old favorites. I also redesigned [my website](https://www.brookshelley.com), and moved it from Jekyll to Hugo, which meant some painful time with Go templating. Yikes.

Without further ado, release the links!

- My friend Andy ran another conference before the delightful XOXO, and the talks are still archived for your edification. [This one from Robin Sloan](https://vimeo.com/63008757) is a delight. From a different year of build, [Craig Mod talks about books](https://vimeo.com/33919422) and their future. 2019 was a banner year for both of their newsletters, and if you haven’t seen them, here’s [Craig’s](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/) and here’s [Robin’s](https://desert.glass).
- If you enjoyed watching Craig Mod’s talk, and you want to read more, his [work on ebooks holds up well](https://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/). As a person who reads every day on a Kindle, I have hope that perhaps the love of text and reading experience will one day fully enter the digital realm. Until then, I’ll keep vacillating between books and ebooks.

- During the break I picked up a rad re-release of a classic manga called [“The Walking Man”](https://www.greenapplebooks.com/book/9781912097364), and it’s both gorgeous and delightfully banal. The book is mostly about a man walking quietly through urban Japan. That’s it. Sometimes he climbs trees.
- During the holiday I also got to spend a lot of time with my friend Julian, who writes [excellent short fiction](https://maudlinhouse.net/i-am-a-beautiful-bug/) and a column about [gender and food](https://entropymag.org/the-care-and-feeding-of-your-sex-change-dan-ortberg-discusses-the-important-matter-of-soup/). We ate quite a bit of food, and rang in the new year at a party where everyone wore wigs. A+ would hang out again.

All right, thanks for reading along, and being part of my [newsletter journey over this last year](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-30-what-i-learned-from-sending-a-newsletter-this-year/). If you’re still hungry for more newsletter _content_, I recommend learning about life and birds with [Morgane, the night heron](https://tinyletter.com/night_heron).

See you next week, space cowgirls~
