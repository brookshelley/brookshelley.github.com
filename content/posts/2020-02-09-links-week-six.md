**Shochu, CSS, and “enough”**

This week marked the inaugural [Figma conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL_ruBAwVmo), which I was able to attend through my employer. It was neat to be surrounded by designers from all over the world, and think about how to solve bigger problems than just “how to make people click”. 

I also got to meet up with [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/roden/035/) of hiking, ebook, and Leica writing renound—he’s a delight. At a certain point in life I realized most of the people I dig know each other, so it wasn’t a surprise he knew the [Andys](https://waxy.org/) and [Patrick](https://twitter.com/hoverbird). We got to talk about the realities of living in Japan as a white American, as well as creating our own families outside of the heteronormative frame.

Overall, it was a nice week. How was yours? Reply if you feel like sharing.

And now, the links:

- Remember [the time before CSS](https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/)? The simple text-mostly world of blue underlined and tables? This is the internet I cut my teeth on, and learned how to code into. 
- In the world of tech and productivity, everyone is pushing harder and harder to get more done. What if instead of efficiency, we looked [towards _sufficiency_](https://www.treehugger.com/energy-efficiency/forget-efficiency-it-time-get-serious-about-sufficiency.html)? 
- On the same note, this article is a meditation on [having enough](https://pjrvs.com/enough). 
- If you’ve been outside in the states at all, you’ve likely noticed the preponderance of huge, lumbering SUVs in the past two decades. [Vice dug into why they exist](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7q7eb/electric-or-not-big-suvs-are-inherently-selfish), and I have a feeling you won’t be surprised much by who drives them. 
- Need something to watch? This week I saw [The Stranger](https://www.netflix.com/title/80187302) on Netflix, with Richard Armitage from a very good season of Spooks, and [Mystic Quest: Raven’s Banquet](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/07/apple-tv-plus-mythic-quest-now-available/).

Whether or not you’re celebrating the annual chocolate and mistake-a-thon that Valentine’s Day is, I hope you treat yourself to something nice to drink or eat. See you next week space cowgirls~
