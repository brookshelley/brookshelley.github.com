Greetings from the tail-end of a vacation week for your hostess. I celebrated my birthday on Thursday with a couple friends, a couple bottles of wine, 5lbs of mashed potatoes, and 6' of distance.

A strange year, but thus far 36 is a good one. 

Friday saw those friends, save one who took care of Snorri, going on a long backpacking hike to camp near Cache Creek in -1C conditions. BRR!

It was a seriously good time, but also I'm completely destroyed as I write this on Saturday night.

How was your weekend?

Let's hit the links!

## Links

- Have you ever wanted to see inside some cute creatures? I didn't even know I wanted to, but these x-rays from the Oregon Zoo were a delight:

- I've loved the two albums by Adrianne Lenker (better known for her work leading Big Thief), and this Tiny Desk concert was no exception:

- Remember when Fiona Apple dropped her latest album, and everyone wondered who Shameika was? It turns out she's a [very talented and rad lady](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/fiona-apple-shameika-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-interview/). I love that their former teacher reconnected them, and that Shameika showed a little kindness to a shy, scared girl in school.
- Thought about "doing a blog", but you don't want to use Squarespace or really think too much about it? Especially if you're interested in something *like* Tumblr, but not ruined, check these two out: [blot.im](https://blot.im) and [tray.club](https://tray.club).
- - It's never a bad time to go visit [McMansion Hell](https://mcmansionhell.com/post/635435396215521280/we-interrupt-this-broadcast-to-bring-you-an).  I don't want to spoil it, but I love "bad vibes core".
- Don't miss the McMansion Hell writer's great article on [weird minimalist decorating.](https://hyperallergic.com/566183/how-normie-minimalism-and-farmhouse-chic-took-over-contemporary-design/)

## Closing

I'm wiped! I think I might be in bed before 1am tonight, which is rare. Are you reading anything cool, or watching anything good? [Let me know](mailto:newsletter@brookshelley.com)

I hope you enjoy your Sunday, stay safe, and keep learning and loving, space cowgirls~
