# Fennel and carrot soup

This soup is _fall as fuck_. Happy October!

## Ingredients

(You can obviously customize this a bit, so I encourage experimentation) 

- One or two bulbs of fennel 
-A few (6-10) carrots 
- 3-4 bell peppers 2-4 sliced tomatoes 
- Half an apple 
- Salt and Pepper to taste 
- a bit of Rosemary 
- some fennel bits (?) what are the leaves/green things called? 
- 1 tablespoon of Shio koji 
- a tablespoon of miso 
- 3-a lot of garlic cloves 
- 1-3 chopped green onions

## Directions

Roast sliced fennel, carrots, and bell peppers in the oven at 400 degrees with olive oil for 40 minutes.

Add the roasted veg to a pot along with the oil they were roasted in with enough water to cover and a bit more (like 1 to 2 liters of water).

Add tomato and apple.

Bring to a low boil.

Add rosemary and fennel bits.

Sauté the onions and garlic to bring out the aroma.

Add them to the pot.

Use an immersion blender or a big ‘ol blender to make the soup into a silky texture.

Add shio koji, mix in some miso, and salt an pepper to taste.

Cook on a simmer until thickened to your desired level.

Serve with chopped almonds or walnuts, or with some nice olive oil toast.

It’s... good.
