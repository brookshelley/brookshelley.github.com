It’s been a rough week for so many folks I love due to police violence and a Friday rollback of national trans healthcare. I hope you’re taking care of yourself, and your loved ones. Reach out, and stick together, even if we’re far away from each other. 

I’ll keep sending out these link emails every week though, as I think it’s important to read and see things that can surprise, delight, or teach us even as we mourn and fight.

## Links

- I wish William Gibson was a little less prescient sometimes. [This interivew](https://thequietus.com/articles/28340-william-gibson-agency-interview) with the author talks about his latest work, and the eeriness of his writing about “the jackpot”. I recently reread Gibson’s Blue Ant trilogy, which was coincident with a growth in stealth brands, surveillance culture, and AR. I think it will ultimately hold up a bit better for me than the Peripheral or Agency, but it’s nice to see him still so masterfully creating fiction.

> Corners of the internet continue to operate slowly.

- I posted [a link](http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html) last week that [this article](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/on-observing-time/) led me to. I really appreciate the idea of going a little slower online, and hope that this series of links every week is part of that.

- With some good music queued up, let’s read about [slow software](https://craigmod.com/essays/software_slump/). I don’t agree with everything Craig concludes here, but I appreciate his digging into what makes software good and bad, and the thread he started of software folks enjoy. I sincerely hope that WWDC in two weeks brings ARM chips to the Mac, and with it, better speed and battery life. Times are rough in so many ways, but there’s still a surprising amount of interesting technology being released and neat software to play around with too.
- Gretchen McCullouch chronicled her experience with the [Wired Style Guide](https://the-toast.net/2015/08/26/wired-style-a-linguist-explains-vintage-internet-slang/) for the Toast a few years before [her book](https://gretchenmcculloch.com/book/) launched. Reading this took me way back to the earlier days of the internet in a similar fashion to the book [Lurking](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470007-1/joanne-mcneil-discusses-lurking). In a lot of ways, I think I miss the time where sites were static, and the social net was IRC, forums, and email. I’m curious to see what the next ten years looks like: what is Web 4.0? Web 10.0? 
- On Friday, I wrote about my [newfound love for the tv show Survivor](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-12-stoked-on-survivor/). It’s a very silly show, but powering through seasons is giving me a lot of joy right now.

What is bringing you joy lately? Baking? Pets? The idea that we can have more police-free autonomous zones? [Let me know](mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com). I’ll be biking a bit this weekend to enjoy the blue skies in the bay, so if you see me _wave at a distance_ and be sure to take care of yourself too. The best way to fight state violence is starting with sleep, water, and love for each other that they can’t take from us. Stay safe, stay strong, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~
