# Dill & Fennel 8-23-20

Ah, breathe deep the fires of California. Just in case you needed another reason to stay inside and wear a mask, dry thunderstorms have delivered. I don’t know how you feel about this but it’s pretty depressing and scary to me.

Sorry to kick off with a bummer! I hope you’re ok with occasionally being sad together before we dig into the joyful weirdness of links. Thanks friends.

## Links

* Now that it’s reached the end of an 8 year run, I can safely send you to the delightful series [Oh Human Star](http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-1-title-page/). Perhaps someone can share with me a good way of keeping track of your progress through a web comic, but I’ve been reading this via a manual updated bookmark for a while. It’s cool, it’s queer, and Blue is a really nice human.
* As a stock market player/money-haver who previously worries about having food to eat and electricity as a kid, it’s very apparent to me how huge a gap there is between the rich and the poor. Here’s more about [that horrific reality](https://inthesetimes.com/article/stock-market-real-economy-disconnect-unemployment-poverty-coronavirus-trump). What if we all committed to addressing this wealth and economy gap in our lifetimes?
* WOW, I hope you like uncontrollable bathroom problems! Remember Olestra? [Remember that whole nightmare?](https://priceonomics.com/the-failure-of-the-fat-free-revolution/) I certainly do. For some reason (diet culture) my family was really into Wow chips, even once it was somewhat obvious that they were going though us like [konjac](https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727278-tips-lose-weight-after-quarantine/). Man, the 90s were weird.
* Speaking of things I can’t digest, albeit in this case delicious ones, why not try some [ancient Japanese cheese?](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-so-cheese). I *love* these culinary trips into history, especially when they actually look delicious. Beer recipes from thousands of years ago? Count me in! And yet, they still won’t let us [drink the mummy juice](https://allthatsinteresting.com/egyptian-sarcophagus-red-juice).
* If, like me, you’ve taken to reading during the quarantine you may have encountered [this roadblock](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/june/how-to-ignore-phone-while-reading-books.html). Spoiler: it’s your phone. IMO turn off all your notifications always, because if someone needs you they’ll call you. My friend [Helen](http://helentseng.com) gave me [this book](https://phonebreakup.com) a year or two ago, and it was pretty helpful in finding new ways to be a little more at peace with my devices.

## In closing

What’s one thing you want to do this week that makes you happy? For me, it’s making rice pudding. I love rice pudding and I’ve never cooked it, so I’m pretty amped. Oh, and I’m baking more bread, obviously. I also *treated* myself to a game from my wish list: Farcry 5. I’ve heard it’s deeply strange and I can’t wait to dive in.

I hope whatever you do that brings you joy can capture your attention and heart for even a few minutes. As always, stay safe and keep fighting, space cowgirls~.
