Trying out a new name for this that isn’t just “links”. Fennel and dill are two of my favorite flavors, but also a terrible combination. They also happen to be my utterly bizarre chest-piece tattoo. If you follow this newsletter but haven’t ever met me in person, just know I have a _lot_ of botanical tattoos. 

My snacking game is strong now that I know how to make my own tortillas on demand, and endless sourdough. However, it’s been a while since I had some of these little treats, and I am officially missing tater tots:

Maybe I’ll try to cook some up sometime. It seems pretty challenging though. Putting this on a list that also includes homemade lefse and ableskiver.

Do you _you_ like refrigerators?

I love the [Detroiters](http://www.cc.com/shows/detroiters)-level excellence of this ad. It’s utterly brilliant to just show the man I presume owns the shop slowly walking towards the camera. This is cinema.

If that wet your whistle, let’s dive in for a full link immersion.

## Links

- Have you seen the very good Middleditch & Schwartz special yet? If you need more of those two funny fellows, try this video of them playing a Jackbox game:

- Perhaps videos aren’t your thing, and you’re more of a reading fan. Reading is my favorite thing, and one of my only consistent hobbies, so it was awesome to find [this list](https://lithub.com/26-books-from-the-last-decade-that-if-you-havent-read-you-should/) via [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com) of excellent books you’ve likely not read, recommended by authors who are also rad.

- Have you still managed to avoid the siren song of Animal Crossing? I keep oversleeping/baking instead of buying turnips, so unlike some people I know, I’m not yet in a post-money economy. I’ve got bills to pay! Even still, I find this quarantine-time [live playing of the theme song](https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1261295269338992640?s=20) just delightful.

- I’m a big Formula 1 fan, which you might not know, but one of my least favoriting things about it is the lack of women driving in the sport. Luckily, there are efforts to sponsor and develop professional drivers, and I hope eventually Formula 1 teams and sponsors get over their misogyny and have [some of these awesome women](https://wseries.com) drive in the most prestigious series.

Meanwhile, deep into quarantine I’ve continued to bake up a storm, and I think this is my best boule so far!

I’ve got another one in the oven this morning, and I hope it turns out well. Also if you’re the sort of person who practices witchcraft, or otherwise wants to send some good vibes my way... Friday could be very interesting. Hopefully I can share more, and it’s good news. Short version is I’m trying to do something very neat at work.

I hope however you spend your next week, it’s a good one, and as always, I’ll see you next week, space cowgirls~
