Well, the long weekend and constant fireworks in Oakland threw me for a loop! I lost track of the days and thought it was Saturday, and I still had an entire evening to prepare this email for you. Alas! Here’s a rare evening edition my newsletter.

## Links

- This account is utterly bizarre and so are [these warnings](https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=6476370&id=5A1B20E2-AA1D-434F-A62E-44497ADF7F68). There’s a strangely surreal aspect to a lot of the governments social media, that I can’t tell whether I find charming or depressing.
- If you’re worried about radiation, you could get a dosimeter, but why not [breed cats to change colors instead](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/jan/08/colour-changing-cats-warn-radioactive-waste-nuclear-plants-distant-descendants)?
- if you need something great to read during the quarantine, why not dive into this short fiction from Murakami [about a monkey](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/confessions-of-a-shinagawa-monkey). 
- Building [customer service robots while the world burns?](https://thebaffler.com/latest/chatbots-at-the-end-of-the-world-connolly) That’s par for the course in Silicon Valley. That, and continuously attacking a journalist for reporting on the industry. It would be pretty amazing if folks decided to work on global warming or other pressing global crises, but until then, I guess returning my yoga pants will be better.  
- I finished watching Berlin Station this week, and also decided to read [the writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olen_Steinhauer) of the show’s book series about CIA Tourists.
- Does anyone know why it’s called “chankonabe/ちゃんこ鍋”？I can’t for the life of me find out the etymology of that dish. If you know, [hit me up](mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com).
- In honor of July 4th, do everyone a favor and read about the [racial wealth gap](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/). American capitalism is a pernicious force of white supremacy, and we’ve got to change things.

Thanks again for bearing with me this evening and being patient for these links. I hope your week is relaxing, and you are able to stay inside/social distance and avoid the spike of COVID that’s ravaging most of the states. Keep fighting, and see you next week, space cowgirls~
