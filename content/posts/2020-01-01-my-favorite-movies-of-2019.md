Out of [74 movies](https://letterboxd.com/brookshelley/films/), I wanted to pick a few that really stood out, and then talk briefly about a few that I really didn't enjoy. I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn't get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I've accrued over the years.

## The List

In no particular order, here are ten films that really stood out to me.

**‌Uncut Gems**

A real delight of failure and crushed dreams.

**Shoplifters**

A family of criminals gets to be perfectly human.

**Destroyer**

Nicole Kidman is a badass drunk detective.

**Us**

Under the boarrrrddddwalk. Boardwalk.

**Arctic**

Competence porn.

**Midsommar**

The best breakup film ever.

**The Farewell**

I cried quite a bit—major family feelings.

**First Reformed**

The world is getting hotter, and Ethan Hawke is too, inexplicably.

**Booksmart**

Cool buddy comedy with a talented younger cast.

**Parasite**

Eat the rich.

Honorable mention: Ford Vs. Ferrari.

## The Bad

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker**

Look, I don't want to spoil this for anyone who cares, but has somehow not seen the film yet. I was super disappointed in how the series ended, and what a raw deal Rose got. Did we need _yet another droid_? It's particularly sad that with the Mandolorian really succeeding as a tv show, this is the pap we get in theaters. [Demi is better at tearing this apart than I am](https://letterboxd.com/demiadejuyigbe/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/1/).

**Predator**

Wow. Even as a fan of crap action films, this was a letdown.

**Hobbes & Shaw**

Listen, I _love_ the Fast & Furious series like a warm blanket—it has cars, explosions, family, and little-to-no-complexity. Some of that was still present in this film, but they managed to hamstring the only female protagonist, and replace all the joy with ball jokes.

**Wandering Earth**

I don't know why I expected this to be great, but it was just hokey as hell.

**Avengers: Endgame**

I know, right? I hated the new Star Wars and the end of the Avenger's duology? I'm obviously a monster. Unfortunately, this movie was much like Rise of Skywalker in that it mistook random scenes of characters folks recognize for a plot or joy. It takes more than seeing Spider-Man appear on screen for me to be excited these days—just look at the incredible Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse for tips on how to do this well. I think some plot lines do better in multiple comics, and not on the silver screen. Smaller, more fun superhero films in 2020, please.

## 2019 streaming

Wow, 2019 was a great year for films! If you want to read longer reviews of the above films, visit my [movies page](https://www.brookshelley.com/movies). I didn't set out to watch more films this year, but with Amazon Prime, Criterion, Kanopy, iTunes, and Netflix, it was super easy to watch most of the stuff I wanted to see. I finally upgraded to a 4K TV and 4K Apple TV too, so I will likely watch even more things at my house without trekking to the land of empty cola machines and questionable curly fries.

## 2020

Looking towards next year, the films I'm currently most excited about are:

**A Promising Young Woman**

Revenge films? Yes please.

**New Mutants**

One of the coolest X-Men teams ever, in the theater.

**No Time to Die**

I honestly love James Bond films, and I can't pretend otherwise.

**Monster Hunter**

I don't know why I love Resident Evil movies so much, but the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson has moved to a new video game adaptation has me stoked.

**Dune**

The David Lynch version of Dune, in all of its weirdness, was one of the movies I watched on repeat as a child. I know, that explains a lot, right? I can't wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the subject matter. The spice must flow!
