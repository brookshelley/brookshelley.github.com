January is nearly over! I had a delicious meal last night of pork cartilage soup (豚軟骨汁) and dug into an [old classic sci-fi book](https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/deborah-christian/mainline.htm) on recommendation from Robin Sloan’s newsletter. It’s weird and fun so far. I also started back at the gym last week, which left me hobbling around as my body complains about all the rowing I did. At least it’s next to my office!

Enough about that, here’s more links:

- Throw on the [new Alice Boman](https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-knows/1479120003?i=1479120009) while you read, or even after, on a long walk.
- Anne Helen of burnout fame wrote elegantly this week about how we manage to [always be working, and never actually resting](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-wages-of-productivity).
- Feel inspired to waste some time? This week I learned you can subscribe to the [RSS feed of videos on YouTube](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/01/16/youtube-rss-feeds/) instead of bothering with YouTube’s terrible interface.
- Maybe we should start thinking [more about seasons and less about years](https://austinkleon.com/2020/01/06/circular-time-vs-linear-time/). I’m really enjoying this winter, partially because I’m trying to embrace the good things about it.
- Remember Yo? Perhaps there was [something good there](https://laughingkaiju.com/yo-really/) after all.
- A cool cartoon with a mean gauged-ear [queer-coded protagonist](https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/8/21057255/infinity-train-book-2-new-episodes-tulip-jesse-mt-mystery)? Sign me up!

Well, it’s time for me to head back into my 80s sci-fi world before going to watch [Weathering with You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering_with_You). Have a great week, and I hope you spend your MLK Jr. day thinking about ways to enact anti-racism in your daily life.

See you next week space cowgirls~
