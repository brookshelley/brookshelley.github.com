no cis men, says the sign on the door
and i read, prove yourself
are you woman enough to enter this building
not woman like dresses
but woman like a body you didn’t get for free
the feeling that these spaces want to spit us out
like we won’t be safe from the pain of judgement
because it follows us in
and comes out through their eyes

do you see me?
do you see what I am trying to do?
who i am, and what i am
am i more to you than a token
or just a tragic figure
am i someone you could fuck
someone you could fall in love with
can i come to your party and feel at home?

they check my id and find the F
the sign they look for to say “you’re good”
but i see the glint of doubt in your eyes
when i say thanks and my voice sounds
just a little too deep
the foot to head look they give
doesn’t read as checking me out
so much as vetting my existence
i feel a shiver of fear, and swallow it down

i dance and flirt as armor against the other
this belonging feels like a battle
and i am not one to give up easy
