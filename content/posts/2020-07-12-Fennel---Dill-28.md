Another week, and another Formula One race in Austria. For the first time in the over 70 year history of this race series two races occurred at the same track. The first race included loads of suspension and tire issues due to curbs, and this weekend included with a veritable lake on the track. If you’ve never watched car racing, I recommend Netflix’s excellent [behind-the-scenes series](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890?s=i&trkid=0). Outside of high speed racing, my week was a bit of a let-down, as I found out I didn’t get a position at work I’d interviewed for on Wednesday. Chin up though, I have to think, as there will be more opportunities to come. Hopefully your week had some nice news instead!

Here’s a raccoon chaser for that wild article:

- Did you see “the letter” this week? The sad, out of touch, last-gasp of milquetoast “intellectuals” who can’t be bothered to care about the hoi polloi? Regardless (or “irregardless”, lol, that’s another story from this summer), this [piece by Sarah Jeong](https://www.theverge.com/21320338/letter-harpers-writers-free-speech-canceled-social-media-illiberalism) is an excellent look at Harper’s garbage missive.
- I can’t believe I only *just this week* discovered David Rees’ [Going Deep](https://www.amazon.com/Going-Deep-David-Rees-Season/dp/B00M50KCGA) tv show and it’s excellent investigation of the [slow loris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_loris). If you want to see David talk about his career and the ups and downs of being a cartoonist and comedian, this [excellent talk from XOXO 2016](https://xoxofest.com/2016/videos/david-rees) will fill that desire.

Thanks again for reading, and spending your summer indoors virtually with my internet history and curiosity. August is fast approaching, but the weather outside is still gorgeous here. I hope you’re able to spend a few hours in the sun this weekend, quietly appreciating the distance from other people, and maybe reading a good book. As always, stay safe and keep fighting, space cowgirls~
