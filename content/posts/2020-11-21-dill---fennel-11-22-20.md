Ah the start of my birthday week. 

https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1329341287166734336?s=20

Birthdays aren't my favorite thing, but this year it's nice I get to celebrate living another year instead of the holiday wherein the US celebrates our subjugation and theft of land from thousands of nations of indigenous folks. 

Fuck Thanksgiving.

I wish we celebrated other fall holidays instead, like [solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice) or [추석](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuseok) or even [勤労感謝の日](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Thanksgiving_Day). Plus, Turkey is a low-tier bird. If you're going to eat a bird, [roast a duck](https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/09/the-food-lab-how-to-make-peking-duck-at-home.html).

Feel free to raise a glass to my birth if you'd like to—no sacrifices or animal products required.

Here’s a birthday soundtrack for you:

My plan is to drink a little wine or something outside with a friend, quietly. Alameda county just instituted a 10pm curfew, which I am not sure will be effective in curbing COVID cases. It seems like the [jerks who have indoor meals and gatherings](https://twitter.com/BillFOXLA/status/1328932610169561090?s=20) will continue to do so. I have a couple friends who are seeing their families during Thanksgiving, but they've been quarantining and will do so again afterwards. 

I hope this can get better sooner than later, tbh.

Hope you're staying safe!

Let's _link it up_. 

## Links

- Are your parents boomers? Have you wondered what the Internet might be like for them? [Wonder no more](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/internet-baby-boomers-misinformation-social-media_n_5f998039c5b6a4a2dc813d3d). The short version is they see a vastly different internet than most of us, with a strong and upsetting trend towards right-wing misinformation from all sorts of shitlords. Instead of keeping the previous generation from installing spyware and malware from email links, it is now a responsibility of their kids to keep them from fully joining the death cult.
- I got my new M1 Mac this week, and it's [so, so fast.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition) I wrote a bit about it on [my site](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/apple-season/), but the short version is it does everything my old computer does faster, and with a significantly lower power requirement. Because of the redesign of Rosetta to be a translation layer, things even run faster through it too. I get the sense there will be a few months between now and when all apps are updated for Apple Silicon, but something like 90% of what I use is already there.
- Do you feel a little lost in the surreality of the modern internet? [Here's a travel guide](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/). We've come a long way since BBS and alt.mac communities, and I'm curious to see if we move back into a world more focused on small private communities instead.
- Maybe we'll [print out](http://www.printgrowstrees.org/index.html) [zines](https://archive.qzap.org) again instead. Who doesn't wish there were more issues of [Mean Dyke](https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/528)? What about [Camp Trans](https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/563)? There's so [much more](https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/337) awesome stuff out there, and much like Geocities, I love seeing wild creations of folks not limited to 280 characters or being responded to by folks who don't bother to understand nuance.
- Pour one out for a [website that was too expensive](https://www.needsupply.com), but I still browsed through occasionally in fits of capitalist pique.
- We may not be able to travel right now, but we can go back in time a little and [view Tokyo through one man's camera](https://wimwendersstiftung.de/en/film/tokyo-ga-2/). It's fascinating to see how little parts of Japan have changed since the 80s.

## In Closing

Listen to some calm music:

Love yourself and your friends.

Get real, real cozy.

I’m talking wool and nog. Candles and cats. Fireplaces, trees, baking a pie. This is truly the best season or hunker down and stay safe. I want to see all of your shining faces next summer.

I spent a lot of Saturday talking with my friend Lena on a hike about getting older and learning to appreciate who we are at our core. Her friendship continues to be such a boon. I hope you have a close pal you can just be yourself with over the phone, on a walk, or even as a partner.

Make something this week that smells amazing, space cowgirls~
