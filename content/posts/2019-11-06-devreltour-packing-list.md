As usual, when I go on a DevRel tour, I like to write about what I've packed. This trip was a 3 week journey from Tokyo, through Kyoto, to Osaka, and back. As I write this, halfway through the trip, I feel very good about the amount of stuff I brought.

## Bags

- RYU Quick Pack 18L
- Topo Designs Trip Pack

Last time I went to Japan, I brought the DSPTCH Waist Bag as my day bag, and my shoulders immediately regretted it. I think my days or a one-shoulder bag with a computer are pretty much over. This time I returned to my tried and true setup. I’ve reviewed or written about both of these bags previously.

- Two Sea-to-summit dry bags

These are great for clothes and toiletries, and additionally ensure that even in a downpour I can keep a few things dry.

- One Topo Designs accessory bag

This time around, I loaded my toothbrush and some other non-leaky toiletries into this bag because I noticed the metal tip of my electric toothbrush kept *almost* poking through my dry bag.

## Clothes

### Jackets

- Mission Workshop Torre Windshell

My daily jacket. I’ve got two of these and they’re awesome. Not quite waterproof, but warm enough, and water-resistant enough for a drizzle and temperatures between 7-20C (mid-40s to mid-60s F).

- Arcteryx Cordetta

If it rains, I’m covered.

### Shirts

- Wool t-shirts from Ryu and Icebreaker

A great way to stay dry and warm or cool. These wash easily and are comfy for all-day-travel.

### Pants

- Two pairs of Outdoor Voices RecTrek pants

I wear these to work daily, and they’re pretty ideal. Comfy, flexible, and a bit water-resistant. The pockets are also *huge* which means my phone fits easily in a front pocket.

### Shoes and socks

- Blundstones
- Bombas no-show

These shoes go on and off pretty easily, and look nice enough for business meetings while still feeling good for longer walks. Half of this trip was a vacation, where I wandered around all day, including hiking. I almost went with my new KOIO shoes, but at the last minute, opted for slip-one with a *lot* of grip.

### Underwear

- Wool stuff from Icebreaker

Wool is the way to go. I’ve tried other solutions and they were nice enough, but ultimately, wool holds up the best and wicks super well.

## Tech gear

- Kindle Oasis
- Battery
- USB-C -> C, and Lightning: iPad and iPhone
- USB-A -> Watch
- USB-A -> Micro: Kindle
- iPad Pro 10.5 w/ Smart Keyboard

At some point, maybe I can travel with only USB-C cables, but that world doesn’t exist yet. Fortunately my external battery has a USB-C port and a USB-A port, so I use those two to charge my phone and watch at night. On the plane my USB-C to USB-C cable means I can top-up my iPad if I play too many games or get low mid-season of a tv show. It completely boggles the mind why the Kindle isn’t a USB-C device yet. Seriously. It’s 2019.

## Other stuff

![weeks](/photos/weeks2019.jpeg)

- Toiletries
- Hobonichi Weeks & Kaweco Al EF fountain pen
- お土産

The usual assortment of unguents, potions, and a toothbrush, along with my trusty new pen and notebook. I *love* this Kaweco pen, which is both completely blacked-out, and compact. I also brought some small gifts for 東京と大阪の同僚。
