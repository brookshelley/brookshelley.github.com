What a year! Remember in January, when we all had hopes and dreams? Every year I try to think back to the previous year and look ahead to the things I'm planning, and this year that feels a bit futile.

On the upside, I've gotten to know a few friends a whole lot better, and spent a ridiculous amount of quality time with my cat, Snorri. I also got to bike a bit, and learn how nice _nesting_ can be at home.

Here's to all the wine I drank, and all the vegan chicken nuggs and yuba I consumed. Three cheers to the many, many pounds of flour I alchemised into sourdough boules, and the inventor of the Hoffman method (thanks Ian), who finally gave me a recipe I could create consistently great bread from.

Shout out to _the cult_ and our various adventures on the fields of Verdansk, in the hills of Cache Creek, or surrounded by Redwoods. Love y'all!

I still wish I was able to see my friends around the globe, and I hope some day (2022?) I'll be able to travel again. From the writing retreat in Yoshino that was canceled, to hermit life I've led out of caution, this was a year of bummers, scares, and hoping my loved-ones would make it through.

## 2021

I don't know what I'll write about 2021 yet, other than a plan to love people more fiercely, and listen more carefully. 

Don't give up! Take care of each other, and thanks for reading~
