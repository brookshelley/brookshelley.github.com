We’re halfway through with the first month of 2020, and the sun has been out a lot this week in the bay. Luckily, I got some new sunglasses https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1215889336874332161?s=21, so I’m feeling great about the whole thing. 

Have you already mastered all of your New Year’s resolutions? Mine was the same as it is every year: “do more of what you love and less of what you hate”. So far, so good.

One of the things I love is writing, so I’ll keep on doing it. Another is the television program [Halt and Catch Fire](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-09-rewatching-halt-catch-fire/), which I wrote about so that I could combine pleasures. If only I’d managed to eat prosciutto while writing, I would’ve likely passed out from delight. 

Two new things I’m trying this year: going to the gym next to my office, and washing my face. I was a big powerlifter for over a year in Portland, but never found my rhythm here in the bay due to a weird commute. Fortunately, the gym next to my office seems great for lifting, and since it’s literally a few feet from the bus home, I think I’ll be able to use it at least a few times a week. Time will tell. As for washing my face? I’ve never really done it, so I’m not sure what I’ll get out of the whole endeavor, but I’m _aging_ so I figured no time like the present. 

Ok, sorry for the rambling, I know you’re here for... the links:

- It’s chilly out in the northern hemisphere, so perhaps you’d enjoy a sauna or hot tub dip. If you’re not quite sold on them yet, [Sadou](https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/05/16/sauna-enthusiasm-manga-sadou-steams-up-a-live-action-tv-drama), the delightful program about a sauna a lover is really delightful. I’m not sure if there are subtitles out there yet, but if you can speak Japanese, or just enjoy a show where you don’t know what’s being said, I highly recommend taking a look.
- While we’re on the topic of Japan, how about a man who bakes [sweet potatoes on the back of his custom Miata](https://theoutline.com/post/7571/meet-lord-rod-the-sweet-potato-king-of-yokohama-japan?zd=1&zi=uyn27jjq)? My friend Joe writes some truly engaging essays, and this one is especially fun.
- If you prefer animated shows, [this season of anime](https://www.animefeminist.com/winter-2020-premiere-reviews/) is promising, especially [Eizouken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Eizouken). There are some stinkers too, but hopefully you can avoid those.
- Currently I’m reading a few things, and you might like them. First, a [magazine about life](https://www.offscreenmag.com/) and often about turning things off and going out into the world. Next, a book that teaches you how to [get better at time and communication](https://jkglei.com/unsubscribe/). Finally, I am exploring the world of [assassins with Celaena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_of_Glass) and an assortment of dull men.

Hopefully these links keep you warm this week, and you’re able to find time for yourself and the things you love. Until next week!

See you space cowgirls~
