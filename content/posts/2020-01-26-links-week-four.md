## redesigns and long reads. 

I got to see William Gibson this week in the city, and listening to his southern drawl discuss the intricacies of stubs and alternate realities. Once I finish [Mainline](https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/deborah-christian/mainline.htm), I can’t wait to dive into [Agency](https://onezero.medium.com/william-gibson-takes-aim-at-the-silicon-valley-he-helped-create-in-an-exclusive-excerpt-of-agency-97c3604fbcde). Maybe every generation has a real feeling of living in the future, but between tech news and world news, things are a little too reminiscent of sad cyberpunk. This is why I read fiction—at least there we can have heroes.

And now, the links:

- No family? If you’re in Japan, you can [rent one](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry). I wonder if this would save me money on therapy, or leave me even more psychically confused?
- Two sites I read have recently gone through a redesign (much like mine), and it’s fun to see how they [thought about it](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/gardening-vs-architecture/). Even when the site update isn’t a bit overblown it can be [very interesting](https://www.animefeminist.com/the-great-anifem-makeover-is-here/).
- In addition to redesigning our personal websites (you started blogging, right? It’s good for you), perhaps we should find other ways to _[fix the web](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/opinion/world-wide-web.html)_.
- One friend who blogs blessed us this week with a survey of the [feral cats of their neighborhood](https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/579803.html). 
- Finally, here’s [a longer read about Instagram](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/essays/my-instagram/). More than a few friends consider Instagram to be their nice, chill place online—a place for soothing images and creativity. I wish it had stayed that way for me, but alas, between ads, and folks aiming to take the exact same photo or get _really stoked_ on exercise, I found it uncomfortable at best. For me, Slack is largely the place I see friend’s photos. I hope that at some point a non FB company will try to solve the friends + friends of friends photo sharing problem.

This year I decided to upgrade my coffee at home a bit more than before, and my latest acquisition is all about [drinking coffee by the window](https://www.hario.jp/seihin/productdetail.php?product=XGS-60TB) and reading books. Prior to this coffee server, I would drip directly into a Zojirushi vacuum thermos, but I prefer the look at ease of carrying that this brings. It’s never a bad idea to add a little class to one’s weekend, I think. On that note, I would encourage you to take a few deep breaths, and think about simple ways you can make your days off even more relaxing and delightful.

Enjoy your Sunday, and I’ll see you next week space cowgirls~
