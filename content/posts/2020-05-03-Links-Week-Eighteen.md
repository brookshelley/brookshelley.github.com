Happy May! We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you're well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer. 

I've been cleaning, rearranging, and making lots of bread—I think I've finally sorted out my Sourdough woes.

One thing I can recommend for anyone looking to clean up a little are *a bunch* of [little velcro strips](https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Reusable-Fastening-Organizing/dp/B001E1Y5O6) to manage those cables. These little fellows are super versatile, reusable, and the package will probably last the rest of your life. What value!

If you haven't installed a desk and a nice office chair yet, I can heartily recommend doing so. I was sitting at my dining room table until Friday, on a modern but unsupportive kitchen chair. Ow. Now I have a Herman Miller Sayl, and a cool little desk to keep my stuff away from the "food zone". 

As we go through this week, I hope you have as much energy as all these cool ladies:

Cool, right? Here's some links:

## Links

- Do you like memes? Do you like AI? [Boom](https://imgflip.com/ai-meme?fbclid=IwAR2Z87afCI_yG2HsTyRgoa1yp5MytCPW2OB-X_TkttmJegoHnYp9BGolTg0). Someone put these two forces together, and it's an eerie laugh riot. A coworker never really understands memes, so I can't wait to just start sending him these.
- Did you know Jia Tolentino is younger than me? I sure didn't! I haven't read Trick Mirror yet, but she's pretty damn cool, I think. [This interview](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jia-tolentino-interview-trick-mirror-962686/) gave me a lot of insight into her world, and more interest in picking it up.

The next few links are related to a mindset for quarantine and the pandemic. Don’t worry if you feel like skipping them. I found them supremely helpful, but your mileage may vary:

- First, it seems that [taking the long view](https://www.raptitude.com/2020/04/take-the-long-view/) on terrible events may help us put our own suffering and frustration in context. Terrible things have happened to so many of us, and more will happen in the future, but the span of time we’re alive is vast compared to these months of difficulty.
- As a life post-pandemic begins, we should “prioritise people and societies, ecologies and environments, ahead of profit and productivity.” It’s not only possible for us to use this global crisis as a catalyst, I believe it’s absolutely vital. There is no “normal” to return to, because “normal” was always fucking terrible for millions. Let’s build a world we will be proud to hand off to the future inhabitants of Earth.

Finally, I blogged about this before, but there’s a whole troupe of bloggers doing a regular column over at [Indoor Voices](https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/), but one of the coolest ones is Coffeecore:

Whether or not you like coffee, [this story](https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/2020/05/coffeecore-on-city.html) will get you out of the house and sipping iced lattes, cups of black drip, and other delights in your mind. 

## Comics

During this copious indoor time, I’ve enjoyed reading quite a few [books](https://www.brookshelley.com/books), and a bunch of graphic novels, manga, and comics. Unfortunately, Marvel and a few other publishers decided to pause a number of series like [Decorum](https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/decorum-1) and [Injection](https://bookshop.org/books/injection-volume-1/9781632154798).

If you need a few volumes to read during this pause, I recommend these three:

[Die](https://bookshop.org/books/die-volume-1-fantasy-heartbreaker/9781534312708)
[City](https://bookshop.org/books/city-1/9781945054785)
[Dorohedoro](https://bookshop.org/books?keywords=Dorohedoro)

Also, all the new X-Men Dawn of X/House of X stuff is great as well, but those series are stuck on issue 10 until Marvel sorts out their single distributor issue. 

Are you reading anything great? Any old favorite manga or graphic novels I should check out? [Let me know](mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com). I hope the coming week is full of small pleasures, and delights. See you next week, space cowgirls~
