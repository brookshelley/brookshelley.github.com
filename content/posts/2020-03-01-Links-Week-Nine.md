This weekend is a bit sad, as it would have marked my countdown to a two week vacation in Japan, but due to coronavirus I had to cancel the trip. Perhaps I’ll do something else, but right now I’m just worried for my friends and coworkers abroad and at home. Keep your hands washed, your spirits up, and your days full of love. 

I did plan a second trip this year in November for the amazing [Focus retreat put on by Craig Mod](https://studiodradiodurans.com/collections/retreats/products/focus-yoshino-retreat-2020-apply). If you’re reading this, you might enjoy it, so I recommend [applying](https://studiodradiodurans.com/collections/retreats/products/focus-yoshino-retreat-2020-apply).

Snorri is currently sitting on my shoulder, and I’m taking his plaintive cries as a, “get to the links!” so I will:

- [This is a wide-ranging newsletter installment](https://craigmod.com/roden/036/) from one of my favorite newsletter writers recently. I particularly enjoyed this quote about developing our ideas and giving them real space:

> If an idea is any good, chances are you shouldn’t just be tweeting it, but rather giving it a more solid, fleshed out form as a blog post or essay or zine or whatever. This is out of respect for the idea itself. What I find most dangerous about Twitter is that it can generate similar chemical feelings to having done “the work,” when in fact, you haven’t done the work. You’ve just micro-plastic’d idea potential.

- There are so many ways to delete your tweets. I like [Jumbo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jumbo-privacy-security/id1454039975), but perhaps you’re [into](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2/)  [scripts](https://gist.github.com/robinsloan/3688616) or just want to artisanally [prune](https://micahflee.com/2019/06/semiphemeral-automatically-delete-your-old-tweets-except-for-the-ones-you-want-to-keep/). Take this opportunity, if you want, to [unfollow people](https://tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me/) who no longer bring you joy. I’m still off of Twitter and I think it might just stick.
- If you’ve been on the internet your whole life, or even just a lot of the adult parts, you perhaps carry shame from something you did or said. [Emily Gould tackles hers from her time at Gawker](https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/emily-gould-gawker-shame.html).
- Chances are, you’ve worked in an open-plan office during your career. It _turns out_ these are just about the [worst idea since Six Sigma](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/its-official-open-plan-offices-are-now-dumbest-management-fad-of-all-time.html) or trust falls. I don’t think cubicles are the solution either, but what if at some point we could have offices again?
- Do you love cool women and skateboarding? Yea, me too! You might [dig this magazine](https://www.oh-so.co/shop) in that case. Personally, I’ve got a serious backlog of [Offscreen](https://www.offscreenmag.com) and [Monocle](https://monocle.com), so I can’t quite subscribe right now, but it looks dope.]
- I’m also reading [The Longing for Less](https://www.kylechayka.com/book/) this weekend, which I got to hear a discussion about between Robin Sloan and the author, Kyle Chayka this week at the cute [Opera Plaza Books Inc](https://www.booksinc.net/SFOpera). If you’ve been around minimalism at all, or are curious about it, it’s well worth a read. It’s a critical survey and personal journey through music, writing, architecture, and hellish instagram minimalism.
- Finally, I hope you get a chance to _[eat the ball](https://www.eattheball.com/)_. Eat. The. Ball.

Hopefully this deluge of links gives you something nice to read and explore as you take time for yourself this week. The times may be scary, but there are so many neat people and things around too, and I am personally trying to stay focused on that. See you next week, space cowgirls~
