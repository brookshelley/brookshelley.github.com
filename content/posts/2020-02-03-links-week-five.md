A fiscal happy new year to you! I still don't really understand how fiscal years work, but in addition to a lunar new year, Snorri and I celebrated the beginning of FY21, and the 6th anniversary of my employer this weekend. Thrills and chills. 

Doesn't it already feel like spring? Just a little bit? At least in the bay, the plant outside are flowering, and it's already a little warm-is. This is my second year of not really having a winter, and I find the whole thing deeply confusing. On the upside, I never needed to add anything beyond a [beanie](https://www.tannergoods.com/products/merino-watch-cap) and a [bathrobe](https://www.parachutehome.com/products/waffle-robe) to my wardrobe.

On to the links!

- The well-regarded Mac and iOS calendar app Fantastical released a somewhat [controversial new version](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/the-new-fantastical-review/) this week that adds a ton of great stuff, but also moves to a subscription. I think I'll pay for this, especially because it means I can now create Zoom video links without needing to use Chrome. I'd reverted to using the basic calendar app on all my devices until now, but Fantastical 3 adds just enough polish and feature magic to get my cash.
- Do you ever think about the future of the internet? [This article from the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/before-zuckerberg-gutenberg/603034/) takes lessons from the printing press to assert we're likely wrong. I still think in general there will be a mix of democratizing and open publishing and the horrible continuation of the advertising gristmill. 
- Frankly, if [sweaty robots](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113421/soft-robot-hands-sweat-overheating-research) are the future, count me out.
- Need a little pick-me-up? Perhaps you'd enjoy some [tiny spells](https://tinyspells.xyz).
- My friend Casey gave a seminar on writing recently, and luckily for us, she shared [her notes](https://caseyplett.wordpress.com/2020/01/31/notes-from-my-seminar-at-usask/). If you care at all about writing, it's worth a read.

As always, may your week be filled with the appropriate amount of hydration, rest, and merriment. See you next week, space cowgirls~
