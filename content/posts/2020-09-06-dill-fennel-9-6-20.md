Well, it’s hot again in the Bay Area, on top of this wild smoke we’ve got everywhere. I’m pretty tired of it, for one, especially since I mostly want to hike and ride my bike right now. I *did* manage to go outside a little today to repot a LOT of plants. More on that later, but here’s one pretty plant from my house to tide you over.

I hope you’re finding things to keep you occupied—there’s plenty of new stuff on the various streaming platforms, and I’ve personally enjoyed the new Wallander and Away.

## In closing

Well, it’s time for me to get back to reading Dune: Messiah, and watching Young Wallander while I try to stay cooled-off and out of the smoke. Happy Labor Day! Please check your voter registration, and make sure to vote for local progressive candidates in November (or whenever mail-in ballots show up). If you’re reading this, I miss you, and I hope we can get a beer sometime soon. [Reach out](mailto:newsletter@brookshelley.com) if you want to show off your indoor forest. Stay safe and keep fighting, space cowgirls~
