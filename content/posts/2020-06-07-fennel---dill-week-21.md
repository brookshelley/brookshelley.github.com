Welp, first sunburn of the quarantine for this gal. I spent the afternoon in a friend’s yard (hi André and Haley) and forgot my skin has been softened by indoor lighting for months. On the upside, it was gorgeous outside, and I’m glad I got to sit in the sun.

Since I’ll be indoors for a while healing-up, a lot of todays’s links are indoor kid interests. So if you’re like me, I think you’ll enjoy these:

## Links

- First, here’s a [gorgeous dance movie](https://www.girlwalkallday.com/chapters-page) that I’ve had on my to-watch list for a while. It’s surreal to watch right now, since it involves a lot of public contact and even a subway ride in NYC, but it’s a nice reminder of the fun times.
- Next, lets do a [deep-dive into the religions of Dune](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-guide-to-dune-s-strange-and-intense-religions-1843460283). I personally love the oddball Bene Gesserit, and one of my regrets of my previous startup selling to another company is our next code sprint title series could’ve been Dune names. Alas.
- If reading about Dune makes you want to ship some of the characters, make sure you don’t make them [awkwardly lupine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html). There’s a lawsuit brewing at the intersection of fan fiction and self-published ebooks that will help establish case law around shared universes. I get t feeling the Omegaverse (read the above to know more) will stay open to all.
- This next one is a twofer on grammar. Why do we [delete initial pronouns in English](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/all-your-questions-about-pronoun-deletion-and-the-inexorable-death-of-the-universe-answered.html) lately? And how does that same deletion [function in Japanese](https://nihongoperapera.com/dirty-japanese-guide-subjects-and-deletions.html)? I journal quite a bit and speak Japanese decently, so I’ve run into this concept of deletion and assumed context sentences often. I think it’s a pretty fascinating concept.
- Here’s something else to watch: [anime for folks who haven’t seen anime](https://kotaku.com/8-great-anime-series-for-people-who-don-t-like-anime-1843616852). I’ve seen quite a few if these and can vouch for them. 
- Finally, let’s talk “warshers” and “diddles” in the [most high-stake professional sport in America](http://www.washers.org/terms.html#diddle).

This image is care of Joe—thanks Joe! It’s an emoji keyboard from a [Reddit on strange peripherals](https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/gph0lk/alps_kanji_keyboard_exotic_peripherals_week/).

Well, that’s it for this week. I’ve spent a lot of this weekend already playing a silly war game with friends, and it’s highly likely I’ll keep that going. More bread making as well. I hope you have a chill short week, and don’t randomly set off fireworks like all my neighbors... yikes.\
See you next week, space cowgirls~
