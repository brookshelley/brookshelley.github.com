# D&F 12/7/20

Instead of writing this on Saturday, as I usually do, I drank a lot of nog + aquavit (nogavit) at a distance with my friend Lena, and then watched the show Big Mouth on Netflix.

At some point, I think I even slept a little before trying to get to bed before 2am so I could wake up for a mini-retreat for the Women's Foundation of Oregon. I am tired.

We're starting another 3 weeks of full-lockdown thankfully, as cases skyrocket, and I am incredibly thankful. If folks take this three week period seriously we can make a dent. Please stay home. There's so much good tv!!

I will keep these links going during lockdown, and maybe they'll even get weirder? Anyways for now here's another set:

## Links

- Since it wrapped-up last week with a wonderful episode about risotto, I can heartily recommend you watch all of ['How to with John Wilson'](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5bvxj/how-to-with-john-wilson-hbo-nathan-fielder-2020). This show is in the vein of a the excellent 'Going Deep with David Reese', but is also a strangely gonzo B-roll show. Every episode goes to places previously unimagined, and I've laughed-out-loud a bunch watching it.
- Speaking of weird, one of my all-time favorite authors is particularly strange and I think his brand of bizarre storytelling fits this time where little makes sense. Please [read Kōbō Abe](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/17/the-ruined-map-secret-rendezvous-and-the-box-man-by-kobo-abe-review).
- I'm fascinated by alternate modes of running software companies, so this [video app coop is pretty interesting](https://www.org.meet.coop). I doubt it will make serious headway against Zoom, but I do wish folks would seriously consider the implications of using a "free" tool to run their lives. Nothing is ever _really_ free except for super neck-beard-y GNU stuff.
- Let's have a song break!

- *Finally* [a font for chaotic evil designers](https://hellveticafont.com/)! I love everything about this. It feels like something [my northern friend Haley](https://www.haleyfiege.fun/fonts) would do.
- Join me... in [experiencing mys](http://hollypocketloves.com/2019/10/07/how-to-create-mys-the-swedish-version-of-hygge/)! You, the one who is cozy now, experience mys! You the one who lit a candle, experience mys!
- I love a minimoon.

- I fell down a rabbit hole this week that led me to watching [this guy](https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/ross-edgley-great-british-swim) doing a Navy Seals assessment with Eddie Hall. I'm not sure what makes a person want to push themselves to the level of swimming fully around the UK, but hey, it makes an interesting story. I don't like the ocean much though. Spooky!

- Finally, here are some delightful quilts from some amazing [Black Texan quiltmakers](https://www.texasobserver.org/laverne-brackens-east-texas-quiltmakers/). I love learning about the history here, and that my home state has such amazing women in it.

## Closing

Sorry this is a little late, but thanks for reading. Have a chill Sunday, and think about the ways you can enjoy new New Years traditions that keep your mouth and air away from other humans. The story of christmas is a weird and likely mythic one, but if you do want to get a weird nativity, here's another one:

I'm here with you, from my strange bubble to yours, for the rest of the year. Let's make the most of it. Keep fighting and stay safe, space cowgirls~
