This email comes to you from a rainy port city, where I am spending time on strategy and vision for the Women’s Foundation of Oregon. Spending the weekend with a room full of amazing women from all over the state comprising our board was incredible. My heart is full, and I’m hopeful for the work we can accomplish in the coming years.

Next week I’ll be in yet another city on the other side of the globe, and despite the prevalent fear of disease right now, I’m excited to be on the road again, testing my travel packing and gear.

Whether you’re also traveling, or spending some time working from home this week, here are some links to keep you curious:

- On the topic of travel, did you know that scientists can’t agree on [how planes stay in the air](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/)? There are theories that mostly work, but all of them are missing some part. Honestly, it’s probably just an aeromancer on each plane.
- Remember Fraidycat from last week? Robin wrote a bit more about how [he’s enjoying it](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/master-tapes/), and how the creator of the site just wants to be left alone.
- Here’s a heartening tale of a company that raised their [minimum wage to 70k a year](https://kottke.org/20/02/what-happened-to-the-company-that-raised-minimum-wage-to-70kyr). A lot of folks wanted them to fail, and thereby prove that the system works better when some people live in poverty, but it turned out folks do better work when they’re less stressed about money. I mean, c’mon.
- Do you like books? Do you like arbitrary tournaments? Boom, here’s [both at once](https://themorningnews.org/tob/2020/golden-state-v-oval-v-we-cast-a-shadow.php). I love these silly march-madness-esque book-offs. I’ve only read a few books on this list, so I can’t wait to read more. Hopefully this tournament adds a few items to your to-read list too.
- Speaking of good books, I’m loving [Lurking](https://theoutline.com/post/8756/q-and-a-joanne-mcneil-lurking-book-how-person-became-user), which outlines the growth of the social web, and how people became _users_. I remember many of the events in this book very well, and Joanne interviewed folks that I know to write it, so it hit me at home. I usually don’t like non-fiction, Lurking moves through ideas in such an entertaining fashion that I forgot my preference.

Today I saw cherry blossoms all over the city, and it got me excited for the new season! Japan traditionally has 24 seasons, and we just entered 啓蟄 which is when all the little critters crawl out to celebrate and move about. Personally, I’m very excited to be one of the animals exploring the world during this season, dutifully avoiding crowds. As I saw someone say online last week: “Avoiding crowds? I’ve been preparing for this my entire life.” Jokes aside, I hope you and yours stay safe and happy during what is a scary time. And as always, see you next week, space cowgirls~
