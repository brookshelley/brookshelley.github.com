Ah, tis the week of `penis2`

{{<tweet 1334561466175787008 >}}

*If you don't care about Cyberpunk 2077, skip to the links*

After months of delay, and potentially transmisogynistic advertising, the _cyber witcher_ is alive. I'm playing Cyberpunk 2077, and so far, it's kinda fun. 

I've spent years wishing there was a great [Shadowrun game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_Returns) that was an FPS, I think I finally have something essentially the same. I'm hoping it's a bit more open-world than it currently is as I write this. I'll report back.

The year is _almost over_ and that is a delight to me. I'm taking the entire week of the 21st off from work, and that means I have a solid vacation from the 18th until the 3rd. Hurrah!

I hope you get a nice solitary break too, and lots of _eggs_ if you're not vegan:

Let's fill your head with links to pass that time~

## Links

First, let's set the mood with some music:

{{< youtube ZmSORFI2XzU >}}

- My friend Lena [sent this to me](https://www.tenpercent.com/meditationweeklyblog/good-snowflakes), and it really helps with my mindset as we enter the 10th month of quarantining. If you've never tried meditating, today is a good day to start. After all, you're probably reading this at home, and hopefully it's a bit quiet.
- As an avowed fan of Russian literature, I deeply enjoyed this essay [on Nabokov from Patricia Lockwood](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n21/patricia-lockwood/eat-butterflies-with-me). Firstly, pre-order [her novel](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/634158/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood/). Secondly, Nabokov was very, very weird, but a great read. If you've avoided him because of _Lolita_ try Pnin or Pale Fire.
- Spare 17 minutes to [listen to Yanis Varoufakis on how the current global economy seems hellbent on making billionaires richer to our detriment](https://7ampodcast.com.au/episodes/yanis-varoufakis-on-making-billionaires-richer). It's an appalling state of affairs, at least in this newsletter's opinion. One of the more frustrating aspects of this obvious pillaging of our planet is the rich' ability to convince everyone else that it's for their own good.
- Do you miss _Flash_? I didn't much until I took a look at Archive.org's [flash archive project](http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/). My old webcomic was completely created in Flash, so I've considered trying to use this to bring it back. 
- **Newsletter recommendation**! This one tackles some interesting topics, but I especially enjoyed this edition on [the college scam](https://genyeet.substack.com/p/america-pretends-it-does-not-see).
- Need something to read over the holidays? Look no further than this [comprehensive list of book of the year lists](https://kottke.org/20/12/the-best-books-of-2020)! My next few books are _all lined-up_ with _Hammered_ by Elizabeth Bear, and a re-read of _Infinite Jest_ by David Foster Wallace currently on my nightstand. Even if you're not much of a reader, I highly recommend cracking something silly and fun open and _logging off_ for a while. You might even enjoy it.

## Closing

2020 was a lot, but with only a few more weeks until 2021 in the US we're getting our first doses of a vaccine. From what I gather, it'll be months (likely until next fall), until we're in a state to get back to pre-pandemic habits, but it's nice to know we're at least moving in a direction. As I write this, the US is still grateful that the Supreme Court rejected a seditious case from the Texas AG to seize power for their awful figurehead, and I also hope we get to move past this as well.

My plan for 2021 is to keep this newsletter going for another year, and perhaps experiment a little with format. Thanks for reading so far through these 54+ editions, or however many you've come along for. I've loved writing these little linky missives to you each week, and it's made me feel a lot less alone knowing that somewhere out there a few of you are enjoying some weird shit I sent you.

Thanks for reading, and all your emails back! Stay safe, and keep loving each other, space cowgirls~
