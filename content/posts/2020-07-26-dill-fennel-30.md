# Dill & Fennel 30

This weekend was pretty nice in the Shelley house—we started early by taking Friday off to volunteer for the Women’s Foundation (Snorri mostly yelled), and spent the rest of our time laying around (Snorri), and playing [Good Sudoku](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/good-sudoku-by-zach-gage/id1489118195). I’ve also thought about getting back into shooting photos and biking around, which could be a fun adventure. In preparation, I even picked-up a [new camera](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iii), so expect better pictures of my cat and neighborhood soon. Can you believe there’s only one more week in July? I wish I could go swimming somewhere, but I don’t think it’s in the cards.

* Enter the world of [clandestine shipping](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-inside-the-high-stakes-world-of-clandestine-crude-shipping). I’m fascinated by what feels like *real spy shit* but is a lot of staring at satellite imagery all day. Maybe spy shit is boring most of the time?
* Fuck the Kochs and their [war against our country](https://www.inthepublicinterest.org/wp-content/uploads/ITPI_USPSPrivatization_July2020.pdf). Personally, I depend on the USPS for so much stuff, and I believe having a national mail service is vital to any thriving nation. Perhaps we should instead not require the post office to turn a profit? Thank your postal worker in the meantime, because they’re literally risking their lives to serve us.
* For a long time we’ve know that tipping is a bad deal for everyone, but did you also know it has [origins in white supremacy](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/17/william-barber-tipping-racist-past-227361)? Turns out. I wish we had zero sales tax (it’s regressive), and a high living wage for all workers that didn’t need to go to healthcare. I’m trying to think a little bit about a positive future in the ruins of pre-covid world, especially after reading [50 folks in Monocle thinking big](https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/134/).
* Finding yourself with free time, and thinking about doing your own thing? Top tip: [find a small niche](https://jmduke.com/2020/06/26/atypical-success). I love and use a few products made by very small teams, and find the prospect of making a chill “lifestyle” company pretty interesting. Perhaps one day when I’m interested in trying something new, I’ll try my hand at atypical success.

## In closing

Think about the apps and services you depend on, and the ones you truly love. Who’re the made by? [My writing tool](https://ia.net/writer), which I dearly love, is made in Tokyo and Switzerland, for instance. Also, have you seen anything amazing lately? Movie, tv, or in life? I’d love to [hear about it](mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com). As always, stay safe, and keep fighting! I’ll see you next week space cowgirls~
