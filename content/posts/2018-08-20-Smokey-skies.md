Due to a series of forest fires, Portland has looked like an alien planet for the past few weeks.

Every day I wake up and google "air quality" to see just how much I need to stay indoors, next to my air filter. My gym has closed for a few days for two weeks, and walking outside just plain sucks.

The only cool part is the sunsets are ridiculous, and the moon is red at night.

I really hope these fires aren’t an every year occurrence, but I’m not that hopeful, since global warming continues apace. Guess I’ll buy more indoor air filters and a Bane mask.
