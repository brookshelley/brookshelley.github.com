This was the week I left Twitter for a while. Honestly it wasn’t so bad, once I got over the twitchy “gotta open Twitter” feeling. I’ll write more about that experience soon, with some light suggested reading and a few tips. My main takeaway so far is that I spent a lot of time opening and closing and reopening Twitter for the last 10 years.

Here are a few things I would’ve sent:

You’re probably here for the links though, aren’t you?

## Links

- [This is what happens](https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/alexis-pereira-viral-essay-twitter-joke-diary.html) when you succeed at tweeting something funny.
- Last month I joined quite a lot of folks in the Bay Area in [reading Anna Weiner’s Uncanny Valley](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/culture-anna-wiener-uncanny-valley-review/). I don’t think it’s an incredible tell-all, but it was certainly entertaining.
- What is porn like for folks who can’t see? [This interview](https://slate.com/culture/2020/02/pornhub-audio-description-interview-accessibility.html) is fairly revealing.
- Were you ever broke? How about poor? There’s a pretty big difference, and [this comic](https://longreads.com/2018/06/12/the-difference-between-being-broke-and-being-poor/) helps illustrate what it looks like at the grocery store.
- Finally, if you’ve ever had the delight of shopping at Berkeley Bowl, you owe Glenn Yasuda thanks. [Let’s remember him.](https://sf.eater.com/2020/2/20/21145724/glenn-yasuda-berkeley-bowl-obituary)

I’m all out of links, and off to get my first haircut in the new year. Enjoy your week, and I’ll see you next weekend, space cowgirls~
