# Dill & Fennel 10/11/20

Let’s get SPOOKY!

{{< tweet 1314019257500479488 >}}

We’re only a few days away from what could be a pretty exciting Apple event! If you’ve waited for a while to get a new phone, or really want something smaller, [you might just be in luck](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-12-top-features/). Whether the rumors amount to anything, Apple is definitely launching something on Tuesday. I’ll be tuning in.

More than the phone even, I’m excited to see if they actually ship a computer with their own silicon. It seems like the main feature will be performance, with a side of excellent battery life. I can’t wait.

Other than tech shit, this week was nice and chill. The smoke outside continues to plague my bike rides, and the plague is a constant worry, but those are almost background pain at this point.

I hope you’re taking it easy as well, and that you have a neighbor who gives you bonus fruits from their trees! Thanks Haley for the amazing passion fruit!

This week should be good, so let’s get to it:

- It’s always good to start off your Sunday with a little bit of dancing:

- But remember, while you dance (outside) be sure to wear a [good mask](http://toolsandtoys.net/tom-bihn-v3-three-layer-cloth-face-mask/) and stay well-away from your fellow Ewoks.
- I just learned that my way too brilliant coworker Bert [made a finger to tap his Yubikey](https://bert.org/2020/10/01/pressing-yubikeys/). This is just the kind of disturbingly smart shit I love. I’m reminded of my friend Mark’s somewhat abandoned project to make a “cloud finger” that would open the garage door to our office a few years ago. Why touch things with your meat fingers, when you can make a single-use robot?
- [This](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/qiui-smart-chastity-sex-toy-security-flaw/) gives platform lock-in a whole new meaning. The real dominatrix was insecure APIs the whole time. 
- It’s pretty frustrating that anti-privacy advocates in Europe are using the specter of child predation to try to [destroy end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption). Instead of cursing us with no way to securely communicate, what if those legislators worked on houselessness and ending the wars they started in the global south?
- Sorry, that last one was heavy, so maybe we should play a _folk_ game:

- I’ll leave you with one of [my favorite albums this year](https://hailaker.bandcamp.com/album/holding).

## Closing

In preparation for [sliding candy down chutes](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/04/920038799/candy-chutes-could-save-halloween-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic) into the waiting baskets of masked trick-or-treaters, have you chosen a costume? I get this sense [this one](https://www.halloweencostumes.com/mens-tiger-king-trainer-costume.html) will be popular, even though Tiger King feels like it came out two-thousand years ago.

My friend Laura has a [way spookier newslettter](https://tinyletter.com/31daysofhalloween) that she only runs during October but is a daily treat this month. I hope you read it too.

So far _deathwatch_ 2020 hasn’t offered anybody any big winnings, but I know many stay hopeful. The fly this week reminded us that these men are actual pieces of shit.

If you feel up for getting involved a bit and supporting trans rights, [this event](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/events/spark-sponsors) next week should be good. My friend Haley took me to it last year and I had a great time. [Let me know](mailto:hello@brookshelley.com) if you want to join!

It’s a few weeks until the election, and I just voted. I hope you do too ([this guide was helpful](https://progressivevotersguide.com)). Keep fighting, keep loving, and I’ll see you next week, space cowgirls~
