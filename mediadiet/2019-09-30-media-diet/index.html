Queer space necromancers! OMG. This book was utterly bizarre, and a hell of a lot of fun. I’m a fan of low-tech future space stories, where for the most part the book seems more like fantasy than sci-fi, so this book was a joy. Plus there was necromancy! Apparently there are going to be two more books in this series, which is a delightful thing to learn, because I want to stretch out and learn more about this strange universe.</p><p><strong>Raven Strategem</strong> — Yoon Ha Lee</p><p>All the world building and deciphering of the strange calendrical system paid off in full in this book. Getting a hint of what Jedao/Cheris might want at the end of Ninefox, this book deals with the aftermath of a dangerously peerless tactician let loose in the galaxy. I enjoyed all the strange details of the hexarchs, and imagining what each moth looked like. It’s been a minute since a sci-fi book got me so excited. This series can feel like a slog at first, but I think it’s worth it.</p><p><strong>Ninefox Gambit</strong> — Yoon Ha Lee</p><p>This was one of the more challenging sci-fi books I&rsquo;ve read in a while. Ultimately, figuring out what the hell was going on was well worth-it, but the first half or so was a frantic dog paddle to stay afloat. The world of NineFox Gambit is deeply strange, with technology that borders on magic that requires an empire to hold to a strict calendar for it to function. We follow a rad lady, with a homicidal general trapped in her head as she runs what seems like a suicide mission. I&rsquo;m excited to read the rest of this series.</p><p><strong>Masterworks</strong> — Simon Jacobs</p><p><a href=https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/09/03/Masterworks-Review.html>Long form review</a></p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></p><p>The idea of this movie made me <em>very</em> anxious. Middle school is rough, and I was on edge for most of the film wondering if something very bad would happen, or if Checkov&rsquo;s AR-15 would reappear. <strong>Spoiler Alert</strong> No. There&rsquo;re definitely some sad moments, and some very tender and sweet ones, but no one big terrible event occurs. This isn&rsquo;t that kind of movie. Instead, Eighth Grade perfectly encapsulates how nervous and awkward we felt in our youth, and just how embarassed we were by our parents. I loved it.</p><p><strong>Between Two Ferns</strong></p><p>I love the parallel world of these bizarre and failed actors. I haven’t seen very many episodes of the web show, but this was pretty fun.</p><p><strong>Aniara</strong></p><p>TL;DR: Low-budget sci-fi cruise ship. This movie reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode, at least in its premise. I really enjoy movies where something goes horribly awry, and &ldquo;what if we&rsquo;re stuck in space forever&rdquo; definitely meets that criteria, but unlike the Twilight Zone, there&rsquo;s no big twist, just a slow sadness. There&rsquo;s a certain charm to the fact that it&rsquo;s Swedish as well. Plus, there’s space lesbians. We’re everywhere.</p><p><strong>Mega Time Squad</strong></p><p>Completely silly and fun. Low-budget time travel movies are often awesome (think Primer), but what if it was also a very low-brow comedy? Sweet as.</p><p><strong>Booksmart</strong></p><p>Wow, I really should&rsquo;ve watched this in the theater. This movie ruled. Outstanding cast, hilarious from start to finish. I want so many more amazing comedies that center rad women. More. Lesbian. Characters. In. Everything.</p><p><strong>Steven Universe: The Movie</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m not super fond of musicals, and this was most certainly a musical. Generally, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed Steven Universe, but more so when it&rsquo;s weird, and not saccharine. This movie leaned more towards the latter, so it was cute, but not really my bag. If singing and supportive friendships are your favorite part of the show, you&rsquo;ll love the movie. TL;DR your ex&rsquo;s polycule adopts you.</p><p><strong>Godzilla: King of Monsters</strong></p><p>Ridiculous, but exactly what I expected. A bit of Godzilla, a bit of the Core. I&rsquo;m fascinated by the idea that &ldquo;eco-terrorists&rdquo; have wide-reaching military power, lol. Shin Godzilla is still the best movie in the series, hands down, but this was a silly action romp.</p><p><strong>MI-5</strong></p><p>I fondly remember the British show <em>Spooks</em>, which ended in 2011. This movie was a nice reminder of the great things about that silly spy show.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/mediadiet>mediadiet</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><nav class="nav social"><ul class=flat><a href=/index.xml title=RSS><i data-feather=rss></i></a><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=Github><i data-feather=github></i></a><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><i data-feather=mail></i></a></ul><ul class=flat><li><a href=/about>about</a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
