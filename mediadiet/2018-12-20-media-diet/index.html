I got very confused for a while about who was who, but eventually I sorted it out.</p><p><strong>The Dark Archive</strong> — Victoria Schwab <a href=#ghost>**</a></p><p>A fun, strange YA book about what happens after death, and the teens who defend the afterlife. There were some cool twists, and story details throughout, but the world building could have been better. Honestly every time I read one of these, I think, &ldquo;wouldn’t this be better if it were gay?&rdquo;, and reader, yes, yes it would. These sorts of books must really speak to teens though, because they portray adults as largely ineffectual idiots, who occasionally get in the way.</p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>The Equalizer: 2</strong></p><p>This is apparent the first sequel Denzel has ever made. I’ve loved the genre of Denzel as an ultraviolent avenging angel ever since I saw Man on Fire. Some folks may prefer John Wick, and granted, those movies have a great style, but damn, the Equalizer is a series I hope to see more of in the future.</p><p><strong>Death of Stalin</strong> (rewatch)</p><p>It’s the season for rewatching films.</p><p><strong>Slice</strong></p><p>Super goofy horror film with lots of great folks. I think B movies can only rarely be made great from the start, and this one could’ve used a little less effort.</p><p><strong>The Fast &amp; the Furious</strong> (rewatch)</p><p>A few friends hadn’t watched this before, so we drank a bit, and had a rip-roaring good time seeing this again. Everyone is decked-out in the most late 90s gear, the camera work is bonkers, and the cars are cool, but painted like awful hot wheels. I <em>love</em> this series.h</p><p><strong>Hereditary</strong></p><p>Granted, the central twist was spoiled for me, but so much of this movie felt joyless. Theoretically this movie should’ve been right up my alley, but honestly I would’ve rather rewatched the VVitch for the umpteenth time.</p><p><strong>Widows</strong></p><p>This was one of my favorite movies of the year. Wow. A all badass lady heist movie with actual stakes! Everyone delivers in this film, and it was a hoot. A+</p><p><strong>Crazy Rich Asians</strong></p><p>This was a schlocky romcom about a very rarefied set of Chinese Singaporeans. It was fun enough, and now both of the people I saw it with want to flood the aisle of a building during their wedding. Moms are a lot.</p><p><strong>Girl with a Dragon Tattoo</strong> (rewatch)</p><p>My partner hasn’t seen these, and I would watch them again basically whenever, so here we are.</p><p><strong>Ant Man and the Wasp</strong> (rewatch)</p><p>Just as delightful the second go-round. More fun superhero movies please.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/mediadiet>mediadiet</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><ul class=flat><li><a href=/about>about</a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
