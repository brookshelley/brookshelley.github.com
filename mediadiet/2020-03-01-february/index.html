A really informative and fun book.</p><p><strong>しろくまカフェ　1</strong></p><p>私のこれが最初日本語の漫画を読んだ。面白かったよ。次に谷崎の文学を読むww。</p><p><strong>Outline</strong> — Rachel Cusk</p><p>This was recommended to me, but I can’t say I loved it. The story here read more as a series of strange anecdotes, without a lot of core thread to grasp. There are two more books in this series, but I think I may pass on them.</p><p><strong>Agency</strong> — William Gibson</p><p>A nearly present-day story of AI, art, and San Francisco. I really enjoyed this Peripheral sequel, though I think on the whole the fashion and strange web world of the previous trilogy was more my speed. I hope we get one more book with Netherton, Ash and company.</p><h2 id=movies>Movies</h2><p><strong>Jojo Rabbit</strong></p><p>A deeply strange film about learning how to be a person and unlearn fanaticism. There were some pretty excellent cameos in this, and a very dark comedic beat.</p><p><strong>Phantom Thread</strong></p><p>Wow, this movie was hilarious from top to bottom. A friend (hi Drew) invited me to see it for the first time in 70mm, and all I want to do is channel Woodcock every day. &ldquo;What am I supposed to do with that?&rdquo;. What a joy. I can&rsquo;t wait to watch this again.</p><p><strong>First Love</strong></p><p>A strange mistaken gangster film. This was much more straightforward than many Takeshi Miike films, but still managed to add in some really bizarre bits, and even some surprises.</p><p><strong>Elle</strong></p><p>Yow. That was&hellip; a lot of movie. Isabelle Huppert was fantastic, but I don&rsquo;t know if I could recommend it. Definitely one of the stranger Verhoeven movies I&rsquo;ve seen.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong></p><p>Another lady assassin movie. It was a helluva ride and I enjoyed it. I don’t think it added anything huge to the genre, but I’m just glad to have more cool movies about tough women. That said, I wish Anna had been able to just be with her girlfriend instead of randomly fucking spymasters.</p><p><strong>Gennocidal Organ</strong></p><p>I read the book this movie is based on last year, and it’s a truly brutal story of linguistics and massive unrest. This movie is grim in a way that feels a little too prescient. Definitely one of the better anime thrillers I’ve seen in a while though.</p><p><strong>Psycho Pass Movie Trilogy</strong></p><p>After season 3, Psycho Pass had a trilogy of films in Japan. They’re fun continuations of the characters from all three seasons, and a bit of a sequel to the first movie. The future this film presents is pretty grim, but the animation is fantastic.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/media-diet>Media diet</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><ul class=flat><li><a href=/about>about</a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
