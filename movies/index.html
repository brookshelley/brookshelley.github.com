I only knew a little about the U2 bomber and our history of capturing spies until I watched this film and dove into Wikipedia. This movie made me miss Berlin, which I’ve only visited once for a few weeks, but was delightful. If you enjoy the work of Tom Hanks, he does his thing well in this movie.</p><p><strong>Gemini Man</strong></p><p>I can only imagine a certain “religion” has also cloned Will Smith at some point. This was way more fun than it had a right to be, and weirdly enough the young Will CGI was pretty solid. How long until we see movies with young Cruise, or Washington? Have a bottle of wine and turn your brain off for 2 hours.</p><p><strong>‌式日</strong></p><p>This was a lot of movie. When I was younger I think I had more patience for particularly slow films, but I ended-up being a little distracted during 式日. I’m glad I finally got to watch it though, as it was pretty interesting seeing Iwai on the other side of the camera. Also I really miss being in Japan now.</p><p><strong>Waiting for Guffman</strong></p><p>Ah, a classic. It’s wild seeing Fred Willard in this looking so young comparatively. I watched this obsessively in high school and it really, really holds up.</p><p><strong>Nightmare on Elm Street</strong></p><p>Did you know Depp was in this? I certainly didn’t! This is the second movie I’ve watched because of the podcast <strong>The Scaredy Cats</strong> wherein one host of Reply All tries to help the other host inure himself to horror films. With all of the cultural cachet this movie had, it was interesting to see how quickly they showed Freddy himself. Freddy also seemed shorter than I imagined. I also always find it funny when all the “high school” actors are in their twenties. Why not just set it in college?</p><p><strong>Upgrade</strong></p><p>An interesting take on the post-human world. It’s a schlocky, funny, gory AF film, and not very into its own violence. Also it was rad to see Betty Gabriel from Get Out again.</p><p><strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong></p><p>Weird how much more low-key enjoyable this was than the last movie I watched. From the delightfully bad puns, to Jim Carrey having way too much fun, to Ben Schwartz just being himself, this was a nice Saturday afternoon romp. I went in expecting basically nothing, and was pleasantly surprised.</p><p><strong>The Dead Don’t Die</strong></p><p>This movie so badly wanted to be clever, it is the film equivalent to wearing a “funny shirt” from Hot Topic and explaining the joke to everyone before they can even laugh.</p><p><strong>The Lodge</strong></p><p>One of the better horror films I’ve seen in a while, with a very scary house, and an excellent secluded location.</p><p><strong>Saturday Night</strong></p><p>A fun documentary with rather overwrought camera-work that shows what preparing for and shooting SNL is like. It’s kinda wild to see the sheer number of writers and staff that make it come alive.</p><p><strong>The Exorcist</strong></p><p>Pretty creepy, with great special effects considering the time. I always root for the demons in any one of these, and definitely wondered while watching this how many more kids priests hurt than these imagined evil spirits. The devil, it turns out, was the church all along.</p><p><strong>Vivarium</strong></p><p>Started creepy, got way creepier. I appreciate the unwillingness to tell the viewer what the fuck is happening. This plays out like a great Ursula K Le Guin novel.</p><p><strong>After the Storm</strong></p><p>Koreeda is one of the best directors when it comes to presenting the sadly funny banality of life. I can’t fathom someone else who could present a deadbeat dad and dysfunctional family with such pathos. This isn’t quite as heartrending as Shoplifters, but it comes close.</p><p><strong>Game Night</strong></p><p>Just a good time. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and it hopped along at a good clip while keeping me laughing.</p><p><strong>Hustlers</strong></p><p>I love a good grift. I’m still low-key mad this wasn’t about a lesbian romance between J Lo and Constance Wu though.
<strong>The Commuter</strong></p><p>A perfectly serviceable train thriller. Pretty fun.</p><p><strong>Jumanji: Next Level</strong></p><p>Have you ever wanted to see the Rock play Dan Devito? What about Jack Black playing a younger black guy? This movie was more bizarre than the last but hey, it was also fun.</p><p><strong>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</strong></p><p>The extras’ costuming in this film is deeply strange, with a mix of “Indiana Jones pan-middle-east” and “Mad Max”. This whole film was a glorious mess, and I loved it.</p><p><strong>The Guest</strong></p><p>This was surprisingly funny and very bizarre. I really enjoy Dan Stevens, ever since his turn as Xavier’s son Legion.</p><p><strong>Prisoners</strong></p><p>In preparation for the eventual release of the new Dune film I wanted to familiarize myself with Villneuve’s ourve. This is a very good mystery film with a grittier Gyllenhal than his turn at Zodiac.</p><p><strong>Rythym Section</strong></p><p>A training montage revenge flick that slowly transforms into a pretty thrilling action movie.</p><p><strong>Bloodshot</strong></p><p>“I don’t mind the scars, I just don’t like the stories they tell.” With a time-to-tanktop of just under 5 minutes, you know from the jump this will be a new Diesel vehicle. This movie had it all: underwater tai-chi, weightlifting, Guy Pierce, and a drinking competition to hone in on Vin’s favorite shot. Of course, as a Chinese-financed movie, there’s no blood or sex or skeletons. Also why didn’t they put that one guy’s eyes in his head instead of on his chest?!</p><p><strong>Radius</strong></p><p>Interesting conceptually, but it didn’t really go anywhere besides the concept. It would’ve been better as an anime, lol.</p><p><strong>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</strong></p><p>Well, fuck. That was gorgeous and sad. This movie built until my heart ached, and wove a story of falling in love.</p><p><strong>Crawl</strong></p><p>It’s no Underwater, but I guess if you want to see a great reason not to visit Florida, this is a perfect anti-ad.</p><p><strong>Underwater</strong></p><p>This turned out was cooler that i was expecting. Can’t say much more without spoiling anything.</p><p><strong>General Magic</strong></p><p>After seeing the fictionalized versions of many of these folks in Steve Jobs, and hearing so many stories about others—some of whom I’ve met—this was a really interesting look at a company that catalyzed much of what we use every day to live online.</p><p><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p><p>Oh, hey, it’s Shiv! It’s kind of fascinating that the entire story is told through the lead-up to the presentations that implanted Steve Jobs in so many of our brains. I really enjoyed seeing this, and also think it’s funny this came out only 2 years after the Kutcher film. Also, Fassbender has a way cooler vibe that the actual Jobs&mldr; I mean, he’s Magneto!</p><p><strong>The Social Network</strong></p><p>One of the wildest things about this movie is the that Facebook’s valuation at the time of the credits rolling was only $25 billion. A few years later, it’s nearly 500 billion. I left Facebook 3 years before this film came out, and briefly returned while in Portland. I get the sense the characters in the film might be less likable in real life.</p><p><strong>Apollo 13</strong></p><p>Such a fantastic film. It’s surprising how well this held up, with many practical effects and no terrible CGI. It’s been 25 years and this one still had me on the edge of my seat.</p><p><strong>Overlord</strong></p><p>This felt a bit like a video game. Lots of nazis getting blown up? Weird underground lab? Strange NPCs? Check.</p><p><strong>Birds of Prey</strong></p><p>It’s a low bar, but this is definitely the best DCU movie since all the serious Nolan Batman films. Not only was it silly fun, it managed to build interesting characters and solid battles that put the overwrought CGI-fest of Avengers to shame. I hope if they make more of these they keep the formula. I really want to see a love story between Poison Ivy and Harley.</p><p><strong>1917</strong></p><p>A very intense movie but it was also beautiful in its own way. I get why this won awards. Weird cameo by Doctor Strange though.</p><p><strong>The Martian</strong></p><p>Another rewatch. I had a FaceTime call where my friend Lena and I discussed Halt and Catch Fire, which reminded me how much I enjoyed this film, which I took to be about the competence of McKenzie Davis’ character. This was my first time watching this movie in 4K though, which made it look pretty amazing. Also, I always forget Donald Glover was in this.</p><p><strong>Skyfall</strong></p><p>Perhaps one of the only movies to use a Land Rover Defender in a car chase, this is pure fun. The filming and action scenes were a wild step-up from the previous two films, and the stakes felt high throughout.</p><p><strong>Quantum of Solace</strong></p><p>Far less memorable than Casino Royale. The first chase was fun, but a lot of the rest of the film kinda just meanders. I do appreciate the little nods towards older James Bond films though.</p><p><strong>Casino Royale</strong></p><p>Rewatching this in preparation for the eventual release of the final Daniel Craig bond film. It holds pretty well, save for the hilariously old-looking Sony phones and bootcut khakis. I’d forgotten Mads Mikkelsen was in this.</p><p><strong>Contagion</strong></p><p>I saw this in the theater when it first came out, but I haven’t seen it since then. This felt like a timely movie considering our current circumstances. I forgot Jude Law plays a weird crank reporter.</p><p><strong>Jojo Rabbit</strong></p><p>A deeply strange film about learning how to be a person and unlearn fanaticism. There were some pretty excellent cameos in this, and a very dark comedic beat.</p><p><strong>Phantom Thread</strong></p><p>Wow, this movie was hilarious from top to bottom. A friend (hi Drew) invited me to see it for the first time in 70mm, and all I want to do is channel Woodcock every day. &ldquo;What am I supposed to do with that?". What a joy. I can&rsquo;t wait to watch this again.</p><p><strong>First Love</strong></p><p>A strange mistaken gangster film. This was much more straightforward than many Takeshi Miike films, but still managed to add in some really bizarre bits, and even some surprises.</p><p><strong>Elle</strong></p><p>Yow. That was&mldr; a lot of movie. Isabelle Huppert was fantastic, but I don&rsquo;t know if I could recommend it. Definitely one of the stranger Verhoeven movies I&rsquo;ve seen.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong></p><p>Another lady assassin movie. It was a helluva ride and I enjoyed it. I don’t think it added anything huge to the genre, but I’m just glad to have more cool movies about tough women. That said, I wish Anna had been able to just be with her girlfriend instead of randomly fucking spymasters.</p><p><strong>Gennocidal Organ</strong></p><p>I read the book this movie is based on last year, and it’s a truly brutal story of linguistics and massive unrest. This movie is grim in a way that feels a little too prescient. Definitely one of the better anime thrillers I’ve seen in a while though.</p><p><strong>Psycho Pass Movie Trilogy</strong></p><p>After season 3, Psycho Pass had a trilogy of films in Japan. They’re fun continuations of the characters from all three seasons, and a bit of a sequel to the first movie. The future this film presents is pretty grim, but the animation is fantastic.</p><p><strong>Weathering With You</strong></p><p>I found out I don’t need to worry about climate change because it’s just rain, ya know? This film was gorgeous and fun and o loved the cat in it with my entire heart.</p><p><strong>Matrix: Reloaded</strong></p><p>Really starting the year off right. We talked through most of the exposition, which was like 75% of the movie. I hadn’t seen this since it came out, and it really didn’t hold up.</p><p><strong>The Lighthouse</strong></p><p>The first thing I noticed in this film was the tight, constrained feel of a square frame with deep black and white images. I immediately had to look around for <a href=https://www.musicbed.com/blog/filmmaking/cinematography/breaking-down-the-cinematography-of-the-lighthouse/>how this was made</a>. The VVitch is one of my favorite movies of all time, and Eggers doesn&rsquo;t disappoint in this haunting film either. The dread builds as the antipathy between the two men grows. A joy.</p><h2 id=movie-archivemoviearchive><a href=/moviearchive>movie archive</a></h2></div><div class=post-tags></div><div class=footer><ul class=flat><li><a href=/index.xml title=rss><img src=/rss.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brookshelley title=rss><img src=/twitter.svg alt="twitter icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://buttondown.email/brookshelley title=newsletter><img src=/mail.svg alt="rss icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brookshelley title=github><img src=/github.svg alt="github icon" height=20 width=20></a></li><li><a href=/about title=about><img src=/info.svg alt="info icon" height=20 width=20></a></li></ul>brook 2020</div></div></body></html>
