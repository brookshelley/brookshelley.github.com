      <description>The Playlist Here&amp;rsquo;s all the albums I really loved this year easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.
The Albums  Cheap Queen — King Princess  Bless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.
Emily Alone — Florist  A deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.</description>

      <description>in no particular order On Apple Music
The list Dilly Dally Heaven: I listened to this amazing band’s first album so much in the three years since it came out, and the vocal delivery is raw and beautiful. A true jam.
Ex:Re Ex:Re: A delightfully sad and smart album about lost love, and healing. This was a late-arrival this year, and has already been a constant repeat.
Anna McClellan Yes and No: A similarly raw singing style to Dilly Dally, this is a bummer jam.</description>
