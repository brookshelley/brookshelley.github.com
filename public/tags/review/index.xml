<p>Or, how I reprogrammed my brain to understand an ortholinear keyboard.</p>
<p>During my work from home, I’ve slowly upgraded my computing setup to keep me from constant soreness. First, it was a real deal office chair and desk, then a monitor. Finally this week, I added a split keyboard to alleviate wrist issues.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-keyboards">A history of keyboards</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/keyboardhistory.jpg" alt="">
For years I’ve written primarily on a MacBook or iPad keyboard, which is pretty cramped and ensures my trainer tells me to do more ITY stretches all the time. In the office I tried using a Microsoft Sculpt for some time, but I hated their weird wireless dongle. Not only was it frustrating to put a nubbin in a USB-A port, but it seemed to interfere with other ports or wireless signals.</p>
<p>A number of friends are huge mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, and I’d seen them around work pretty constantly, but I never really wanted one. For me, a woman who enjoys the MacBook 2015-2018 keyboard, and the iPad Smart and Magic keyboards, I didn’t think I would enjoy the force required to activate the keys, or the longer travel. I also worried that in an effort to move to a more ergonomic keyboard, I might ruin my ability to type on a regular one. I still don’t know what made me take the plunge, but I bought an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">Ergodox </a> to get going.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/ergodox.jpg" alt="">
Plugging in my Ergodox, my first thought was, “this is so utterly weird!” I quickly realized I’d need to program my keyboard to more closely match what I’m accustomed to on a Magic keyboard, which meant I spent quite some time on Oryx (their graphical configuration tool). After a few missteps and missing keys (turns out not having a <code>= +</code> key can be an problem, who knew?!), I settled on this:
<img src="/photos/ergodoxlayout.jpg" alt="">
Loading the configuration was super simple, and blazingly fast, which encouraged me to experiment and play around with new buttons. I gave myself quick keys for Alfred and Spotlight, as well as some easy copy and pastes.</p>
<p>I quickly learned I had some issues with overreaching various keys, like the <code>b</code>, and I would need quite a bit of practice before I stopped saying “damn, damn, damn,” and frantically backspacing. My coworkers this week have seen a huge increase in accidental messages, until I figured out a better place for my enter key than “exactly where my quote key was before”.</p>
<h2 id="week-two">Week two</h2>
<p>I’m slowly finding a rhythm with typing alphabetical characters, but I think it will be quite some time until I’m able to quickly choose random characters. I’m trying to learn which characters I use most often, to ensure they live somewhere on my first layer, and my second layer is dedicated to the rarely used characters that I don’t mind looking down to find. Without keycaps that reflect the layers I will definitely run into the issue of not being able to look down to remind myself of where things are, so maybe I’ll pin a screenshot indefinitely on my desktop.</p>
<p>A few friends who’ve used these keyboards assured me I wouldn’t be ruined for regular layouts by using the Ergodox, but I’ve already found myself trying to backspace on the left side of the keyboard or hit the area around the spacebar to press enter. I think I should be able to type on two different keyboard layouts in turn eventually, but for now it’s still confusing.</p>
<p>My WPM went from an abysmal 50 to ~65 after the first week of use, and my hope is that it keeps climbing back up to my more usual 85+. It’s still too early after two weeks to tell if the Ergodox is helping my wrist and shoulder issues, but they at least aren’t exacerbated.</p>
<h3 id="fun-with-keys">Fun with keys</h3>
<p>I quickly learned after ordering my keyboard that there are myriad custom options from keys to cables, not to mention different switches that you can replace. I ordered a few keys and a few cables to play around with the aesthetics, but other than a shorter TRRS cable, I don’t think any change has really effected my use much. I put purple keys into the spots for alt, ctrl, and command mostly to help hone in on those modifier keys whenever I get lost.</p>
<p>A word of warning: many awesome keysets are group buys with long lead-times, so it’s best to think of ordering a few and then forget about them and have the package as a surprise later.</p>
<h2 id="moonlander">Moonlander</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/moonlanderlayout.jpg" alt="">
Imagine my surprise, a week after getting a new Ergodox when ZSA announced a <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">new keyboard</a> just as I settled into using mine. I couldn’t resist the siren song of “next-generation ergonomics” or the idea that this keyboard would be more portable, so I picked my second ZSA keyboard in black and waited for it to arrive from Taiwan.</p>
<h2 id="week-three">Week three</h2>
<p>The clack of the keyboard tells me I’m back at work, and at my desk again for the next 4 days.</p>
<h2 id="week-nine">Week nine</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/moonlander.jpg" alt="">
After quite a few weeks with my Ergodox, my Moonlander arrived. I immediately set it up, then forgot what the default layout was. Eventually I got Wally launched and loaded my layout, only to tweak it a bit to make some of the keys more usable. The big red keys are a little challenging to hit, but my main issue was finding a good command layout for doing cmd+k in Slack constantly. It’s funny how the keyboard shortcuts that are so common become so integral to how your keyboard is laid out. Perhaps I’ll make single key macros at some point too.</p>
<p>By the time my Moonlander arrived at the end of September, I’d become pretty accustomed to my Ergodox, and been through a dozen or so tweaked layouts. My typing speed is around 85wpm again, but the most important part is my wrists and hands feel way better￼. I went with Brown switches for both of these keyboards, and even though they’re not very clunky I feel pretty happy with the sound. Surprisingly, typing on the iPad Magic Keyboard still feels nice￼ too. When I first started using these new keyboards I worried that the cognitive load of hopping between them and a regular layout would be too much, but so far, it’s easy. I don’t relish the idea of doing a Dvorak setup though.￼</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Switching from a standard keyboard to an ortholinear mechanical keyboard is no mean feat. I definitely struggled the past few weeks with various issues typing rare, but important keys, as well as remapping my brain to remember where I’d put everything. Overall though, for the comfort and feel, I think it’s worth it to try one. We’re stuck at home in the states for at least 6 more months, so why not take up a weird keyboard hobby in the meantime.</p>

      <description>Backpacking gear With flying out of the question, especially to other countries, I decided to do a bit of local adventuring.</description>
      <content:encoded><h1 id="backpacking-gear">Backpacking gear</h1>
<p>With flying out of the question, especially to other countries, I decided to do a bit of local adventuring. With the encouragement and planning of some Slack pals, I began to plan for a few days of backpacking, and more importantly, a few days of gear. Anyone who’s read my blog for a bit knows I’m a nerd about backpacks, technical clothing, and having the absolute minimum amount of stuff with me on trips. At home, I live pretty comfortably, but when I’m out of the house, I love the deep thrill of having exactly what I need.</p>
<p>The last camping trip I went on was during the eclipse 3 years ago in Dallas, Oregon. We drove there, and barely had to hike to put down our gear, so I brought a blow-up couch, a Nintendo switch, and medium-weight backpacking gear. I had an old REI sleeping bag that I’ve used for years, a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/864138/mountain-hardwear-optic-25-tent">Mountain Hardware Optic 2.5 tent</a>, and a few jugs of water. All my gear, with 2 gallons of water hanging outside my pack as I was used to desert camping in Texas, weighed a bit over 25lbs, without food. This is pretty great for a car camping or one night camping situation, butI love going further and not having nearly as much on my back, plus I needed to bring food in my bag because I wouldn’t have a cooler with me on this upcoming trip.</p>
<p>Thus began my list:</p>
<h3 id="total-weight-337kg-or-744lbs">Total weight: 3.37kg or 7.44lbs</h3>
<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/nemo.jpg" alt="nemo"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1275.72g <a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/camping-and-hiking/backpacking-tent/nemo-dragonfly-2">Nemo Dragonfly</a></p>
<p>This is a new addition to my list, but so far it seems neat, albeit very small. If I needed to spend extended time in a tent, I’d probably want something larger, but for a spot to sleep I think this will do just fine. I replaced the stakes with 60g of <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/tents/tent-accessories/groundhog-tent-stakes/05807.html">MSR groundhog stakes</a>.
<img src="/photos/nemopacked.jpg" alt="nemopacked"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60g <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/tents/tent-accessories/groundhog-tent-stakes/05807.html">MSR Groundhog tent stakes</a></p>
<p>Dependable light stakes. I’ve bent one of these only once when applying my full body weight through my foot into hard ground. In most cases this is very chill. I’ll probably dig a hole in the future, or possibly not even use stakes depending on the setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/photos/sleepsystem.jpg" alt="sleep system"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>455.01 <a href="https://enlightenedequipment.com/revelation-stock/">Enlightened Equipment Revelation</a></p>
<p>My most recent trip was with my old sleeping bag, and I spent the entire night with it open due to the heat. I learned that my air mattress is super comfy even sleeping directly on it, and that I made the right decision to switch to a quilt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>340g <a href="https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite-air-mattress">Thermarest Neoair XLite air mattress</a></p>
<p>This is a big comfort upgrade over my Z-Packs folding mat, even though it’s definitely more annoying to blow up and deflate. I sleep on my side often, so I like knowing I can adjust this a bit to facilitate that instead of basically sleeping on a thin foam cover over bits of rock. I might try bringing the inflation sack to save my lungs, and maybe I’ll store clothes in it or something in the meantime.
<img src="/photos/nemoinside.jpg" alt="inside Nemo"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-213073">Weight: 2130.73</h3>
<h2 id="bag">Bag</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/hyperlitebag.jpg" alt="hyperlite"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>904g <a href="https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/2400-junction">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Junction 2400</a></p>
<p>This bag is outstanding. It’s so, so light, while still being incredibly tough, and roomy. It’s rated at 40L, but seems absolutely to be an endless bag of holding. I love that it has waist pockets for snacks, and a few webbing loops on the shoulder straps for a water bottle or a phone or camera.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-904g">Weight: 904g</h3>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/cookingsystem.jpg" alt="cooking system"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>72g <a href="https://www.toaksoutdoor.com/collections/frontpage/products/pot-550-l">Toaks titanium pot</a></p>
<p>Another new addition. Up until now I used the terra system that came with my crux lite, but never used both pots. I can’t fit my fuel and my stove inside with the lid, but that’s totally fine. I love that I can easily use this as a mug too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>72g <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/146426/optimus-crux-lite-stove">Crux lite stove</a></p>
<p>Absolutely my favorite stove. It’s effective, quick and super light. I’ve used this for years, and it’s always worked save for the time I was trying to boil water with a 50mph wind blowing at me. Eventually, I hid behind a car and was able to make coffee.
<img src="/photos/foodbag.jpg" alt="food bag">
food bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16g <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/titanium-spork">Snow Peak Spork</a></p>
<p>I’ve had this spork for a long time—even before Snow Peak was cool again. Like, seriously I think I’ve eaten meals with this spork for 15 years. Love it. Durable and delightful. Mine is purple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ursa bear bag</p>
<p>This bag is only approved at certain campsites, but should be nice for those as an alternative to a rigid bear canister.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-270g-terra-stoves-471g">Weight: 270g (Terra stoves 471g)</h3>
<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/assortedcamp.jpg" alt="tech gear and other accessories"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>188g <a href="https://bookriot.com/amazon-kindle-oasis-review/">Kindle Oasis</a></p>
<p>My entire library can camp with me without adding bulk or weight. Plus, it’s waterproof!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>188g iPhone 11 Pro</p>
<p>Basically whatever the latest phone from Apple is, I’ll have it. This one is great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>192g 10000mAh external USB battery</p>
<p>Keeps my iPhone, watch, and AirPods charged. This one is very small, and only has one USB-C and one USB-A port, so I do a little juggling of plugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20g Assorted cables</p>
<p>A small Satechi watch charger and a C to Lighting and C to C cable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) 416.74 Anker Solar charger</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-588g-98474g-with-a-solar-charger">Weight: 588g (984.74g with a solar charger)</h3>
<h2 id="assorted-gear">Assorted gear</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>14.7g <a href="https://kulacloth.com">Kula cloth</a></p>
<p>A recent trip was my first time using this cloth, and largely it ruled! My one big mistake was getting a little too much camp soap on it, and having to wash it for a while to remove the soap. I think I can probably safely avoid soap for a couple days, and just wash it off with water.
<img src="/photos/befree.jpg" alt="befree bag"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70g <a href="https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/14946-8019639-katadyn-beefree-0.6L_usa">Katadyn BeFree bottle with filter</a></p>
<p>This water filter sack is outstanding. The flow rate is super fast and the entire setup is light AF. I also picked-up a 3L version of the same setup for group camping or if I think I’ll be away from water sources for longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70g Matador water bottle</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a straw with the ability to bite to get water, which makes this easy for drinking on the trail.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>113.40g <a href="https://www.miir.com/collections/pourigami-travel-coffee-system/products/pourigami-portable-travel-coffee-dripper">Miir Pouragami</a></p>
<p>This is a little heavy to bring along if I’m hiking a lot, but it’s hard to beat the ability to do a pour over for friends. Usually I’ll bring <a href="https://canyoncoffee.co/collections/coffee/products/instant-coffee">fancy instant coffee</a> instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>46g <a href="https://www.opinel-usa.com/products/opinel-knives-no-7-carbon-steel-folding-knife">Opinel knife</a></p>
<p>A fantastic classic knife. This is good for cooking or various cutting tasks. It’s not the lightest but I dig it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-1547-2681g-with-pourigami">Weight: 154.7 (268.1g with pourigami)</h3>
<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Icebreaker merino shirt</p>
<p>This is my standard shirt that I wear almost every day. It’s great, comfortable, and light. It also keeps me warm and dry most of the time, and stands up to hand-washing well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coalatree trailhead pants</p>
<p>I used these pants on a recent trip, and was a excited about the pillow feature of the pockets, but ultimately it was a little uncomfortable so I might try something different next trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports bra</p>
<p>Sometimes this is wool, but it’s always wicking. No cotton here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Icebreaker merino underwear</p>
<p>Dries quick, doesn’t get too stinky, and is comfy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Darn tough merino socks</p>
<p>I’ve had a bunch of merino and other material socks, and I keep coming back to these. They’re comfy, wash and dry quickly, and keep my feet comfy for hikes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merino buff</p>
<p>Works as a hat, a scarf, a temp face cover, and even as a wrap for my improvised pillow that is a bit softer. Love it. I’d resisted getting a buff for years, but frankly, I was a fool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/photos/onshoes.jpg" alt="on shoes"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.on-running.com/en-us/products/cloudventure-peak">On Cloudventure Peak</a> shoes</p>
<p>I’ve never worn hiking shoes or boots on backpacking trips or even to hike—I’ve never even owned any! I picked these up to help mitigate my slippiness on loose terrain, as the last time I went hiking I kept falling down. Hopefully these are comfy and grippy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>311g <a href="https://www.teva.com/women-sandals/original-universal/1003987.html?dwvar_1003987_color=CYR#start=3&amp;cgid=women-sandals">Teva sandals camp shoes</a></p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ll bring trail sandals on every trip, but they’re super comfy and I enjoy being able to take off my shoes at the end of the day but still wander around camp a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jacket</p>
<p>This depends on the conditions, but either a <a href="https://huckberry.com/store/proof/category/p/60691-shift-packable-shell">Proof shell</a> or a <a href="https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-torre-womens-high-performance-windpro-hoodie-jacket">Mission Workshop Torre jacket</a>. If it’s particularly cold or rainy, I also have a <a href="https://hiconsumption.com/snow-peak-fire-resistant-outerwear/">Snow Peak FR trench</a>. I tend to get warm pretty easily, but hate getting super soaked, so I optimize for staying dry and layer a bit. The FR trench plus my Torre worked well for me down to -5C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hat</p>
<p>Merino wool watch cap from <a href="https://www.tannergoods.com/collections/hats">Tanner Goods</a>. This hat is excellent and has kept my head and ears warm in four or five countries. It also doesn’t get too stinky when it’s been hiked in a lot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="camping-report">Camping report</h2>
<p>I’ve only camped once with a lot of this gear, and eagerly wait for the end of fire season so I can do a bit more camping. Ultimately, it performed well but I’m excited to see how nice it is to hike with so little weight and set up shop in my little Nemo tent.

      <title>A GR III review</title>

      <description>A GRIII Review A street photography camera for empty streets In the before times, I travelled a lot. On average I flew 25 times a year, and left the country on 2-4 of those trips.</description>
      <content:encoded><h1 id="a-griii-review">A GRIII Review</h1>
<h2 id="a-street-photography-camera-for-empty-streets">A street photography camera for empty streets</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/gr3f.jpg" alt="ricoh grIII"></p>
<p>In the before times, I travelled a lot. On average I flew 25 times a year, and left the country on 2-4 of those trips. I&rsquo;ve written a <em>lot</em> about traveling light, so it won&rsquo;t surprise you that I usually bring my iPhone as my sole camera. A few years ago, I picked-up a Canon G9X Mark II to take with me to Singapore and Reykjavik.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/singapore.jpg" alt="singapore"> <img src="/photos/reykjavik.jpg" alt="reykjavik"></p>
<p>While I enjoyed the size of the camera, and the high-quality shots, at the end of those trips, I largely stopped taking it with me because the trade-off in packing wasn&rsquo;t worth the gain. It was a little too frustrating to carry <em>one more thing</em> with me while hiking or wandering the city too.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/gr3b.jpg" alt="ricoh grIII back"></p>
<p>With that said, it likely seems strange that I just bought a Ricoh GRIII, especially during a pandemic when it&rsquo;s unlikely I&rsquo;ll be going much of anywhere. What convinced me to try the second camera thing again was both a lingering desire for a GR that I&rsquo;d acquired when friends had film Ricohs in college, and a little bit of wanting to focus on shooting photos and not immediately sharing them with the world. It also doesn&rsquo;t hurt to have a new hobby that encourages me to walk and ride my bike around.</p>
<h2 id="carrying-it-around">Carrying it around</h2>
<p>In the short time since my trips to Iceland and Singpore, sling bags became very trendy, and with them, the easy way to bring a camera and nod much else along for an adventure. With nothing more than my phone, a usb to lightning cable, and my GRIII I can take photos, transfer them quickly, and edit them using <a href="https://darkroom.co">Darkroom</a> or <a href="https://www.polarr.com">Polarr</a>. When it&rsquo;s chilly, or I&rsquo;m on a bike ride, I can either stuff this into my jacket or a <a href="https://www.orucase.com/collections/accessories/products/the-smuggler-handlebar-bag?variant=32785756815499">bike bag</a>, and my hands are unburdened. I also picked-up a <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/products/type-17-camera-sling-strap">strap from DSPTCH</a> so I can wear my camera when biking or walking. I&rsquo;ve found in the past that it&rsquo;s pretty helpful to have a stabilizer strap as well, so I added one to my kit.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/grstrap.jpg" alt="dsptchstrap"></p>
<p>With a bag or a strap like this, I&rsquo;ve found that sans-flying, just carrying the camera around is very easy, especially if I shoot regularly during my walk. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to bring a spare battery in a pocket too. When I had my Canon with me on trips, I made the mistake of not having a sling pack or a strap for it, so there was a lot of hassle that I&rsquo;ve now solved.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>In the last section, I mentioned bringing a spare battery. Usually digital cameras shoot for 250-400 shots between charges, but the GRIII seems to be on the low end of that scale. I&rsquo;ve only gone through one charge so far over a few shooting sessions, but the copious warnings online about the battery life meant I immediately ordered a spare and keep it with me <em>just in case</em>. I got two Wasabi spares with a charger for cheaper than a first-party battery, and so far they seem to not cause issues. An incredibly convenient feature on the GRIII is that I can plug the camera body into a USB-C battery or my iPad to charge it up pretty quickly even if I&rsquo;m not near a spare or a wall socket.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/grcables.jpg" alt="cables"></p>
<p>Whereas my Canon camera used micro USB like my damn Kindle (c&rsquo;mon Amazon, put a USB-C port in the Kindle already), the GRIII uses a USB-C port like my computer and iPad, which means I only need to bring a single cable to charge any of those devices. I bought a USB-C to SD card reader as well, because it&rsquo;s pretty nice to take out the SD card, and plug it into my iPad after shooting, especially if I want to go somewhere else to edit photos without my camera. Ricoh also offers an iOS app to do remote shooting, or transfers, but the speed seems to be a little slow, so I would likely only use this feature in an emergency. Part of the appeal of a camera that <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a phone is thoughtfulness and not rushing to get a photo onto my site or micro.blog, so having a little barrier there is relaxing.</p>
<p>Previously, I would&rsquo;ve scoffed at this, but then the pandemic happened, and I reevaluated my relationship with Twitter after leaving Instagram a few years ago. Plus, my iPhone is totally fine still for joke photos if I some reactji on Slack.</p>
<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/menus.jpg" alt="menu"></p>
<p>There are a bunch of nicely resistant buttons on the GRIII, as well as a surprisingly-good touchscreen for the rest of the selections. I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of processor is in this camera, but it&rsquo;s fast and responsive when I&rsquo;m deleting, zooming, or changing settings. Additionally, it&rsquo;s as easy as thumbing the DISP button to cycle through screen options while shooting, including turning the screen off. I haven&rsquo;t used a ton of digital cameras, but this is easily my favorite menu system and settings selection.</p>
<h2 id="shooting">Shooting</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to actually shoot photos with the Ricoh?</p>
<p>In a word, fantastic.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/grflowers.jpg" alt="ricohphoto"></p>
<p>Between the incredibly quick startup, fast burst, and great lens, every time I want to shoot a photo I can do so easily. I don&rsquo;t mind walking to zoom, and am pretty used to it with my iPhone, so the 28mm lens is a delight. Even without a tilting screen, it&rsquo;s pretty simple to know what I&rsquo;m shooting, and capture the image even without looking at the screen, especially with the snap focus option which lets me choose an automatic focus range for a full-press of the shutter button. I&rsquo;d heard a little bit about focus hunting, but I&rsquo;ve found that generally the GRIII finds faces and objects with ease. I also love mode selection ring with a lock, to ensure I don&rsquo;t accidentally revert to P or M when I wanted my own user setting—oh and there&rsquo;s 3 of those.</p>
<p>The video, as many other reviewers have stated, isn&rsquo;t very good, but if I want to shoot video (which is rare), my iPhone is just fine.</p>

      <title>iPad Magic Keyboard Review</title>

      <description>Watching friends and reviewers get their new Magic Keyboards in the mail all week was brutal, because every word I read about them, and video I watched just made me want to touch one more.</description>
      <content:encoded><p><img src="/photos/magickeyboard.jpg" alt="iPad and Magic Keyboard"></p>
<p>Watching friends and reviewers get their new Magic Keyboards in the mail all week was brutal, because every word I read about them, and video I watched just made me want to touch one more. In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.</p>
<p>In a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="heavy">Heavy</h2>
<p>My first thought when I took the Magic Keyboard package out of the mailbox was, “yow, this <em>is</em> heavy.” After taking the keyboard out of its packaging, the heft remained, but once I attached my iPad to it and started typing, I forgot all about the weight. Sure, this will be a bit heavier for travel, but the modularity is worth it for me. I can’t wait to type on this while traveling, then pull the iPad off the keyboard to carry around for reading in a park, or watching a tv show. It makes me wish it were possible to pull the screen off of my work computer and walk around with it too!</p>
<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>
<p>Ever since getting the Smart Keyboard, my iPad basically never left it. I carried my iPad around daily, fingers pressed into the keys awkwardly on the back of the screen. The previous keyboard for the iPad was also super strange in its own way, but looking back, having a primary iPad case expose you to the keyboard buttons constantly when all you want to do is read is so silly. This new Magic Keyboard makes no concessions to using it while <em>not</em> typing. The ease of removing the iPad from the keyboard (I’m almost tempted to call it a dock) is such that I don’t even think about taking my iPad with me to another room, sans keyboard. This mode-changing makes the iPad feel even more futuristic than it did before, especially because my hands are only now becoming accustomed to the thin, metallic body of the iPad, instead of the strange rubber skin of the keyboard case its lived in up until now.</p>
<h2 id="thunk">Thunk</h2>
<p>So, what’s the keyboard actually like to type on?</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Unlike most folks, I really enjoyed both the butterfly keyboard in my MacBook, and the cloth-covered one on the Smart Keyboard. I enjoyed the short-travel, and the weird texture, but the feel and thunk of this new keyboard is even better. I don’t really care about the backlighting, and I’m a little bit more concerned about the gaps that invite in stray drops of water, but as I mentioned above, I don’t plan to carry this with me all the time, so it’s more likely I’ll have a glass of wine sans non-waterproof keyboard, and keep drinks away when I plan to <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>I typed this review on the new keyboard, and the experience was absolutely fantastic. The new trackpad <em>is</em> small, but the ability to quickly laser-target my edits is a delight. No longer do I have to tap, stab, tap tap, arrow, arrow, arrow. I can just point, and click, and voila. When I’m not at work, I more or less <em>only</em> use my iPad, and this new keyboard means the typing I do will be faster, feel better, and even sound more pleasingly thunky.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-it">Should you buy it?</h2>
<p>Do you type on your iPad? Do you want to? Have you been tempted to plug your iPad into a monitor and use a Bluetooth trackpad? Do you love writing on the go?</p>
<p>If so, then this is probably the right keyboard for you. If you only occasionally reach for your iPad to watch YouTube videos, or are the kind of person who thinks traveling with an iPad <strong>and</strong> a MacBook is totally acceptable, then save your $300. In the same way that I’ve never purchased an Apple Pencil, many iPad users will never purchase this keyboard, and I think that’s totally fine. But the folks that do buy one, and get to experience the entirely wonderful experience of typing and editing will be incredibly satisfied, I think.</p>

      <title>Bellroy Studio Pack Review</title>

      <description>A new backpack for everyday carry, and travel.
First Sight After first getting my new Bellroy sling, I fell in love with the delightful material for these bags.</description>
      <content:encoded><p><img src="/photos/bellroybackpack.jpeg" alt="Bellroy Studio Backpack"></p>
<p>A new backpack for everyday carry, and travel.</p>
<h2 id="first-sight">First Sight</h2>
<p>After first getting my new Bellroy sling, I fell in love with the delightful material for these bags. A few months later in Iitoya in Japan, I got to see their new Shift backpack in person, and almost bought one on the spot. that bag was a little larger than I need, but then I saw <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/studio-backpack/venture/black">this</a>. With the launch of the Studio Backpack, Bellroy has made an excellent bag that holds a little or a lot without every looking absurd.</p>
<h2 id="sizing">Sizing</h2>
<p>For quite a while, I’ve <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/11/06/devreltour-packing-list.html">brought my Topo Trip Pack</a> to work as it fits my coffee bottle, iPad, journal, and a few other things perfectly. Adding in a spare jacket could stuff it pretty tight, but I preferred that to hauling a bag that was typically too large. With the Studio Backpack, my everyday stuff fits well, with ample space, but the shallow depth of the bag means it looks nice even unloaded.</p>
<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>
<p>This is a slim, but tall-ish bag that measures 500L x 370W x 100D mm or 19.69”x14.57”x3.94”.</p>
<p>It has an 18-liter capacity, which while entry isn’t nearly as big feeling as my similarly-sized RYU Quick Pack. It weighs 650g or 1.43lbs, nearly half the weight of the <a href="https://ryu.com/shop/us/quick-pack/quick-pack-lux">RYU</a>, and only a little heavier than the 567g <a href="https://topodesigns.com/products/trip-pack?variant=946319253">Topo Trip Pack</a>.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this bag feels like a great balance between a daily size and one that I could fly around the world with.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/bellroysmall.jpg" alt="Bellroy Front Pocket"></p>
<p>This bag is a top-loader, with a generously-wide opening, and a fidlock magnetic closure I can open with one hand using the small fabric loop. This flap makes for an easy way to use the main compartment, while keeping the rain off of my stuff. On the outside, there’s a pocket a little bit lower than mid-way that zips shut, and has pockets for pens, AirPods, and a few other things along with a key loop on a long fabric loop. Usually, I keep a Hobonichi Weeks, a Kaweco fountain pen, house keys, AirPods Pro and my work badge in here.</p>
<p>Inside of the main bag area, there’s a laptop area that can hold up to a 16” MacBook Pro—the new one with the real escape key—or an iPad Pro of either size. The bottom of the bag is generously padded to keep your stuff safe, and the laptop sleeve ends before the bottom for more safety. On the front wall of the main bag opening there is another zipped compartment for glasses, cables, or other odds and ends that you don’t need as often.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/mainbellroy.jpg" alt="Bellroy Main Pocket"></p>
<h2 id="colors-and-materials">Colors and Materials</h2>
<p>I have the black version of this bag, which I find delightful, though if I could customize it, I might have chosen a light purple or blue interior instead of the tan it comes with from Bellroy. Bellroy won me over on the idea that a lighter or brighter interior helps in finding your gear, though as a top-loader, even bright fabric doesn’t help you dig at the bottom of the bag. The Venture Weave fabric feels very strange, but in a cool, high-end way, and does a good job shrugging off rain. There are leather accents in various places on the bag that give it a little extra luxury.</p>
<h2 id="rating">Rating</h2>
<p>This bag rules, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it for the past few weeks. I plan to take it on my next trip abroad, and likely won’t bring a separate daypack. I think this bag will be comfortable on a hike, or fully-loaded with my typical travel gear. If you need a bit more space, I highly recommend checking out Bellroy’s other larger version of this, the <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/shift-backpack/venture/moss">Shift pack</a>.</p>

<p>This year marked my 4th XOXO, and my 3rd at Revolution Hall. Last year was <em>big</em>, which meant it was even harder to wave at, or spend time with the other amazing attendees I knew. This year, it felt just right. I still waved at too many folks, and wished I had time to have a number of small dinners over the next year instead of so many “hey, I see you, sorry I’ve gotta run!” However, I got to spend time with a smallish group of friends, see all the talks I wanted, and even play some <a href="http://www.killerqueenblack.com">amazing</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ_I8SSVKto">new</a> <a href="https://play.date">games</a>.
If you’ve never been to XOXO, and you make things on the internet, and enjoy building relationships, this is a great place for you.</p>
<h2 id="day-one">Day one</h2>
<p>As usually, the first day of the conference was a social one—with Glitch doing an <a href="https://glitch.com/~appy-hour">Appy Hour</a>, and Panic showing off the <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>. It was super cool seeing all the strange community games and creations of Glitch users, along with a few presentations, and the Playdate is something I can’t wait to own. Topped-off with a dinner at Kachka, a lot of upcoming games, and one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/9/9/20849172/unraveled-how-to-calculate-pet-hp-hit-points">most hilarious videos</a> I’ve seen in a while, wherein Brian Gilbert attempts to calculate his pet’s HP, Friday was a delight. The weather held, the <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1171647388001406976?s=21">toilets were uniquely chill</a>, and the layout of the festival ensure I could wander and find neat things.</p>
<h2 id="day-two">Day two</h2>
<p>One of the first pieces of advice I’d give anyone going to a multi-day festival is “don’t drink too much on the first night”. I didn’t take my own advice. I wasn’t ill, but a combination of 3 glasses of wine and too little sleep meant 10am felt <em>very</em> early. Thankfully my hotel had Proud Mary coffee, and XOXO had Deadstock. A breakfast sandwich from Fried Egg I’m in Love completed my resurrection.</p>
<p>Day two felt a little longer, as I sat through every talk, alternately crying and laughing. A definite emotional rollercoaster. Helen and Hrishikesh were excellent hosts, and seeing their banter develop over the weekend makes me hope they host again next year. I missed the Andy’s camaraderie at times, but I hope <em>only</em> being responsible for the whole festival was a nice change from also MCing.</p>
<p>Lunch was Basilisk. Unbeatable fried chicken I eat every time I visit Portland. Yes, even when I’m there for hours.</p>
<p>Favorite talks from Saturday: Harry Brewis (very funny guy who I didn’t know anything about beforehand), Hundred Rabbits (delightful French Canadian vegan sailors), and Soleil Ho (what happens when you become the representation?!).</p>
<p>After a quick dinner, I sat down for a night of unforgettable podcasts. I watched a man interview a chainsaw, and was utterly destroyed by Demi and Miel with special guests Neil and Mike doing Ray Parker Jr’s Ghostbuster song. The number of folks I heard singing “bustin’ makes me feel good” after this podcast taping tells me I wasn’t alone.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-closing-time">Day 3 (Closing time)</h2>
<p>Coffee. Sandwich. Almost there. I was wiped at this point, but the talks were delightful. Mikki Kendall, Jenny Odell, and Rhea Butcher were my favorites from Sunday. A great mix of comedy and art. Food highlights were Navarre (another favorite), and dinner at Sardine Head. OMG Sardine Head. Oxidated white wine. Salt-cured anchovy. Dang.</p>
<p>The karaoke list was full by the time my friends and I got back from dinner, and a cab ride that included an episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1170902500083322880?s=21">King of the Hill</a>. It was fun watching various speakers and friends sing Pavement, Lizzo, and of course, the Ghostbuster’s theme. I ended my night with my friends Jenny and Joe, drinking on the balcony at my hotel. Our friend André’s room was right by the balcony, and he wandered out mid-way through. That moment of kismet was generally how the whole conference felt—friends wandering by, saying hi, and going on adventures.</p>
<h2 id="a-great-year">A great year</h2>
<p>XOXO at its best feels like what I imagine a community <em>should</em> feel like. It’s full of new people, old people, dear friends, and acquaintances. If XOXO was every day, I would lose my mind, but once a year, it feels incredible to be surrounded by so many people I care about, as we’re inspired together by talks, art, and each other. I’m so glad I got to go to Portland, for the first time as a non-resident, for XOXO. I can’t wait for another year of this magical festival, and hope many of the same folks will get to attend. My only regret is that I can’t somehow bring Snorri with me too. He’d hate it.</p>

      <content:encoded><p>I wish I knew more about art. Reading the titular story, I found myself reaching for my phone to understand each scene in the strange and delightful post-apocalyptic tale. As I held the painting in my mind, and explored the flooded wastes with Liam, Nell, and Co. I found myself enamored by the framing. How often are our relationships held together by a retelling of an old picture? Are we always trying to build a life out of the classics of our youth? There’s a survey of life, and an exploration of lost moments in these vignettes.</p>
<p>The opening tale of this collection plants us in Ohio, a place, we see, where even supportive friends or loved ones can’t save you from the yawning abyss. The suburban Olive Garden echoes in my mind with all the breadsticks I absorbed through my high school years. These youth were me, and the chasm felt real then too. From there, we follow a mother who lost a son, and a sliver of a life exploring a name—just enough of both to leave the reader wanting more. Then, a journey through art, mentioned above. It’s strange and beautiful, and a great opportunity to learn about the great works of fine art, if like this reviewer, you largely skipped-out on art class.</p>
<p>Finally, we readers are washed up on the shore, like so many dead fish, with a man watching a lodge, and time-displaced, dealing with an all-too-familiar moldy bathroom. A word of warning: if you’ve lived in the the Pacific Northwest, the squelch of wet tile will be all too real. This novella is reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, or another fairy tale of exploring a new land. The phrase “crotchal belch” made me laugh out loud. There are so many great turns of phrase in Masterworks. The story propelled me forward, alternately laughing and cringing. I wanted the protagonist to seize his agency, and change in the ways he so clearly desired. I find these characters at turns fascinating and deeply frustrating. There were so many places where I yelled, “say something” in my head, but this isn’t a story of success, but learning and remembering.</p>
<p>On the whole, I loved this book. Masterworks, by Simon Jacobs, is a fantastic collection of imagination, and creative bombast. At times it leans into magical realism, in others outright fantasy. There a slightly disjointed nature to these stories, as they’re collected over years of writing, and lead me to hope Simon writes more—a novel perhaps—in the future.</p>

      <description>Started in Japan Last year, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo before the countdown began, and landed in the evening of the 1st of January.</description>
      <content:encoded><h2 id="started-in-japan">Started in Japan</h2>
<p>Last year, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo before the countdown began, and landed in the evening of the 1st of January. Making my way to my rental apartment in Koenji, the city was quiet as folks celebrated with their family. It was a strange trip. I got to do my hatsumode at Meiji Jingu with thousands of people, and see the Emperor’s second to last speech before his groundbreaking abdication next year. Parks were closed, but fortunately, izakayas were open. My friend Magda met up with me later that week, and I showed her Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. It was her first trip to Japan, and we both had a blast eating food and visiting a cool ryokan.</p>
<h2 id="portland-interlude">Portland (interlude)</h2>
<p>I spent very little time in Portland this year, it felt like. I traveled slightly less than in 2017, but between bouncing back and forth to Oakland and San Francisco for work and various trips abroad, Snorri and my Portland friends saw me half of every month. I lifted as often as I could, and competed in two internal <a href="/blog/2018/08/14/powerlifting">powerlifting</a> meets. I kept running the board of directors for Basic Rights too. But increasingly, Portland felt like the wrong place for me. When I was in town, I often found myself spending lots of time alone, cooking and eating at home, or seeing movies solo. <a href="/blog/2018/09/10/xoxo-thoughts">XOXO this year</a> was fun, but the friends I spent most of it with were all from the bay. I’d made and lost many friends, and my energy was low. I started thinking more seriously about moving to Oakland during a really busy time at work, so it took a bit for things to settle. Once they did, my company was part of Slack, and I was suddenly moving to Emeryville. I’ll miss so many of my friends in Portland, but as living halfway there and the bay for a few years taught me, it’s a quick flight.</p>
<h2 id="berlin">Berlin</h2>
<p>My partner suggested offhandedly at one point that they were going to Europe for a conference, and that it would be cool to meet up in Berlin. I bit, and immediately booked tickets. We stayed in Neukölln, near Tempelhofer Fields, and I immediately fell for the city, the Berliner Weiss, and the vibe. More than a few folks I know have since or before moved to Berlin, and despite wild bureaucratic issues, it seems like a very interesting place to live. I ate tons of döner kebab, and loved visiting LiquidRom (a place I’d described as a brutalist day spa). Mads and I had never spent that long together, and it definitely brought us closer together. I flew home happy, and looking forward to visiting again, and had just about a week in Portland before I flew off again.</p>
<h2 id="copenhagen">Copenhagen</h2>
<p>This time, I was on my way via SFO to Copenhagen with my coworkers Brian and Mark to attend and run a booth at KubeCon. It was so, <em>so</em> busy. We ate a lot of smørrebrø, worked out in an old slaughterhouse, and generally had a blast. I spent an extra week there alone, with only a couple days a bit wasted by my conference-acquired cold. Vesterbro was really cool, though I still think it’s odd how many all-you-can-eat sushi places there were. I never rode a bike, which in retrospect is super odd, but I did drink a lot of aquavit, and ate a <em>ton</em> of wienerschnitzel. This turned out to be my last international trip of the year, despite my hope that I could get back to Japan in the fall.</p>
<h2 id="so-many-flights-to-sfo">So many flights to SFO</h2>
<p>Various circumstances meant I was flying back and forth to SFO more than once a month during the summer and early fall. There were early morning flights with afternoons returning to Portland for poorly-timed obligations. There were flights with friends, and lots of solo flights. Somehow I never quite managed to get status on a single airline. Near the end of my constant flying, I was happy to learn my new company wanted me to move to the bay by the end of October, and my friend Haley helpfully found me a lovely apartment near lots of friends at the edges of Emeryville and Berkeley. I signed the lease sight-unseen, on the assurance of my partner and the video they took that it was fantastic. It was, in fact, incredible. I finished up everything I could in Portland, had movers come, and took Snorri and myself to our new home.</p>
<h2 id="settling-into-a-new-eville-life">Settling into a new Eville life</h2>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2018/11/21/moving-to-the-bay.html">wrote about moving to Emeryville</a> a while ago, and since then it’s gotten even better. I feel like I’ve settled into a schedule here that includes powerlifting, seeing friends, and taking care of my growing plant collection. A very mild fall means I get to wear all my light jackets, and my short bus commute to work led to ample time reading. It’s been great only bringing an <a href="/blog/2018/11/07/new-ipad-review">iPad Pro</a> to and from work for the past few months, and I feel lucky I get to leave my work, and work computer at the office. The holidays were better than I feared, and I got to spend time with a few friends here in the bay, as well as enjoy candles, snacks, and books in my cozy home. It also rules to finally live in the same city as my partner, and figuring out a good cadence in our hangouts has been fun, if sometimes tricky. I hope to spend many more years here.</p>
<h2 id="looking-towards-2019">Looking towards 2019</h2>
<p>I’m hopeful 2019 will lead to more books, movies, and fun times with friends and loved ones. Work is amazing, and it feels great to be at a company I really believe in, helping create a product I love using every day. I’m also staying on the board at Basic Rights, and I continue to be proud of our work in immigration rights, trans rights, and racial justice. So much of making this country a better place for everyone means small local changes, and I’m glad to be a small part of that work. I might try to compete more at powerlifting, and I definitely want to go back to Japan and Scandinavia if possible. The economy, at the time I’m writing this, looks like it’s headed towards a shit place, but I hope to keep saving money throughout the year. If everything works out, I’ll even get Snorri a new friend, so he doesn’t have to wait for me to get home from work alone every day. 2019 is another year—a fresh year to live and learn in. I’m looking forward to it.</p>

      <title>2018 iPad Pro Review</title>

      <content:encoded><p>Today my phone buzzed to tell me my new iPad had arrived at my office. I rushed down to the mailroom, and eagerly ripped open the packaging. For a few years I’ve used an iPad Pro 9.7” as my primary travel computer when I didn’t need to work on Kubernetes/DevOps stuff, and I’ve loved it. Whether I was watching shows on Netflix or Plex that I’d downloaded before a flight, editing my website in Working Copy, or just editing photos and browsing Twitter, this was the machine I wanted to use.</p>
<p>Now, I have 1.3” more screen, a more lap-capable keyboard, and 120hz refresh, and I couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/ipad.jpeg" alt="iPad"></p>
<h2 id="the-screen">The screen</h2>
<p>This iPad might not feel like as huge of a revelation to someone who used the 10.5”, but coming from the 9.7”, this screen feels luxurious. The smooth 120hz refresh rate means opening apps, and moving around looks amazing. The color and viewing angles are still the best in the tablet world, and make my even my MacBook feel like a relic of the past. It’s responsive, bright, and a joy to watch tv on.</p>
<h2 id="the-case">The case</h2>
<p>My iPad is the Space Grey color, and it looks excellent. The industrial lines of the sides are reminiscent of my favorite iPhone, the 4. Overall the iPad feels thin, and around the weight of my 9.7” even with the added screen size, and when I have it out of the keyboard folio, I don’t want to put it down. This tablet feels great in my hands. I seriously hope that Apple brings this design language to the next generation of iPhones, even though I wonder if they can while still keeping the glass back for wireless charging.</p>
<h2 id="the-keyboard-folio">The keyboard folio</h2>
<p>My main use of the iPad is with a keyboard attached, as I use it as a laptop mostly, which sometimes becomes a handheld tablet for reading. I’m still not convinced there needed to be two viewing angles, but the stiffness and lack of weird folding means it feels pretty great in my lap or on a desk. The tablet-mode keyboard against your fingers thing is slightly odd, but it also reminds me of playing the accordion, which I find funny enough to enjoy it. The keys feel nice and responsive, and largely the same as the 9.7” keyboard. If they changed the keys, I can’t tell. I do enjoy the slightly larger size that matches the bigger device, and my mistypes are few and far-between. Clicking the iPad into the folio feels fast and easy, even if it requires slightly more lining up than previously. With the folio closed, the iPad feel grippy, and like a thin notebook in the best way. The weight and feel, in my opinion, remind you that you’re holding a high quality device. The folio adds a little thickness, but I think it only brings the device to the previous size, so I haven’t felt like it was too thick.</p>
<h2 id="usb-c">USB-C</h2>
<p>It’s great. I love using the same charger for this iPad and my MacBook. I already invested in USB-C to lighting cables, so bringing this iPad and no USB spare battery for my iPhone sounds great. I haven’t tried plugging anything weird into the port, but folks at the Verge did their damndest to stump the port. <em>Spoiler</em> it doesn’t work with printers.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>It’s about the same as my old iPad, which is excellent.</p>
<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>
<p>There’s four of them. They’re loud, and clear. A+</p>
<h2 id="faceid">FaceID</h2>
<p>Just as quick and easy as my previous iPhone X, and possibly a little slower than the XS. I can’t quite tell, but I feel a little like I’m waiting now compared to using my phone. I haven’t timed it though, but generally it’s much better and easier than the TouchID.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>This is the iPad to get—whether you get the 12.9” or the 11”, especially if you haven’t upgraded in a few years. I seriously feel like this is the future of Apple computing, and iOS 13 is sure to bring more advanced features that mean I might not need a Mac outside of my office.</p>

      <title>A Review of Invasions</title>

      <description>It begins with a rip, the tearing sound of velcro—mix and match nipples kick off this delightfully strange collection of speculative fiction, trans body-horror, and water-logged zombies.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>It begins with a rip, the tearing sound of velcro—mix and match nipples kick off this <a href="http://www.instarbooks.com/books/invasions.html">delightfully strange collection</a> of speculative fiction, trans body-horror, and water-logged zombies. Calvin impressed me last year with his part in <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/a-review-of-meanwhile-elsewhere-166ec11bff7d">Meanwhile, Elsewhere</a>, revisited here as the excellent Rent, Don&rsquo;t Sell. This story explores a world in which bodies are traded for a time for fitness or fetish and how trans people deal with this faustian bargain. Another tale invites us to an isolated cabin for a wedding party that begins to fray at the edges in a blizzard. And, while every story isn&rsquo;t is a life-or-death one, but the weight of mortality permeates each page.</p>
<p>Whether the reader is wandering a bathhouse, stumbling through the streets, newly minted as a middle-aged-man, we are reminded each time that the world doesn&rsquo;t quite fit us. Invasions captures the feeling of being trans, even in innocuous settings. It&rsquo;s never Cronenberg, but regardless of how wild the twist, it&rsquo;s grounded and bodied in a way he couldn&rsquo;t imagine. Occasionally, a story follows an ostensibly cisgender person, to probe the space around a trans life, and to me these are the most speculative: &ldquo;What do they see in us? What do they think?&rdquo; To answer this question, one protagonist even employs a psychic talent to sift through memory and desire in those around him, even through their final moments.</p>
<p>This collection also challenges ideas around surgery, queer bodies, and perception. In Eternal Boy, we meet a queer person figuring out their gender, but at odds with their presentation as a boy; they&rsquo;re uncertain about the way women see them, but also willing to overlook those feelings for a chance to hook up. These characters are complicated; they&rsquo;re often anti-heroes, or even villains. We need more trans villains in a world of trans characters that are almost always a sob story or a heartwarming tale. I&rsquo;m here for the dirty, confused, angry, and alien.</p>
<p>One of closing stories is about a surgery center full of the wild variety of trans folks I&rsquo;ve met: from older late-transitioning women, to confident girls with their moms. Not content to let cis people be the only foil for trans protagonists, Calvin writes the interplay between intergenerational and intergender conflict and love wonderfully. On the heels of You Wouldn&rsquo;t Have Known is the more general body horror of pregnancy and a failure of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Invasions is one of the best collections I&rsquo;ve read in quite some time, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see Calvin&rsquo;s next book or collection. <a href="http://www.instarbooks.com/books/invasions.html">Pick up a copy today</a>. This writer is one to watch, and tell your friends about—a real trans-writers-writer. He delivered on the promise of his story in Meanwhile, Elsewhere with gusto, and blew this reader away.</p>

      <title>DSPTCH Waist Bag Review</title>
      <link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-04-dsptch-waist-bag/</link>

      <content:encoded><p>Recently, I ordered a <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/collections/packs/products/sling-pouch-medium">medium Sling Pack</a> after deciding I wanted a very small bag to bring with me to meetings or coffee shops where I only needed my iPad and a few other sundries. 11pm is not a great time to make <em>decisions</em>, so I clicked the order button before I checked measurements, and was sad when I realized it didn&rsquo;t actually fit my 9.7&quot; iPad. Luckily, I was already flying to San Francisco a week later, and was able to exchange it for the <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/products/waist-bag-black">Waist Bag</a>, after trying it on in the store. (An aside: the guy at DSPTCH was super nice, and really helpful, which further won me over. I think they have lots of great stuff, so even if this bag is too small for you, check it out.)</p>
<p>TL;DR this bag is fantastic for exactly what I bought it for—carrying an iPad and a few other things to meetings, or very short trips. A+ would buy again.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_front.jpeg" alt="Front"></p>
<h2 id="pockets-and-zips">Pockets and zips</h2>
<p>I <em>love</em> the way the pockets and zipper are laid out in this bag. The top of the bag is accessible via a single, incredibly tactile zipper pull. Seriously, this zipper pull is rad. Once unzipped, the main compartment is broken into two parts: one slightly padded iPad sleeve, and a slightly larger main area with a D-ring for keys. My 12&quot; MacBook <em>fits</em> in the main area, which WOW. Not much else fits in the main area if I put my laptop in here, but still, this is unbelievably cool. With an iPad, a Kindle Oasis, a rolled-up shirt, a pair of underwear, keys, and toiletries this compartment is pretty tightly packed, but the zipper is sufficiently robust (it&rsquo;s a big YKK), so I don&rsquo;t feel worried about it failing.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_main.jpeg" alt="Main"></p>
<p>The front of the bag is a flap with two super cool magnetic <a href="http://www.fidlock.com/en/fasteners/snap.html">Fidlock®</a> snaps. Pulling down slightly on each side reveals two slightly baggy pockets with elastic at the top. These pockets both have a vertical separation between the front and back of the pocket. I can fit a <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-13000-c/A1216011">USB-C battery pack</a> and cables, plus some headphones on one side, and a <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">Hobonichi Techo</a>, a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Charcoal-Black-Fine-Nib/pd/5075?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImKKypcvt3QIVhWB-Ch2pAQarEAQYAiABEgKbO_D_BwE">Lamy Safari</a>, and keycards, lip balm, and essential oil in the other. I&rsquo;ve also fit a Kindle Oasis in one of the pockets, but it was a tight fit, and I prefer keeping it in the main bag pocket. The ease of popping open the snaps after pulling the bag around to the front reminds me why I loved messenger bags back in the day. It&rsquo;s super cool. I love having all of my stuff easily-accessible, but I&rsquo;m also glad my load ends up light enough not to hurt my shoulder. More on that later.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_pockets.jpeg" alt="Pockets"></p>
<h2 id="material">Material</h2>
<p>The DSPTCH site says this bag is 1680D Ballistic Nylon with DWR coating, lined with 410D Nylon Packcloth with DWR coating. I haven&rsquo;t tested this bag in the rain yet, but the zip isn&rsquo;t seam-sealed, so while I&rsquo;d trust it in a light rain, I wouldn&rsquo;t swim with it. I bring a dry bag with me everywhere for toiletries though, and it&rsquo;s sufficiently large I could put the bag in it in a pinch, so I&rsquo;m not too worried. The material feels very nice, and high-quality, and the stitching and construction inspires confidence. The zipper pull is lightly textured on both sides, as well as contoured for a thumb and forefinger such that every use of it makes me smile.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_zip.jpeg" alt="Main"></p>
<p>This is a bag you will want to open and close. The Fidlock® snaps are similarly fun to use. The strap is pretty solid as well, and my only complaint is that I wish the clasp was metal/magnetic instead of plastic, even though the plastic feels solid. This bag generally feels like it will hold up for over 10 years, and Dpstch warranties it, which gives me even more confidence as I lug it around. I&rsquo;d be amiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention the &ldquo;high air flow back mesh for longer periods of wear,&rdquo; which means I don&rsquo;t end up with <em>as much</em> sweat on my back when I&rsquo;m walking around in over environments &gt;20˚.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_back.jpeg" alt="Back"></p>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>This is a <em>small</em> bag. You can wear it over the shoulder, as a cross body, either in front or on your back, or as a fanny-pack/waist bag as the name indicates. In inches, it measures at 8L, or 13&quot; x 9&quot; x 1.5&quot; at 1.1lbs, but the numbers belie how much it can carry. This is the kind of bag your friends say &ldquo;wow&rdquo; to as you slide out a 9.7&quot; iPad or 12&quot; MacBook. This bag fits really well on the floor under a seat on a plane without compromising foot space. It also feels great to walk in a crowd or get onto a crowded train knowing I won&rsquo;t bonk anyone with this bag, as it barely sticks out from my back. It&rsquo;s very easy to adjust the strap that goes around my chest as well, and it&rsquo;s easy to slide this bag around to the front when I need to pull something out. I&rsquo;ve occasionally worn this bag on my hip/butt as a fanny-pack, and while I think it looks a little silly, it&rsquo;s very comfortable—your mileage may vary on style/feel.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Overall, I love this bag, and look for every opportunity to bring it with me. In my effort to downsize and travel lightly, I&rsquo;ve found this to be a perfect companion. Every interaction I have with this bag feels great, and makes me smile. If you need something small to bring a few things to your next meeting, concert, or short trip, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/products/waist-bag-black">DSPTCH Waist Bag</a>. It&rsquo;s <em>seriously good</em> and my suspicion is the rest of their gear is equally great.</p>

      <title>Invisible One review</title>

      <description>Bags are my thing. Well, bags and shoes. Traveling as much as I do, having a dependable, comfortable, and sleek bag is pretty important.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Bags are my thing. Well, bags and shoes. Traveling as much as I do, having a dependable, comfortable, and sleek bag is pretty important. For the past two or so years, I&rsquo;ve depended on my Topo Designs Trip Pack for short trips, and then nested it inside of my Ryu QuickPack for longer trips abroad. This has worked out well, but walking around Copenhagen, and going through a variety of international airport security, I wondered if I could consolidate to one bag, with an easier way to access my laptop and other stuff. The <a href="https://www.opposethis.com/products/invisible-backpack-one-mini">Invisible One Mini</a> seemed like a great way to test this out. I was drawn to the design of the bag, and the ethos of the company: &ldquo;Each year we reiterate and improve our designs&hellip;&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve witnessed as I&rsquo;ve watched them iterate over the years.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/oneminifront.jpeg" alt="One Mini photo"></p>
<h2 id="pockets-and-zips">Pockets and zips</h2>
<p>My Topo Designs Trip Pack has three compartments—a main area where I can slip my laptop, a zip pouch in that main area, and a front pocket for a Kindle, notebook, etc. I found myself digging around more than I wanted to for my charger, pen, or chapstick. The Invisible One Mini has just a little more organization, and so far, it&rsquo;s made a huge difference.</p>
<p>The 2018 One Mini has a zipper pocket in the front, that&rsquo;s charmingly asymmetrical. A flap unzips, revealing a pocket that can hold an iPad or Kindle, a zipper-sealable area for keys, chapstick, glasses cloth, etc, and two smaller pouches. These pouches are the perfect size for a portable battery, and a Hobonichi Techo. There&rsquo;s a bit of additional space in the big zipper area for my MacBook charger as well. The entire big pouch is almost the width and heigh of the bag, but because of the clever organization, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ll lose things in it.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/oneminipocket.jpeg" alt="One Mini pocket"></p>
<p>On the top of the bag, there&rsquo;s a big zipper that opens the main compartment, which I use to hold a hoodie, my water bottle, and also a small bag of underwear and clothes for travel. Because of the front organization, I don&rsquo;t need to dig in this compartment often, and only need to keep a few easy-to-find or pack-to-leave unpack-at-destination items in it. This is a big improvement over the Topo Bag.</p>
<p>Finally, the back of the bag has a top-loading laptop sleeve that&rsquo;s soft and felt-lined. The bottom ends a bit above the bottom of the bag, providing a little cushion area, but I still wouldn&rsquo;t want to throw this bag around with my MacBook in it. Unlike the Ryu or the Topo Designs bags, this separate laptop area means I can dig my MacBook out on the occasions I can&rsquo;t get pre-check and have my laptop scanned separately. I try my damndest to avoid these instances, but inter-Europe travel usually means pulling out all my electronics.</p>
<p>Previous years of this bag had weird side zips on the front and back for the laptop, a water bottle, and documents and other stuff in the front, but this version feels more usable, and less confusing at a glance. I doubt I&rsquo;ll have any trouble remembering where I put various items, or how to quickly retrieve them. Read more about the year-over-year change <a href="https://www.opposethis.com/blogs/insidethis/invisible-backpack-one-2018">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-material">The material</h2>
<p>The entire bag is a light-weight 800x600D waterproof nylon-polyester blend that looks and feels pretty lux. The top handle is a rubber-ish leather-is material that&rsquo;s grippy and feels nice, and the inside of the pack straps is a soft and breathable cloth. The top of the bag is ringed with the same rubberized material, encircling the main compartment. The inside of the two front areas is a gray nylon that feels like smooth quality. All over the bag, the stitches are even and seem made for longevity. I&rsquo;ll update this review later to see how well the bag stood up to travel wear-and-tear, but so far it inspires confidence. I&rsquo;m also curious how well the rain resistance does, as only the laptop sleep area has a waterproof YKK zipper, with the other two using a more standard zip. The pulls have rubber grips, with no dangling pull cords, which means they&rsquo;re slightly more fiddly than the RYU or the Topo bags, but once I&rsquo;ve found the tab, the pull feels smooth.</p>
<h2 id="the-size">The size</h2>
<p>This is a small bag, but feels a good deal bigger than my tiny Topo Designs bag. Measuring 38cm x 34cm x 14cm (15&quot;x13.5&quot;x5.5&quot;), with a volume of 11L, and a weight of 650g (22oz), it&rsquo;s easy to throw on, but doesn&rsquo;t look dwarfed by my 5'10&quot; frame. It sits well on my back, and the clever straps let me cinch it up or down, while the excess strap stays tucked into itself. The main compartment is roomy enough without making the other areas of the bag feel cramped, that I feel pretty confident I could take only this bag for a few weeks abroad.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had this bag for long, but my first impressions are that this will be a major part of my travel kit. I can&rsquo;t wait to bring this with me to Oakland, or Japan, to see how well it fits under a seat, or loads and unloads in a crowded subway train.</p>
