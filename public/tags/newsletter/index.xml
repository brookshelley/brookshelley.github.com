<p><em>If you don&rsquo;t care about Cyberpunk 2077, skip to the links</em></p>
<p>After months of delay, and potentially transmisogynistic advertising, the <em>cyber witcher</em> is alive. I&rsquo;m playing Cyberpunk 2077, and so far, it&rsquo;s kinda fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent years wishing there was a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_Returns">Shadowrun game</a> that was an FPS, I think I finally have something essentially the same. I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s a bit more open-world than it currently is as I write this. I&rsquo;ll report back.</p>
<p>The year is <em>almost over</em> and that is a delight to me. I&rsquo;m taking the entire week of the 21st off from work, and that means I have a solid vacation from the 18th until the 3rd. Hurrah!</p>
<p>I hope you get a nice solitary break too, and lots of <em>eggs</em> if you&rsquo;re not vegan:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fill your head with links to pass that time~</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s set the mood with some music:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmSORFI2XzU" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<ul>
<li>My friend Lena <a href="https://www.tenpercent.com/meditationweeklyblog/good-snowflakes">sent this to me</a>, and it really helps with my mindset as we enter the 10th month of quarantining. If you&rsquo;ve never tried meditating, today is a good day to start. After all, you&rsquo;re probably reading this at home, and hopefully it&rsquo;s a bit quiet.</li>
<li>As an avowed fan of Russian literature, I deeply enjoyed this essay <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n21/patricia-lockwood/eat-butterflies-with-me">on Nabokov from Patricia Lockwood</a>. Firstly, pre-order <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/634158/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood/">her novel</a>. Secondly, Nabokov was very, very weird, but a great read. If you&rsquo;ve avoided him because of <em>Lolita</em> try Pnin or Pale Fire.</li>
<li>Spare 17 minutes to <a href="https://7ampodcast.com.au/episodes/yanis-varoufakis-on-making-billionaires-richer">listen to Yanis Varoufakis on how the current global economy seems hellbent on making billionaires richer to our detriment</a>. It&rsquo;s an appalling state of affairs, at least in this newsletter&rsquo;s opinion. One of the more frustrating aspects of this obvious pillaging of our planet is the rich' ability to convince everyone else that it&rsquo;s for their own good.</li>
<li>Do you miss <em>Flash</em>? I didn&rsquo;t much until I took a look at Archive.org&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/">flash archive project</a>. My old webcomic was completely created in Flash, so I&rsquo;ve considered trying to use this to bring it back.</li>
<li><strong>Newsletter recommendation</strong>! This one tackles some interesting topics, but I especially enjoyed this edition on <a href="https://genyeet.substack.com/p/america-pretends-it-does-not-see">the college scam</a>.</li>
<li>Need something to read over the holidays? Look no further than this <a href="https://kottke.org/20/12/the-best-books-of-2020">comprehensive list of book of the year lists</a>! My next few books are <em>all lined-up</em> with <em>Hammered</em> by Elizabeth Bear, and a re-read of <em>Infinite Jest</em> by David Foster Wallace currently on my nightstand. Even if you&rsquo;re not much of a reader, I highly recommend cracking something silly and fun open and <em>logging off</em> for a while. You might even enjoy it.</li>
</ul>

<p>2020 was a lot, but with only a few more weeks until 2021 in the US we&rsquo;re getting our first doses of a vaccine. From what I gather, it&rsquo;ll be months (likely until next fall), until we&rsquo;re in a state to get back to pre-pandemic habits, but it&rsquo;s nice to know we&rsquo;re at least moving in a direction. As I write this, the US is still grateful that the Supreme Court rejected a seditious case from the Texas AG to seize power for their awful figurehead, and I also hope we get to move past this as well.</p>
<p>My plan for 2021 is to keep this newsletter going for another year, and perhaps experiment a little with format. Thanks for reading so far through these 54+ editions, or however many you&rsquo;ve come along for. I&rsquo;ve loved writing these little linky missives to you each week, and it&rsquo;s made me feel a lot less alone knowing that somewhere out there a few of you are enjoying some weird shit I sent you.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and all your emails back! Stay safe, and keep loving each other, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Instead of writing this on Saturday, as I usually do, I drank a lot of nog + aquavit (nogavit) at a distance with my friend Lena, and then watched the show Big Mouth on Netflix.</description>

<p>We&rsquo;re starting another 3 weeks of full-lockdown thankfully, as cases skyrocket, and I am incredibly thankful. If folks take this three week period seriously we can make a dent. Please stay home. There&rsquo;s so much good tv!!</p>
<p>I will keep these links going during lockdown, and maybe they&rsquo;ll even get weirder? Anyways for now here&rsquo;s another set:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since it wrapped-up last week with a wonderful episode about risotto, I can heartily recommend you watch all of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5bvxj/how-to-with-john-wilson-hbo-nathan-fielder-2020">&lsquo;How to with John Wilson&rsquo;</a>. This show is in the vein of a the excellent &lsquo;Going Deep with David Reese&rsquo;, but is also a strangely gonzo B-roll show. Every episode goes to places previously unimagined, and I&rsquo;ve laughed-out-loud a bunch watching it.</li>
<li>Speaking of weird, one of my all-time favorite authors is particularly strange and I think his brand of bizarre storytelling fits this time where little makes sense. Please <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/17/the-ruined-map-secret-rendezvous-and-the-box-man-by-kobo-abe-review">read K≈çb≈ç Abe</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m fascinated by alternate modes of running software companies, so this <a href="https://www.org.meet.coop">video app coop is pretty interesting</a>. I doubt it will make serious headway against Zoom, but I do wish folks would seriously consider the implications of using a &ldquo;free&rdquo; tool to run their lives. Nothing is ever <em>really</em> free except for super neck-beard-y GNU stuff.</li>

<p>Sorry this is a little late, but thanks for reading. Have a chill Sunday, and think about the ways you can enjoy new New Years traditions that keep your mouth and air away from other humans.

<p>Greetings from the tail-end of a vacation week for your hostess. I celebrated my birthday on Thursday with a couple friends, a couple bottles of wine, 5lbs of mashed potatoes, and 6' of distance.</p>
<p>A strange year, but thus far 36 is a good one.</p>
<p>Friday saw those friends, save one who took care of Snorri, going on a long backpacking hike to camp near Cache Creek in -1C conditions. BRR!</p>

<p>Birthdays aren&rsquo;t my favorite thing, but this year it&rsquo;s nice I get to celebrate living another year instead of the holiday wherein the US celebrates our subjugation and theft of land from thousands of nations of indigenous folks.</p>
<p>Fuck Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I wish we celebrated other fall holidays instead, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice">solstice</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuseok">Ï∂îÏÑù</a> or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Thanksgiving_Day">Âã§Âä¥ÊÑüË¨ù„ÅÆÊó•</a>.

<p>Feel free to raise a glass to my birth if you&rsquo;d like to‚Äîno sacrifices or animal products required.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a birthday soundtrack for you:</p>

<p>My plan is to drink a little wine or something outside with a friend, quietly. Alameda county just instituted a 10pm curfew, which I am not sure will be effective in curbing COVID cases. It seems like the <a href="https://twitter.com/BillFOXLA/status/1328932610169561090?s=20">jerks who have indoor meals and gatherings</a> will continue to do so. I have a couple friends who are seeing their families during Thanksgiving, but they&rsquo;ve been quarantining and will do so again afterwards.</p>
<p>I hope this can get better sooner than later, tbh.</p>
<p>Hope you&rsquo;re staying safe!</p>

<li>Are your parents boomers? Have you wondered what the Internet might be like for them? <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/internet-baby-boomers-misinformation-social-media_n_5f998039c5b6a4a2dc813d3d">Wonder no more</a>. The short version is they see a vastly different internet than most of us, with a strong and upsetting trend towards right-wing misinformation from all sorts of shitlords. Instead of keeping the previous generation from installing spyware and malware from email links, it is now a responsibility of their kids to keep them from fully joining the death cult.</li>
<li>I got my new M1 Mac this week, and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition">so, so fast.</a> I wrote a bit about it on <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/apple-season/">my site</a>, but the short version is it does everything my old computer does faster, and with a significantly lower power requirement. Because of the redesign of Rosetta to be a translation layer, things even run faster through it too. I get the sense there will be a few months between now and when all apps are updated for Apple Silicon, but something like 90% of what I use is already there.</li>
<li>Do you feel a little lost in the surreality of the modern internet? <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">Here&rsquo;s a travel guide</a>. We&rsquo;ve come a long way since BBS and alt.mac communities, and I&rsquo;m curious to see if we move back into a world more focused on small private communities instead.</li>

<li>Pour one out for a <a href="https://www.needsupply.com">website that was too expensive</a>, but I still browsed through occasionally in fits of capitalist pique.</li>
<li>We may not be able to travel right now, but we can go back in time a little and <a href="https://wimwendersstiftung.de/en/film/tokyo-ga-2/">view Tokyo through one man&rsquo;s camera</a>. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see how little parts of Japan have changed since the 80s.</li>

<p>Love yourself and your friends.</p>
<p>Get real, real cozy.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm talking wool and nog. Candles and cats. Fireplaces, trees, baking a pie. This is truly the best season or hunker down and stay safe. I want to see all of your shining faces next summer.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of Saturday talking with my friend Lena on a hike about getting older and learning to appreciate who we are at our core. Her friendship continues to be such a boon. I hope you have a close pal you can just be yourself with over the phone, on a walk, or even as a partner.</p>
<p>Make something this week that smells amazing, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Can you believe we‚Äôre halfway through November? Despite the sameness of many days during this mostly-constant quarantine, this year is somehow flying by. For a lot of my friends, this week was a big one for a tiny iPhone Mini, or a giant PS5. I got the big, big Sony machine in the mail on Friday, and immediately dove back into the updated No Man‚Äôs Sky; flying around procedurally generated planets in my purple spaceship never looked so good.</p>
<p>Our election is thankfully over in the states, and Biden won. Do you think we‚Äôll get to see Tenet in our homes before the shit in charge gives in and admits it? Tenet comes out on December 15th supposedly, so place your bets.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs some music for this clown car of a year:</p>

<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs a real bummer that when the pandemic is finally over, so many neighborhood restaurants and stores will be closed. In Japan, ramen shops are boarding up instead of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-11/tokyo-s-tiny-noodle-bars-close-up-shop-rather-than-raise-prices">gouging their customers</a> to stay in business. I don‚Äôt know about you, but that kind of attitude is exactly. what I want to see more in the world. More affordable ramen for the every person. Also the chart in this article on the price of ramen helped me understand just how long these delicious noodles have been inexpensive. Êò≠Âíå prices in a ‰ª§Âíå world.</li>
<li>On Saturday I rewatched Akira and started Serial Experiments Lain all over again. There‚Äôs something to be said for these two very strange and beautiful anime about self-actualization and nirvana.</li>

<ul>
<li>I grew up in fairly run-of-the-mill evangelical sect that fully believed in the end of the world and the eventual second-coming. It <em>turns-out</em> the things I learned in the backwoods might <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/09/what-i-learned-from-preparing-for-the-end-of-the-world">serve me well now still</a>. If nothing else, I can do a lot of weird outdoorsy things that you wouldn‚Äôt expect. Also I‚Äôve shot some truly wild guns.</li>
<li>Continuing the mild bummer, I really enjoy Anne Helen Peterson‚Äôs newsletter, and this last week‚Äôs was all about the <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/other-countries-have-social-safety">‚Äúsocial safety net‚Äù that women provide in the states</a>. We seriously won‚Äôt be able to advance gender justice and equity until we also deal with the massive lack of living wages and healthcare.</li>
<li>How do I keep track of these links? <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>! Every time I find something cool, I paste it into Things in a project called Weekly Links. Other folks I know swear by <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a> which is specifically a bookmark manager, but I like having all my links in my task list, so that when I tap ‚Äúwrite newsletter‚Äù I get directed to the part of the app with links, plus the Drafts section of iAWriter with cool URLs like: <code>ia-writer://open?path=Drafts</code>
<code>things:///show?id=123-456-789</code></li>
<li>In case you don‚Äôt like digital todo apps, perhaps you‚Äôd enjoy <a href="https://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/today-soon">these cards</a>?</li>

<p>Please don‚Äôt go to a large gathering for the holidays! Virus cases are on the rise, and I‚Äôd love to know that my readers are taking it easy and keeping themselves and their family safe! Thanksgiving is my birthday this year, but I plan to stay home, and at most drink outside with two or three people at a distance. It‚Äôs just not worth it to do more.</p>
<p>OK. PSA over.</p>
<p>Is there anything you‚Äôre really looking forward to during the colder months? What‚Äôs your favorite cozy item or way to make the most of these long, crisp, beautiful nights? Any scents or flavors you associate with fall and winter? Personally, I love glogg and risgryngot while it‚Äôs cold. Nothing like mulled wine and some rice pudding to really liven-up the season. Also don‚Äôt forget about hot pot and salted fishes. However you enjoy your fall, I look forward to <a href="mailto:newsletter@brookshelley.com">hearing about it</a>, and testing-out other folks‚Äô hygge traditions.</p>

<p>I hope you get to celebrate too.</p>

</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs get to those links.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why is it that some cities feel fun to walk around, and in others it can feel like an endless slog to walk to the convenience store down the block? <a href="http://www.originalgreen.org/blog/2012/walk-appeal.html">Walk appeal</a>.</li>
<li>Have you ever considered juggling&hellip; for a small creature?</li>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<ul>
<li>Now I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I‚Äôm no economics genius, but <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2020/9/10/degrowth-and-mmt-a-thought-experiment">this seems pretty clever</a>.</li>
<li>Can you feel the colder weather? Do you feel like getting cozy? Maybe this <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/takibi-blanket">blanket</a> and these <a href="https://huckberry.com/store/greys/category/p/60830-the-outdoor-slipper-boot">slippers</a> will help. Personally I‚Äôm a big wool blanket fan, and wool slipper boots are part of my every day wear at home. Why not be comfy all the time?</li>
<li>If you think tech is boring skip this one, but I thought it was an interesting look at how <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/reviews/pixel-5-vs-iphone-12-which-camera-phone-shoots-better-night-photos">two camera systems</a> have changed when it comes to night photos. I‚Äôm super curious to see how much of a difference the new iPhone 12 Pro Max‚Äô camera makes in quality of photos particularly.</li>
<li>When you‚Äôre done partying and celebrating a victory that <em>wasn‚Äôt even close</em>, you might need to wash some of those party clothes. Why is it that <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21523419/laundry-hate-chore-washing-machine">laundry is <em>still</em> such a chore</a>?! At my apartment, I have to take my basket 300m or so around a corner and through a couple doors, where inevitably someone will have finished laundry just sitting in the machine. COVID has made this trickier for sure. What if we all just went back to wearing stinky fur and leather? If we collectively lower our standards we can save a lot of time for watching tv.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>I am thinking a lot about leadership lately. What does it mean to be a good leader? A thoughtful one? A caring and supportive mentor? I‚Äôm a manager as of last week, and I aim to take it very seriously, while taking myself less so. If you have any tips, or books you‚Äôve read (Lara Hogan and Camille Fourier are both on my shelf) <a href="mailto:newlsetter@brookshelley.com">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also thinking about how I want my state and country to be led. I want the people who are most ill-served by our government to have their voices heard, and to see themselves in the electorate. More black leaders, queer leaders, indigenous leaders, and a smorgasbord of genders. The demographics of the <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/election-demographics-race-trump-clinton/Content?oid=24192623">country are changing, and the elected should figure that out</a>. How do we elect another dozen socialist and environmentally-minded senators? How do we make sure that even in ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù cities that anti-worker legislation like Prop 22 doesn‚Äôt pass?</p>
<p>When our celebrations and hangovers are over, I know y‚Äôall will be all over that question.</p>
<p>For now, enjoy your weekend, congrats on the win, and let‚Äôs make sure 2021 looks better.</p>

I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I am <em>sitting pretty</em>, but fortunately the amount in my bank account means when I support non profits and friends that support is a significant portion of my finances.

<p>Phew, that was a lot of links! The colder weather has me amped and full of excitement, not to mention Monday being the first day of my new job as Ms. Manager. Can you believe someone is paying me to care about, support, and listen to four amazing engineers? Go figure!</p>
<p>The days are way shorter now, which means it‚Äôs a good time to light some candles and just really relax through the end of 2020. This week promises to be high-stress for all of us, but I‚Äôll be sure to put in some fun links next week regardless. The early voting in Texas is very exciting, and I‚Äôm so, so happy to see so many friends and loved-ones get involved in GOTV and voter protection work.

</div>

<p>Ok, wipe the tears of joy/anger/surprise off your face, and let‚Äôs <em>get to those sweet, sweet links</em>.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Superconductors are pretty wild, and <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-first-room-temperature-superconductor-20201014/">this room-temperature one</a> is even wilder! There‚Äôs only one minor catch‚Äîyou have to crush the material using diamonds. Looking forward to a future where there‚Äôs tiny incredibly pressurized diamond vises inside my phone. That‚Äôs how physics work, right?</li>
<li>Some cool new research on choice suggests that <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/10/02/babies-prefer-what-they-choose-even-when-random/">our choices influence our preferences</a> by virtue of choosing. So much of how human behavior shakes-out ends up being way, way less smart and free than I‚Äôd like to think of myself. We‚Äôre just weird, wet meat sacks full of chemical and bacterial influence. Go figure.</li>
<li>Have you read or heard about the absolute fuckery of Foxconn in Wisconsin? Here‚Äôs a story of how corruption, greed, and just a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump">big old grift fucked-over an entire state</a>. The level of research and the amount of time spent checking in on the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù of these factories is wild! This week‚Äôs Vergecast had an interview with the writer as well, and apparently he just hung out in Wisconsin for four entire months. That‚Äôs dedication.</li>
<li>If you‚Äôre like me, you might need a drink after those links! Celebrate with some <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammel_Dansk">Gammel Dansk</a> (old danish). I love this bitter dram whether with snacks or on the rocks. I was introduced to it during a really amazing meal that Mae in Portland did with a now defunct Portland Scandinavian restaurant. I think this liquor was the alcohol pairing for course 10 out of 11, right before we had some coffee to wake us up. I can‚Äôt remember what food it was paired with, just that I loved this stuff. It‚Äôs hard to find, but if you can get some, be sure to. I think my pal Brian brought me some from Denmark.</li>
<li>Ever find yourself driving around wondering ‚Äúhey what happens if someone shoots an RPG at me?!‚Äù Well, here‚Äôs the <a href="https://twitter.com/JonHawkes275/status/1302874438149570560?s=20">trick to beat those little buggers</a>. I love how this armor is almost like a chain-length fence for misses. Low-tech the best answer sometimes.</li>
<li>Instead of going to war though, what if we fed our neighbors, and <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/a-restaurant-for-a-chipmunk">enjoyed their snacks vicariously</a>. I love small woodland creatures, and the idea of them sitting at a small picnic table brings me a large amount of joy.</li>
<li>Finally, I‚Äôll leave you with a really neat piece on an amazing musician named <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/19/adrianne-lenkers-radical-honesty">Adrianne Lenker</a> (you might know her from Big Thief). She just released <a href="https://www.adriannelenker.com">two albums</a> that are pretty damn good. Seriously, check her out if you need some jams</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>This week was finally a bit chilly, which makes me deeply excited for the coming Winter. Just imagine, a brisk morning with a warm cup of coffee! Candles! Festive hats! Decorative gourds! <a href="https://www.saltedtv.com/recipes/uunipuuro-finnish-porridge-by-daniel-oseas">Finnish rice porridge</a>. Warm up those mulling spices, and let‚Äôs get excited.</p>
<p>Have you seen any fun, spooky films? What are your favorite fall traditions? <a href="mailto:newsletter@brookshelley.com">Let me know</a> &lt;3</p>
<p>Also, you‚Äôve voted, right? Against prop 22 and for Biden? Good. Thanks! We‚Äôve got one more of these newsletters before a very tense week, and I want you to know I‚Äôm also fully clenched, waiting. We‚Äôll get through this! Keep loving, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

<p>Her arrival will be heralded by the sounds of trumpets.</p>
<p>Are you decorating this year? Are you going to dress up? Are you planning to use a Halloween candy chute, or shoot children with jelly-filled paintballs? The spookiest thing to me is still <em>asymptomatic super-spreaders</em>. I don‚Äôt think that would make a very good horror film, but outside of Vampires vs. the Bronx and the Haunting of Bly Manor, I haven‚Äôt felt much desire to watch one of those. I <em>am</em> due for a rewatch of <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/over-the-garden-wall-7955110c-56cb-45b1-9eae-68550344128b">Over the Garden Wall</a> though.</p>

<li>It really rules to see <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sohla-el-waylly-profile.html">someone so talented thriving</a> despite the racism and inequality of her former workplace. This profile of Sohla El-Waylly was a great read, and I can‚Äôt wait to see all her new videos.</li>

<p>I have too many clams. This is a weird problem to have, but my most recent order from <a href="https://www.seaforager.com">my fishmonger</a> contained what seems like hundreds of the little shelled suckers, and despite enjoying clams, I have no way to share them. May we all be blessed with such issues of bounty.</p>
<p>I hope you‚Äôve voted! We got our mail-in/drop-off ballots last week, and there are a <em>lot</em> of propositions in California. I found <a href="https://progressivevotersguide.com">this guide</a> very helpful, and you might as well if you‚Äôre still not sure what dots to fill in.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs almost November, and since this is a special small group, I‚Äôm happy to announce I‚Äôm starting my new gig as Ms. Manager at my company on the 2nd. The team I‚Äôll manage is such a kind and smart crew that I‚Äôm super lucky to hang out with. I can‚Äôt wait!

<p>We‚Äôre only a few days away from what could be a pretty exciting Apple event! If you‚Äôve waited for a while to get a new phone, or really want something smaller, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-12-top-features/">you might just be in luck</a>. Whether the rumors amount to anything, Apple is definitely launching something on Tuesday. I‚Äôll be tuning in.</p>
<p>More than the phone even, I‚Äôm excited to see if they actually ship a computer with their own silicon. It seems like the main feature will be performance, with a side of excellent battery life. I can‚Äôt wait.</p>
<p>Other than tech shit, this week was nice and chill. The smoke outside continues to plague my bike rides, and the plague is a constant worry, but those are almost background pain at this point.</p>
<p>I hope you‚Äôre taking it easy as well, and that you have a neighbor who gives you bonus fruits from their trees! Thanks Haley for the amazing passion fruit!</p>
<p>This week should be good, so let‚Äôs get to it:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs always good to start off your Sunday with a little bit of dancing:</li>

<li>But remember, while you dance (outside) be sure to wear a <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/tom-bihn-v3-three-layer-cloth-face-mask/">good mask</a> and stay well-away from your fellow Ewoks.</li>
<li>I just learned that my way too brilliant coworker Bert <a href="https://bert.org/2020/10/01/pressing-yubikeys/">made a finger to tap his Yubikey</a>. This is just the kind of disturbingly smart shit I love. I‚Äôm reminded of my friend Mark‚Äôs somewhat abandoned project to make a ‚Äúcloud finger‚Äù that would open the garage door to our office a few years ago. Why touch things with your meat fingers, when you can make a single-use robot?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/qiui-smart-chastity-sex-toy-security-flaw/">This</a> gives platform lock-in a whole new meaning. The real dominatrix was insecure APIs the whole time.</li>

Instead of cursing us with no way to securely communicate, what if those legislators worked on houselessness and ending the wars they started in the global south?</li>

I get this sense <a href="https://www.halloweencostumes.com/mens-tiger-king-trainer-costume.html">this one</a> will be popular, even though Tiger King feels like it came out two-thousand years ago.</p>
<p>My friend Laura has a <a href="https://tinyletter.com/31daysofhalloween">way spookier newslettter</a> that she only runs during October but is a daily treat this month. I hope you read it too.</p>
<p>So far <em>deathwatch</em> 2020 hasn‚Äôt offered anybody any big winnings, but I know many stay hopeful. The fly this week reminded us that these men are actual pieces of shit.</p>
<p>If you feel up for getting involved a bit and supporting trans rights, <a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/events/spark-sponsors">this event</a> next week should be good.

      <content:encoded><p>October is full of surprises and delights so far. I feel like so many of us have held our collective breath, waiting for folks who so flagrantly flaunt the recommendations of doctors and scientists to reap what they‚Äôve sown. The reaping began on Thursday night.</p>
<p>After the low of the debate this week, which I ended-up watching after swearing I wouldn‚Äôt, Thursday was a breath of fresh air. The news is coming fast and very obscured by a fog of misinformation and lies, but I am reloading pretty constantly. I hope we figure out what the actual timeline of events was eventually.</p>
<p>But, you don‚Äôt read this newsletter for schadenfreude, right? Let‚Äôs get to those juicy, juicy links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôll start with a very long read on the potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry">end of tourism as an industry</a>. It‚Äôs pretty clear that nonstop cruise ships and careless gawkers are tearing apart cities and the natural environment, so it‚Äôll be curious to see if any of that recovers from the COVID-19 shutdown. I think it‚Äôs super important for folks to travel to other countries with an open mind, but that seems pretty counter to traveling with a ship full of people just like you.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm pretty excited about this upcoming executive directed Nathan Fielder show:</li>

<ul>
<li>Also I wish this were true:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don‚Äôt want to be alarmist, but my sources inside Walter Reed are telling me that Trump has been having diarrhea for 13 hours straight. ‚ÄúThe entire bed is saturated.

<ul>
<li>Have you watched Pen15 yet? If not, I highly recommend giving it a go. Not only is it a hilarious and brutally real portrayal of the time period I grew up in, but it‚Äôs even a great portrayal of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/pen15-gabe-gay-storyline">growing up gay</a>. There is a fair amount of second-hand embarrassment, but even if that‚Äôs not your thing, I hope you give it a go. I can‚Äôt wait for part two of season two!</li>
<li>Here‚Äôs a great read on <a href="https://www.theconsciouskid.org/white-fragility/">white fragility</a>, the all-to-easy to fall into condition for my fellow white folks. I think it‚Äôs pretty important to remember that our discomfort pales in comparison to the real threats and pain felt by folks of color around us. This same ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurt that you‚Äôre hurt‚Äù bullshit extends to queerness and transness as well. Learning and growing is painful, but it‚Äôs worth it.</li>
<li>These are by far the worst sexts I‚Äôve ever read:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also the sexts in question are just... what? <a href="https://t.co/zTyuRwkJ2w">https://t.co/zTyuRwkJ2w</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCisiKqVdi">pic.twitter.com/cCisiKqVdi</a></p>&mdash; Suzannah Claire Perry (@sclaire_perry) <a href="https://twitter.com/sclaire_perry/status/1312235858981015552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I love this piece on <a href="https://readymag.com/readymag/readme/define_and_conquer/">online writing</a>, though I guess it‚Äôs also an advert for the CMS it‚Äôs created in. There‚Äôs a real The Outline vibe to this, but I found some good tips on typography and spacing amidst all the wackiness. I‚Äôve finally gotten <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">my site</a> into good shape, but every time I read something like this, I start to inch towards my sass file all over again.</li>
<li>Wow, it‚Äôs time to order <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">next year‚Äôs Hobonichi Techo</a>. I‚Äôve used one of those diary/journals for the past 3 years, and I dearly love it. There‚Äôs a satisfaction to writing down my thoughts and the day‚Äôs events on paper. This journal pairs nicely with a <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-safari/">good fountain pen</a> because of the high-quality thin paper that doesn‚Äôt bleed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>With a month that is so full of wild news, I hope you‚Äôre able to take some time to breath and go on a nice ride or walk to clear your head. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and Snorri and I are also hiding out, and staying hunkered-down until we have a vaccine. Stay safe, satay healthy, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Everybody watch out, I own a laser now. Far from being a futuristic laser pistol, it‚Äôs a much more banal home hair removal laser. As a trans lady, the ‚Äòol hormones left me with some annoying dark facial hair that I‚Äôve mostly blasted off, but in quarantine time I‚Äôve been unable to finish my treatment. So, if you hear some yowls coming from emeryville, that‚Äôs just me.</p>
<p>This weekend is also a great breadmaking weekend here. I‚Äôve really figured out my bread recipe after months, and this is looking awesome.</p>
<p>Finally, it‚Äôs also time for the Formula 1 race in RussiaÔøº, which hopefully will lead to a more interesting championship fight. I‚Äôm still excited for Lewis to clinch more lifetime records, as he clearly deserves all of them. However, I‚Äôm also excited to see some up-and-coming racers really making a name for themselves. I hope in the near future though we see more women and people of color in racing generally.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs get on with&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you love design research? Then <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordion-icons/">you‚Äôre in luck</a>! Apparently it‚Äôs all about the caret and not the hamburger icon for accordions. Who knew!</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdWn7PCDqNUQvzmPaJPMEYqsXKAVcuE0MPxcJVdaKjw/edit#">This document</a> is a really awesome, and super worrying survey of the climate crisis we‚Äôre facing. I still believe somehow we will convince humanity to change tack and save our place on this planet, but it‚Äôs going to be rough.</li>
<li>Remember when <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/09/rich-famous-onlyfans-changing-sex-workers-left-behind-bella-thorne-caroline-calloway-beyonce">OnlyFans was just for cool sex workers</a> and real, real horny content? It turns out ex-Disney stars and other random celebrities have invited and rather ruined it for the rad folks who were making money on it before. Bummer. Listen, if you‚Äôre an influencer, stick to Instagram. Fuck off everyone who is like ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll just sell my nudes‚Äù as like a fun hobby‚Äîit‚Äôs a real job, and it‚Äôs real hard.</li>
<li>Second New Statesman link this week, but <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon">this one</a> is about a rad new book site called Storygraph. I‚Äôve played around with it for a while this week, and it‚Äôs so much better than Goodreads, especially since it isn‚Äôt beige or owned by Amazon.</li>
<li>Have you ever been interviewed by someone with a real shitty agenda? <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times">Judith Butler teaches a masterclass</a> in this interview on how to parry and riposte just such a poor interview. I remember a lot of things Butler wrote being used against trans women in the early 2000s, but it‚Äôs really nice to see them come back to restate and clarify their support of trans women and other trans folks.</li>
<li>Free is <em>rarely</em> free, and if you aren‚Äôt paying for your hosting or web software, you‚Äôre often the <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites">product they‚Äôre really selling</a>. I‚Äôd encourage you to think long and hard about supporting cool companies like <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">Fastmail</a>, or even just using and contributing to excellent open-source projects like Hugo. This newsletter is sent via <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a>, for instance, because it‚Äôs well-made, and seems to take privacy and quality seriously instead of focusing on up-and-to-the-right growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems like we‚Äôre going to deal with COVID for another year at best, which is pretty frustrating. I hope you‚Äôre registered to vote, and are involved in local politics as well. We need better leadership, an more representation from folks of color, women, queers, and younger people. It‚Äôs super obvious that a country run by rich white people in their 70s is just going to such, so I hope we can pushing for something better.</p>
<p>I definitely have had a hard time with so much of the news and the utter lack of justice for black folks murdered by police, especially Breonna Taylor. This can‚Äôt continue.</p>
<p>I am in this with you, and I care. Let‚Äôs keep fighting together as long as we can. Keep safe, keep resisting, and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Finally, a brief respite in the smoke! I got to go on a nice long bike ride around the lake as soon as the air hit green. The rest of the week could‚Äôve been spent outside, but I mostly just worked-out and play video games. Oh well.</p>
<p>The news of RBG‚Äôs death last night made me pretty sad, but also reminded me that a future that‚Äôs better than any past we‚Äôve had depends on each and every one of us resisting and working towards it. It‚Äôs very helpful when folks dedicate their lives towards causes, but if everyone puts in like 10% effort we‚Äôd be in a better place, I think. So, VOTE. Donate. I‚Äôm on the host committee this year for the Trans Law Center‚Äôs gala, so it would be dope if you <a href="https://app.mobilecause.com/e/YB54-Q?vid=br1bq">attended or threw in some cash</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I‚Äôm playing lots of Dark Souls (yes, the first one), and cooking, and trying to learn how to mop effectively. It turns out after 35 years of life, I might actually be someone who cleans regularly. I still miss being able to hire a housekeeper though.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs get on with the links!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ann Helen Petersen, recently of the Burnout article that went around wrote about <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/your-surge-capacity-is-depleted-it-s-why-you-feel-awful-de285d542f4c">surge capacity</a>. We‚Äôve all been operating in bursts since March 2020, in addition to the nexus of challenges and pains that we‚Äôre dealing with normally.</li>
<li>Have you heard how everyone is <em>fleeing the cities</em> for the suburbs? It <em>turns out</em> that <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/8/31/21404333/suburbs-housing-boom-urban-exodus-coronavirus">just isn‚Äôt true</a>. There‚Äôs so much fearmongering these days, but despite rents falling a bit in cities like San Francisco, folks‚Äô reasons for staying in the cities are the same as their reasons for moving there in the first place. For me at least, moving somewhere without queer or trans rights just <em>isn‚Äôt an option</em>.</li>

<li>I dove back into the sand world of Dune recently, and as a long time fan of the first book and the Lynch film, I am glad to be sorta-kinda <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/5333/dune-revival-2018-david-lynch">in the ‚ÄúDune fandom‚Äù</a>.

<li>This remains <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/5495/how-to-beat-linked-in-the-game">one of the funniest things I‚Äôve read in a while</a>. Joe is a great writer, and a good friend. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever endorsed me for anything on LinkedIn, but if I knew how to endorse people, I would endorse him for ‚Äúhumorous content‚Äù, and ‚Äúlooks good in a Miata‚Äù.</li>
<li>Speaking of Joe, he texted me a <a href="https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram">very good link</a> the other night, and it had me dead from laughter. The rollercoaster of this ‚Äúhack‚Äù and the eventual conclusion is a delight throughout. Good job MangoPDF. Good job.</li>
<li>Finally, let‚Äôs talk about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190206-what-the-meat-paradox-reveals-about-moral-decision-making"><em>eating meat</em></a>. Yea, that‚Äôs right, putting dead animal parts into our mouth holes. It‚Äôs weird, but also totally normal. It <em>turns out</em> most of us don‚Äôt like to consider how those animal parts get into our mouth holes from fields and trees. I eat a very plant-heavy diet these days, and try to consume only animals I would or have killed. I can‚Äôt say you have to live your life this way by any means, but I <em>do</em> think it‚Äôs worth considering the impact your diet has on the world and on specific animals.</li>

<p>The best time to start meditating is yesterday, and the second best time is today, to paraphrase something half-remembered. If you can take some time to just breathe, it‚Äôs a neat, free way to feel just a little bit better. If you have a little bit more money and time, therapy is also excellent. We‚Äôll be in this kinda shit for a while to come, it seems like, and I know I‚Äôve benefited from support and these two practices.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of the links this week made you laugh a bit, because laughter is dope. I hope wherever you‚Äôre reading this from you‚Äôve got a nice day ahead of you. Stay safe, keep fighting, and I‚Äôll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Greetings from the surface of Mars! Wednesday in the Bay Area was deeply scary and awful, but the smoke has stayed here albeit in a lower-to-the-ground fashion all week. I haven‚Äôt really been outside since two Wednesdays ago, and I hate it.</p>
<p>Keep folks in Oregon in your thoughts too, because their air quality is even worse than ours, and friends around Portland are preparing to potentially evacuate. It‚Äôs a scary time!</p>
<p>I know you don‚Äôt come here for sad news, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got to lead with today, sorry!</p>
<p>In positive news, it‚Äôs the Tuscan GP weekend in F1, and the track is super fast and wild. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a big passing track, but qualifying was super close. Also Monday is a fairly interesting conversation for your host, me, so light a candle or something for that. More news to come, hopefully.</p>
<p>For now though, let‚Äôs <em>link it up</em>.</p>

<li>File this under ‚Äúhilariously silly,‚Äù but supposedly satanists are handing out <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4394932/illuminati-satanists-are-handing-out-of-cursed-rosary-beads-to-unsuspecting-catholics-leaving-them-haunted-by-evil-spirits-warns-chief-exorcist/">‚Äúcursed‚Äù rosary beads</a> to unsuspecting Catholics. Hail Satan! While I‚Äôm not sure that curses actually work, I‚Äôm all the way here for cursing people. Placebos <em>are</em> effective, so perhaps placebo curses are also effective? Let‚Äôs curse the bastards.</li>
<li>Speaking of curses, are you cursed with specialist knowledge you can‚Äôt communicate? Steven Pinker has <a href="https://fs.blog/2016/03/stephen-pinker-tells-us-why-our-professional-writing-sucks-and-what-to-do/">some tips</a>! This was a pretty interesting read on how to write for you audience, instead of your coworkers when writing technically. I personally loathe super-jargon-y writing, of which there is a ton in tech. So, I hope you absorb this for anything you write, and aim towards digestible, interesting writing.</li>
<li>This last week, for no apparent reason I started rewatching all the Mission Impossible films from the beginning. I find Tom Cruise pretending to be deeply straight quite amusing, and was convinced by my pal Drew that watching him run is also a delight. I think the 4th movie is my favorite so far, but hilariously I found out that MI3 was <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/mission-impossible-3-on-nokia-n93-3549677.html">released on the Nokia N93</a> which is featured in the film. I‚Äôm all about stupid merchandising tie-ins, and this one is perfect. Imagine watching Tom Cruise run around on a 2.4‚Äô <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n93-1551.php">240x320px screen</a>. This was a time period where I was importing Nokia phones from Asia and Europe to use myself, so I definitely wanted this absurd phone for myself. I wonder <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nokia-N-Series-N93-Silver-Unlocked-Smartphone/143623148929?hash=item21709b5581:g:zTAAAOSwPpZaIEbg">if EBay has one with MI3 loaded?</a></li>
<li>This week, I was also thinking about how Q Anon is just an updated version of anti-Semitic blood libel bullshit. Turns out, <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/72339/qanon-is-a-nazi-cult-rebranded/">I wasn‚Äôt the only one</a>. I find this stuff seriously disturbing, in addition to being utterly absurd. I genuinely wish people would find a way to disown Zionist crap, and embrace Jewish people and perhaps even the Jewish faith.</li>
<li>This week marked the 19th anniversary of 9/11, and <a href="https://www.opednews.com/articles/American-Muslims-19-years-by-Abdus-Sattar-Ghaza-Activist_Alliances_American-Muslim-Voice_Anti-Muslim-200911-172.html">anti-Muslim sentiment is still a huge problem</a>. My Muslim friends have described the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/was-there-really-a-post-9-11-backlash-against-muslims/256725/">abuse</a> and <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-12/data-hate-crimes-against-muslims-increased-after-911">hatred</a> they felt in the ensuing 19 years, and It makes me sick. No one should be persecuted or hated for their faith or culture. Learn about Islam, and care for the Muslim folks around you. Stand up to the bullies and bigots, because our planet is too small to be a narrow-minded asshole.</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs learn to <a href="https://blog.longnow.org/02020/07/20/six-ways-to-think-long-term-a-cognitive-toolkit-for-good-ancestors/">think long-term</a>. This planet will outlast the human race, possibly, but most certainly a struggle and hope for rights and a better world will outlast those of us reading this in 2020. It‚Äôs a great idea to <a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/building-a-peace-narrative/">think of a peace narrative</a>, and commit to efforts that will last for generations. I personally find a great deal of solace in being part of a multi-generational effort to win rights and support for LGBTQIA folks around the world. Find your cause, be it environmental, or social, or both, and get involved. The planet will appreciate it, as will many generations to come.</li>
<li>To finish out this week, let‚Äôs consider how wild it is that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/790609.stm">so many people die on stairs</a>. There are <em>way</em> more deaths on stairs than due to shark attacks, but a movie about falling down the stairs would be pretty boring. Unless&hellip; what if the stairs were <em>haunted</em>? Spooky, killer stairs. I dunno. Just spitballing here.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs have a better week than last week! Reach out to a friend or two you haven‚Äôt talked to in a while, and say hi. Tell them you care, and you‚Äôre thinking of them. We‚Äôll get through this present series of crisis, and I personally think part of doing so is deepening the community we‚Äôve built. Hug a friend (safely), pet, or partner and think of the things in your life you‚Äôre grateful for and the things you love.</p>
<p>Silly, or poignant, there are so many amazing works of art and media in the world. Are you reading or watching anything fun? <a href="mailto:hello@brookshelley.com">Let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Also, happy Apple announcement week to those of you who eagerly anticipate spending money at the altar of Apple, Inc. It should be a wild ride.</p>
<p>This week‚Äôs email was a bit all over the place for me emotionally, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at, so sorry/not-sorry. As always though, take care, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Welcome to my delayed last newsletter of the month. I had some pals by yesterday to sit at a distance in my courtyard and when the last one went home, I fell right asleep. It‚Äôs such a nice thing to see friends right now, especially when you can share some wine and lots of laughs.</p>
<p>This week is a mix of weird and sad as usual. I‚Äôm working on some longer form posts for brookshelley.com in the coming week about backpacking and mechanical keyboards, so keep your eyes peeled for those too.</p>

<li>What if environmentalism but also <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/06/26/the-big-green-lie/">racist and xenophobic</a>? Unsurprisingly the global north doesn‚Äôt want to talk about our role in destroying the planet through unreasonable use of resources. It‚Äôs just so much easier to blame the ‚Äúother‚Äù of the global south for having children, or daring to build industry. The sooner we see Earth as a planet we all need to share equally, the better in my mind.</li>
<li>Speaking of resources, I watched quite a bit of the TV show Alone over the past few weeks in preparation for a <em>podcast</em> and I wondered, ‚Äúhow easy would it be for them to harvest salt from the ocean to season their dang food?‚Äù The answer, it turns out, is both <a href="https://www.outdoorrevival.com/instant-articles/harvesting-salt-from-the-ocean-a-great-skill-to-learn.html">not too hard</a>, and very challenging to do in a survival situation. I super hope on some season someone becomes a master of seasoning.</li>

<li>The MASK toys led me down a bit of a curiosity hole, and I found out a <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Rubsign">cool feature of Transformers</a> was <em>actually</em> a way of verifying toys weren‚Äôt <a href="http://www.collectiondx.com/toy_line/bootleg">bootleg</a>.

<p>Sorry about the delay! I am writing this conclusion while I watch the Belgian Grand Prix, grateful that F1 has managed to race despite not having a <em>bubble</em>. This week was long, but next week I‚Äôm on <em>vacation</em>! I‚Äôm excited, even if I don‚Äôt get to do much outdoor adventuring due to the smoke that blankets so much of California right now.

<li>Now that it‚Äôs reached the end of an 8 year run, I can safely send you to the delightful series <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-1-title-page/">Oh Human Star</a>. Perhaps someone can share with me a good way of keeping track of your progress through a web comic, but I‚Äôve been reading this via a manual updated bookmark for a while. It‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs queer, and Blue is a really nice human.</li>
<li>As a stock market player/money-haver who previously worries about having food to eat and electricity as a kid, it‚Äôs very apparent to me how huge a gap there is between the rich and the poor. Here‚Äôs more about <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/stock-market-real-economy-disconnect-unemployment-poverty-coronavirus-trump">that horrific reality</a>. What if we all committed to addressing this wealth and economy gap in our lifetimes?</li>
<li>WOW, I hope you like uncontrollable bathroom problems! Remember Olestra? <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-failure-of-the-fat-free-revolution/">Remember that whole nightmare?</a> I certainly do. For some reason (diet culture) my family was really into Wow chips, even once it was somewhat obvious that they were going though us like <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727278-tips-lose-weight-after-quarantine/">konjac</a>.

My friend <a href="http://helentseng.com">Helen</a> gave me <a href="https://phonebreakup.com">this book</a> a year or two ago, and it was pretty helpful in finding new ways to be a little more at peace with my devices.</li>

<p>What‚Äôs one thing you want to do this week that makes you happy? For me, it‚Äôs making rice pudding. I love rice pudding and I‚Äôve never cooked it, so I‚Äôm pretty amped. Oh, and I‚Äôm baking more bread, obviously. I also <em>treated</em> myself to a game from my wish list: Farcry 5. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs deeply strange and I can‚Äôt wait to dive in.</p>

<p>This weeks email was written an entire day early as I plan to head up a mountain and camp for a night. It&rsquo;s going to be <a href="https://weatherwest.com/archives/7427"><em>hot</em></a> so I hope the mountain is a little cooler. This will be round one of camping during quarantine, and my first camping trip since 2017! I&rsquo;ve finally found friends who are equally interested in camping and hit me up when they want to do so. It rules.</p>
<p>With a VP candidate announced, and the USPS falling apart, it&rsquo;s beginning to look at lot like <em>election season</em>. Please vote (for Biden). I know, he&rsquo;s not great, but he&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got this time. Next time, let&rsquo;s primary the awful old white men.</p>
<p>With that weather and politics update out of the way, let&rsquo;s get to these links.</p>

This is a bracing set of answers that feel pretty close to how I&rsquo;m feeling these days. Also I have a soft spot for Canadian ex-pats who grew up in Texas.</li>
<li>Frequently linked author Robin Sloan has a new story online that he <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/books/annabel-scheme-serial/">built a whole reading platform</a> around. It&rsquo;s pretty fun and weird, like most of his writing. Recommended.</li>

<li>I deeply respect swifts` attitudes toward the ground, which is roughly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/vesper-flights.html">&ldquo;fuck the ground&rdquo;</a>. Honestly if I could fly, I might feel the same. Also you&rsquo;ve gotta love a bird that was once &ldquo;called the ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs bird,‚Äù perhaps because those screaming flocks of black crosses around churches seemed pulled from darkness, not light.&rdquo;</li>

      <content:encoded><p>How‚Äôs your August going? Are you doing any hiking or swimming? Planning any solo adventures? I‚Äôm planning a backpacking trip in the near future that has me pretty stoked, especially because of all the gear I get to buy and try out. I‚Äôm a sucker for gear, <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">obviously</a>. I spent all of Saturday finishing the latest Tamsyn Muir book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/harrow-the-ninth/9781250313225">Harrow the Ninth</a>, and eating oysters with a couple pals at an outdoor distance (hi Christine and Anna).</p>
<p>I also almost forgot to write this week‚Äôs email, as I decided to redo the CSS for my website <em>yet again</em> and watch the movie Prometheus after waking from my book stupor. Luckily, I remembered right before bed, so apologies if this is a bit loopy.</p>

<li>Let‚Äôs talk about <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-attachment-theory-works-in-the-therapeutic-relationship"><em>attachment theory</em></a>, baybee, let‚Äôs talk about you and your therapist. I‚Äôve happily gone to therapy for the past decade, and if you haven‚Äôt found a therapist you like, perhaps read this and then just go find one.</li>
<li>One of the loveliest ways to fix broken things is with gold&hellip; even if the broken thing is a <a href="https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/kintsugi-court-victor-solomon-video">basketball court</a>.</li>
<li>Did you play with LEGO as a kid? Do you still enjoy it as an adult? You might love this deep-dive into <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/">LEGO instrument panels</a>. For my part, I‚Äôve only bought one lego item since the quarantine began, because I fear if I buy more I will have a house filled with whimsical cities and vehicles at an upsetting rate.</li>
<li>Do you edit photos for a blog? You might enjoy <a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2020/08/06/exactpic-a-shortcut-for-precise-image-outputs-on-ios/">Khoi Vinh‚Äôs photo resize shortcut for iOS</a>.

<p>I can‚Äôt believe summer is almost over! I think I talked about this last week too, but it‚Äôs wild to me that summer has largely happened indoors, with nary a lake or pool in my life. I‚Äôm pretty excited about the opportunity to go camping soonish though, because I‚Äôve really missed being able to hike and camp since leaving Texas and my outdoor pals behind. Hopefully in the coming weeks I‚Äôll have some exciting (but not too exciting) photos and stories to share from <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-08-07-a-few-weeks-with-a/">my new camera</a>.

      <content:encoded><p>Another weekend is upon us! Blessed weekend! It‚Äôs August, can you believe it?! I read some old journal entries today from the <em>before times</em> and it‚Äôs funny to see how much my life and activities were the same as they are now. When this pandemic is wrapped-up, I know I‚Äôll appreciate a quick visit to a wine bar much more, at least for a few weeks. This week also marked the end of my second month of 3x a week workout classes, which I <em>think</em> is making a difference in my energy and emotional health. Have you gotten some exercise recently? Even some stretches can be nice, trust me. Either way, let‚Äôs both take a deep inhale&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and a big exhale.</p>
<p>There now, you‚Äôre ready for <em>these links</em>.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>This week marked the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2020-hugo-awards/">2020 Hugo awards</a>, which means if you enjoy sci-fi and haven‚Äôt read a ton this year, you‚Äôll have quite a bit of excellent stuff to catch up on. My plan is to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Skin-Forward-collection-Jemisin-ebook/dp/B07VFMFPP4">Emergency Skin by N.K. Jemison</a> this weekend.</li>
<li>You may have heard about QAnon, the weird new conspiracy cult that popped-up over the past few years, but did you know how it‚Äôs <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/qanon-conspiracy-cult-losing-family">destroying families</a>? It turns out when you believe absolutely ridiculous theories, your friends and family tend to steer clear. I‚Äôm very curious, and more than a little scared to find out how this whole Q thing shakes out.</li>
<li>Listen, it might be a rather solitary fall out there, but there‚Äôs no reason for you not to look your best. <a href="https://tienda.baumm.com/us/camperas/">These jackets</a> are a great way to say ‚Äúfuck it, I dress for me!‚Äù</li>
<li>If you‚Äôve already read all the Hugo-nominated novels and novellas, perhaps you might want to follow BDG‚Äôs example and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEWEdIcx1DI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1381">drown your sorrows in Halo</a>. As a one-time reader of Magic the Gathering and Battletech novels, I think I‚Äôll give them a wide-berth, but your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>This week marked the often bizarre (thanks a lot go-go juice) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/30/21346575/tech-antitrust-hearing-recap-bezos-zuckerberg-cook-pichai">anti-trust hearing </a>with the leaders of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. There‚Äôs a lot to worry about with the consolidation of power and influence in these tech titans, and <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/blog/issue-23-editors-note">I‚Äôm not the only one</a> considering how COVID isolation bolsters it.</li>
<li>Finally, I decided to pick up a <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iii">fancy new camera</a> to give myself even more reason to go outside and explore a little during this quarantine. It‚Äôs been pretty fun, even if most of the photos I‚Äôve taken are of my cat, Snorri.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>With the summer dwindling and a very cozy fall in our near future, I hope you‚Äôre taking care of yourself, and stockpiling wool blankets and candles. I‚Äôm pretty excited for a few books and shows that will launch in the coming months, not to mention the rest of the F1 season still to come. I‚Äôm not fully sure what it‚Äôll feel like to keep going with this largely self-quarantined life until next year, but we‚Äôll all learn together, one week at a time. Take care, and enjoy a lazy Sunday for me, space cowgirls~</p>

Perhaps we should instead not require the post office to turn a profit? Thank your postal worker in the meantime, because they‚Äôre literally risking their lives to serve us.</li>

Turns out. I wish we had zero sales tax (it‚Äôs regressive), and a high living wage for all workers that didn‚Äôt need to go to healthcare. I‚Äôm trying to think a little bit about a positive future in the ruins of pre-covid world, especially after reading <a href="https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/134/">50 folks in Monocle thinking big</a>.</li>

      <content:encoded><p>Another week, and another Formula One race in Austria. For the first time in the over 70 year history¬†of this race series two races occurred at the same track. The first race included loads of suspension and tire issues due to curbs, and this weekend included with a veritable lake on the track. If you‚Äôve never watched car racing, I recommend Netflix‚Äôs excellent <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890?s=i&amp;trkid=0">behind-the-scenes series</a>. Outside of high speed racing, my week was a bit of a let-down, as I found out I didn‚Äôt get a position at work I‚Äôd interviewed for on Wednesday. Chin up though, I have to think, as there will be more opportunities to come. Hopefully your week had some nice news instead!</p>

<li>This week I learned a lot more than I ever thought I would <a href="https://hyakumonogatari.com/2013/08/30/tanuki-no-kintama-tanukis-giant-balls/">about tanukis</a>, the raccoon dog native to Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs a raccoon chaser for that wild article:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you see ‚Äúthe letter‚Äù this week? The sad, out of touch, last-gasp of milquetoast ‚Äúintellectuals‚Äù who can‚Äôt be bothered to care about the hoi polloi? Regardless (or ‚Äúirregardless‚Äù, lol, that‚Äôs another story from this summer), this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320338/letter-harpers-writers-free-speech-canceled-social-media-illiberalism">piece by Sarah Jeong</a> is an excellent look at Harper‚Äôs garbage missive.</li>
<li>I can‚Äôt believe I only <em>just this week</em> discovered David Rees‚Äô <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Going-Deep-David-Rees-Season/dp/B00M50KCGA">Going Deep</a> tv show and it‚Äôs excellent investigation of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_loris">slow loris</a>. If you want to see David talk about his career and the ups and downs of being a cartoonist and comedian, this <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/videos/david-rees">excellent talk from XOXO 2016</a> will fill that desire.</li>
<li>Finally, and inexplicably, I leave you with this:</li>

<p>Thanks again for reading, and spending your summer indoors virtually with my internet history and curiosity. August is fast approaching, but the weather outside is still gorgeous here. I hope you‚Äôre able to spend a few hours in the sun this weekend, quietly appreciating the distance from other people, and maybe reading a good book. As always, stay safe and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Well, the long weekend and constant fireworks in Oakland threw me for a loop! I lost track of the days and thought it was Saturday, and I still had an entire evening to prepare this email for you.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Well, the long weekend and constant fireworks in Oakland threw me for a loop! I lost track of the days and thought it was Saturday, and I still had an entire evening to prepare this email for you. Alas! Here‚Äôs a rare evening edition my newsletter.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>This account is utterly bizarre and so are <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=6476370&amp;id=5A1B20E2-AA1D-434F-A62E-44497ADF7F68">these warnings</a>. There‚Äôs a strangely surreal aspect to a lot of the governments social media, that I can‚Äôt tell whether I find charming or depressing.</li>
<li>If you‚Äôre worried about radiation, you could get a dosimeter, but why not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/jan/08/colour-changing-cats-warn-radioactive-waste-nuclear-plants-distant-descendants">breed cats to change colors instead</a>?</li>
<li>if you need something great to read during the quarantine, why not dive into this short fiction from Murakami <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/confessions-of-a-shinagawa-monkey">about a monkey</a>.</li>
<li>Building <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/chatbots-at-the-end-of-the-world-connolly">customer service robots while the world burns?</a> That‚Äôs par for the course in Silicon Valley. That, and continuously attacking a journalist for reporting on the industry. It would be pretty amazing if folks decided to work on global warming or other pressing global crises, but until then, I guess returning my yoga pants will be better.</li>
<li>I finished watching Berlin Station this week, and also decided to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olen_Steinhauer">the writer</a> of the show‚Äôs book series about CIA Tourists.</li>
<li>Does anyone know why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúchankonabe/„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÅìÈçã‚ÄùÔºüI can‚Äôt for the life of me find out the etymology of that dish. If you know, <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">hit me up</a>.</li>
<li>In honor of July 4th, do everyone a favor and read about the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/">racial wealth gap</a>. American capitalism is a pernicious force of white supremacy, and we‚Äôve got to change things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for bearing with me this evening and being patient for these links. I hope your week is relaxing, and you are able to stay inside/social distance and avoid the spike of COVID that‚Äôs ravaging most of the states. Keep fighting, and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>The bay this week was thankfully cooler than the past month. My body was thankful for the heat respite, and Snorri was cuddlier as a result.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>The bay this week was thankfully cooler than the past month. My body was thankful for the heat respite, and Snorri was cuddlier as a result. This week felt long, after having Juneteenth off last week, but next Friday we observe Independence Day, so it‚Äôs another short week. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm looking forward to the even more ubiquitous fireworks, but hopefully the cops will finally run out.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time watching tv this week, and enjoying good <a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/ichiros-malt-and-grain-whisky/">Japanese Whiskey</a>. Hopefully you had some fun things to occupy your time as well. Oh, and I also spent an inordinate amount of time trying to fix my bike chain and rear derailleur‚Äîbike shops have 10 day waits, so needs must. I turns out I‚Äôve forgotten most of my bike mechanic skills.</p>
<p>What skills have you forgotten/tried to learn?</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two more comics to start us off: <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/gideon-falls">Gideon Falls</a>, which is pretty damn creepy, and <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/adventureman-1">Adventureman</a>, which fortunately seems to be about a woman. The comics world is finally reckoning with predation and abusive men, which hopefully means even more great people will be able to produce content instead. Comics, other than distribution, seem to be ideally suited for quarantine creation, and it would be rad to see a new set of voices show up in print soon.</li>
<li>Speaking of fancy whiskey, before this quarantine Chinese and American customers were swiftly burning through the <a href="http://archive.is/sGUeM">stocks of all the greatest bottles</a>. I‚Äôve heard from friends in Japan that it‚Äôs not even possible to buy a lot of great whiskeys there unless you know someone at the distillery. Production is likely ramping-up to meet demand, but it might be 5 or more years before we see the results. I plan to still enjoy Japanese whiskey then too. My favorite remains <a href="https://distiller.com/spirits/nikka-coffey-grain-whisky">Nikka Coffey Grain</a>, except when I‚Äôm in Japan and can consistently get this <a href="https://distiller.com/spirits/nikka-taketsuru-pure-malt-17-year">17 year delight</a>.</li>
<li>I dove headlong into a new tv show from HBO Europe this week: Beforeigners, which was as fun and silly as the name. Ostensibly, it‚Äôs a detective show, but the primary conceit is that folks keep popping up in the ocean from ancient Norse villages. I learned about a lot of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russefeiring">strange</a> rituals and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorir_Hund">characters from Snorri‚Äôs book</a> Heimskringkla. I also love that Vikings called Jesus, <a href="http://vikinganswerlady.com/hvitkrst.shtml">‚Äúthe white christ‚Äù</a>. Showing up in a new country and saying ‚Äúthis is your new religion‚Äù is a total dick move, in my opinion. I wonder if any sci-fi about this exists, wherein aliens pop down to earth to convert everyone to worship space Hubbard?</li>

<li>This is the third time I‚Äôve brought up alcohol in this email, but this one is about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-23/are-people-drinking-more-booze-during-coronavirus-apparently-not">drinking <em>less</em></a>. I think I‚Äôm likely drinking more than usual, but maybe that just balances out everyone else who apparently can only drink at bars.</li>
<li>On Friday night, I was waxing rhapsodic about the magazine Giant Robot (RIP), and then decided to check out what they‚Äôd blogged about since shutting down their print run. <a href="https://www.giantrobot.com/blogs/giant-robot-store-and-gr2-news/poston">This piece</a> by Eric Nakamura about his dad, Bob, returning to the internment camp he was forced into by xenophobic and racist white Americans during WWII was sad and beautiful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it‚Äôs time for me to return to my world of tv amateur bike wrenching, and <a href="https://womensfoundationoforegon.org">funding cool non-profits</a>. I hope you are also watching the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80100172?s=i&amp;trkid=0">new season of Dark</a>, and enjoying the summer wherever you are reading this.

      <description>It‚Äôs a foggy, overcast Saturday as I write this newsletter. Yesterday, my company gave Juneteenth off as time to volunteer and remember, and I spent most of the day with the Women‚Äôs Foundation of Oregon discussing budgets and our COVID relief fund.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>It‚Äôs a foggy, overcast Saturday as I write this newsletter. Yesterday, my company gave <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/6/19/17476482/juneteenth-holiday-emancipation-african-american-celebration-history">Juneteenth</a> off as time to volunteer and remember, and I spent most of the day with the Women‚Äôs Foundation of Oregon discussing budgets and our <a href="https://womensfoundationoforegon.org/explore-our-grantmaking/our-grantmaking/covid-19-rapid-response-fund">COVID relief fund</a>. As a Texan, I grew up hearing about Juneteenth, but still hadn‚Äôt fully understood Texas as ‚Äúpart of the south‚Äù until a few years ago, since Austin had firmly insulated itself from owning our history. Take some time to read about Juneteenth, and why its the real Independence Day for our country.</p>
<p>(Insert picture of Snorri)</p>
<p>My good friend Snorri stood on my shoulder for this part, so I figured I should add a photo of him saying hi. Do you have a pet? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Send me a photo</a> of your pet being cute. I‚Äôm heartened by how many friends have adopted pets during this quarantine, and it feels like almost every week there are new cats showing up in our cats channel at work. I‚Äôm still studying how Snorri handles being permanently shelter-in-place for tips on how to deal with COVID. Mostly, it seems like the key is naps and purring.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs get to the links!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>These <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/how-i-got-my-attention-back/">two</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/six-weeks-100s-miles-hours-glorious-boredom-japan/">essays</a> from Craig Mod are a very interesting look at attention and hiking. If you‚Äôre anything like me, it‚Äôs pretty hard to look away from the constant pull of the news and minute-to-minute narration of current events Twitter brings us every day. I‚Äôve still largely stuck to my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-02-22-a-twitter-experiment-using-rss-to-readonly-twitter/">RSS Twitter diet</a>, which I still recommend, but I still load the news up on Google or Apple a few times a day. It‚Äôs super important to stay informed, but I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about the cycles of meaningless scrolling we all get into.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The man above makes what I call ‚ÄúBeEDM‚Äù. I‚Äôm fascinated by the combination of shed-made electronic music, with beekeeping. If bees aren‚Äôt your thing, you can instead <a href="https://www.midisprout.com">make music from your plants</a>. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs hard to beat music that cats make.</li>

<li>Robin Sloan is on a roll lately! This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2020/05/conspiracy-museum/610984/">piece in the Atlantic</a> was a delight, and he‚Äôs also serializing some fiction in the local paper every day too. The guy also makes a <a href="https://fat.gold">pretty solid olive oil</a>, which I received yesterday for the first time, and immediately poured on my sourdough.</li>
<li>I planned to send a few comic recommendations, but one of the folks who I‚Äôve been reading lately was revealed to be a predator this week, so I‚Äôll only give you one recommendation. The creator of Blade of the Immortal has two new series, and one of them is all about female assassins: <a href="https://kodanshacomics.com/series/die-wergelder/">Die Wergelder</a>. It rules. The other series is on my to-watch list, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave,_Listen_to_Me">anime just aired</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, the clouds have parted, and Saturday is looking sunny and nice. I think after I take today‚Äôs loaf out of the oven, I‚Äôll go on a bike ride with a few friends at a distance and maybe pick up <a href="https://fieldworkbrewing.com">some beer</a>. I hope your Sunday is lovely, and your week is fully of love, solidarity, and rest. Stay safe, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll keep sending out these link emails every week though, as I think it‚Äôs important to read and see things that can surprise, delight, or teach us even as we mourn and fight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<ul>
<li>I wish William Gibson was a little less prescient sometimes. <a href="https://thequietus.com/articles/28340-william-gibson-agency-interview">This interivew</a> with the author talks about his latest work, and the eeriness of his writing about ‚Äúthe jackpot‚Äù. I recently reread Gibson‚Äôs Blue Ant trilogy, which was coincident with a growth in stealth brands, surveillance culture, and AR. I think it will ultimately hold up a bit better for me than the Peripheral or Agency, but it‚Äôs nice to see him still so masterfully creating fiction.</li>

<li>With some good music queued up, let‚Äôs read about <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/software_slump/">slow software</a>. I don‚Äôt agree with everything Craig concludes here, but I appreciate his digging into what makes software good and bad, and the thread he started of software folks enjoy. I sincerely hope that WWDC in two weeks brings ARM chips to the Mac, and with it, better speed and battery life. Times are rough in so many ways, but there‚Äôs still a surprising amount of interesting technology being released and neat software to play around with too.</li>

Reading this took me way back to the earlier days of the internet in a similar fashion to the book <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?470007-1/joanne-mcneil-discusses-lurking">Lurking</a>. In a lot of ways, I think I miss the time where sites were static, and the social net was IRC, forums, and email. I‚Äôm curious to see what the next ten years looks like: what is Web 4.0? Web 10.0?</li>
<li>On Friday, I wrote about my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-12-stoked-on-survivor/">newfound love for the tv show Survivor</a>. It‚Äôs a very silly show, but powering through seasons is giving me a lot of joy right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is bringing you joy lately? Baking? Pets? The idea that we can have more police-free autonomous zones? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Let me know</a>. I‚Äôll be biking a bit this weekend to enjoy the blue skies in the bay, so if you see me <em>wave at a distance</em> and be sure to take care of yourself too.

      <content:encoded><p>This is my eleventh week in quarantine, since I was in Japan when the Bay Area shut down. COVID is still scary, but it‚Äôs been an even harder week due to police violence against black Americans, murdering multiple people and assaulting countless more. Fuck the cops. Fuck the violent, racist state.</p>
<p>With that said, I will go ahead and share some links, as usual, with a few that may help you grapple with what‚Äôs happening right now. Take care of yourself, your friends and family, and especially be in solidarity with black and brown folks who‚Äôre consistently targeted by state and individual white supremacist violence.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Here‚Äôs a book on <a href="https://robindiangelo.com/publications/">White Fragility</a>. Read it if you‚Äôre white, or have white folks around you or in your family. I‚Äôm picking up a copy on recommendation of some rad folks I know.</li>
<li>Here‚Äôs <a href="https://harukanakamurapianoensemble.bandcamp.com/album/hikari">an album</a> I‚Äôm listening to a lot these days while I try to sit and feel things.</li>

<li>
<p>When I lived in Portland, I spent a lot of time going to a sangha with other folks where we meditated and learned about Buddhism. I can‚Äôt say that I always loved it, but it was definitely helpful. If you live in the East Bay, or just want to go to one regularly, <a href="https://eastbaymeditation.org/programs/zoom-links/">here‚Äôs some classes</a> to check out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to imagine the future, a great way to start is by reading black women and <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2020/04/24/how-black-women-are-reshaping-afrofuturism/">Afrofuturism</a>. So much of sci-fi is white and colonialist as fuck, and exposing myself to authors who are neither white or men is something I‚Äôve really valued over the past five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week I wrote about my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-01-adventures-in-baking/">baking adventures</a>. It‚Äôs been a really nice thing to make bread constantly in order to feed myself, and have a small project that delivers little victories every so often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While working on my site over the past few weeks, I thought a lot about the <a href="http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html">handmade web</a> of the past‚Äîbefore the time of large social networks with shitty policies. If you haven‚Äôt built your own website or newsletter in a while, maybe give it a go. It‚Äôs pretty fun.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know the note at the top was somber, but it‚Äôs time for being somber. Thank you to anyone who is donating, supporting folks, protesting, or otherwise involved in this pivotal moment in US history. I fully believe that if we stick to this fight, we can change things. If you‚Äôre reading this, even if I don‚Äôt know you, just know I care about you, and I appreciate your attention. Thanks for being part of this slow newsletter social world. Keep resisting, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>It&rsquo;s been a busy week! At my company, we had Monday and Friday off, and most of our staff took off the entire week. I decided to work through the week for some reason, and ended-up getting a lot done! Suffering from a bout of creative excitement, I also <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-05-30-blog-redesign/">redesigned my site</a> to try to beat the <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">Google performance measure</a> and load fully under two seconds. Yes. I&rsquo;m a frontend pervert. At one point I almost ditched the entire site and rebuilt it in <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/css/">CSS grid</a>, but cooler heads prevailed (I got a little drunk and decided to just finish the redesign instead).</p>
<p>Did you know we have a <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Marina_Home/">cool marina</a> near our IKEA? My pal Andr√© showed it to me in a socially distant bike ride, and it&rsquo;s super fun to ride to, despite the slightly crowded trails. I&rsquo;m trying to balance my desire to never leave the house with my need for exercise, so we&rsquo;ll see how many times I head to the marina in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re also not leaving the house much, but you do you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some <em>links</em>!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s summer now? It&rsquo;s definitely hot, and so I&rsquo;ve started reading more Scandinavian fiction to keep the heat low in my head at least. Let&rsquo;s dive into the <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-summer-book/9781590172681">world of Tove Jansson</a> together, shall we?</li>
<li>Whether you&rsquo;re baking a lot now or not, I bet you don&rsquo;t know what makes b<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/what-is-the-difference-between-baking-powder-and-baking-soda-in-pancakes.html">aking soda and baking powder</a> different.  There&rsquo;s your exciting cocktail fact for the week.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m hiding this one 3 links in to try to fool a friend (hi Drew) into <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">reading it</a>. It&rsquo;s all about making Google Fonts faster, and since I know you all love performance fuckery, you&rsquo;ll get a kick out of it.</li>
<li>Every time I return from Japan, I think &ldquo;why do our trains suck so much?!&rdquo; In comparison with most of Europe and Asia, the United States lags far behind on train transport, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lawmaker-wants-fast-trains-rev-us-economy/">perhaps not for long</a>. I really hope I get to see high-speed rail in the states while I&rsquo;m young.</li>
<li>Finally, here&rsquo;s America&rsquo;s number one Merlin <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/7593305-merlin-mann">talking about his favorite Elliot Smith</a> song.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a lot less fun link excavating this week because&hellip; well, have you seen the news? All I&rsquo;ll say about it is: Black lives matter, and cops should be held accountable for their atrocities &amp; Section 230 makes the social web work.</p>
<p>I hope you have some time away from the horrors and sad things of the world, and can take care of yourself, your family, and your friends this week. I&rsquo;m rooting for you, and I&rsquo;ll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Welp, first sunburn of the quarantine for this gal. I spent the afternoon in a friend‚Äôs yard (hi Andr√© and Haley) and forgot my skin has been softened by indoor lighting for months.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Welp, first sunburn of the quarantine for this gal. I spent the afternoon in a friend‚Äôs yard (hi Andr√© and Haley) and forgot my skin has been softened by indoor lighting for months. On the upside, it was gorgeous outside, and I‚Äôm glad I got to sit in the sun.</p>
<p>Since I‚Äôll be indoors for a while healing-up, a lot of todays‚Äôs links are indoor kid interests. So if you‚Äôre like me, I think you‚Äôll enjoy these:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, here‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.girlwalkallday.com/chapters-page">gorgeous dance movie</a> that I‚Äôve had on my to-watch list for a while. It‚Äôs surreal to watch right now, since it involves a lot of public contact and even a subway ride in NYC, but it‚Äôs a nice reminder of the fun times.</li>
<li>Next, lets do a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-guide-to-dune-s-strange-and-intense-religions-1843460283">deep-dive into the religions of Dune</a>. I personally love the oddball Bene Gesserit, and one of my regrets of my previous startup selling to another company is our next code sprint title series could‚Äôve been Dune names. Alas.</li>
<li>If reading about Dune makes you want to ship some of the characters, make sure you don‚Äôt make them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html">awkwardly lupine</a>. There‚Äôs a lawsuit brewing at the intersection of fan fiction and self-published ebooks that will help establish case law around shared universes. I get t feeling the Omegaverse (read the above to know more) will stay open to all.</li>
<li>This next one is a twofer on grammar. Why do we <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/all-your-questions-about-pronoun-deletion-and-the-inexorable-death-of-the-universe-answered.html">delete initial pronouns in English</a> lately? And how does that same deletion <a href="https://nihongoperapera.com/dirty-japanese-guide-subjects-and-deletions.html">function in Japanese</a>? I journal quite a bit and speak Japanese decently, so I‚Äôve run into this concept of deletion and assumed context sentences often. I think it‚Äôs a pretty fascinating concept.</li>
<li>Here‚Äôs something else to watch: <a href="https://kotaku.com/8-great-anime-series-for-people-who-don-t-like-anime-1843616852">anime for folks who haven‚Äôt seen anime</a>. I‚Äôve seen quite a few if these and can vouch for them.</li>
<li>Finally, let‚Äôs talk ‚Äúwarshers‚Äù and ‚Äúdiddles‚Äù in the <a href="http://www.washers.org/terms.html#diddle">most high-stake professional sport in America</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This image is care of Joe‚Äîthanks Joe! It‚Äôs an emoji keyboard from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/gph0lk/alps_kanji_keyboard_exotic_peripherals_week/">Reddit on strange peripherals</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.redd.it/3vs4r3ci8m051.jpg" alt="keyboard"></p>
<p>Well, that‚Äôs it for this week. I‚Äôve spent a lot of this weekend already playing a silly war game with friends, and it‚Äôs highly likely I‚Äôll keep that going. More bread making as well. I hope you have a chill short week, and don‚Äôt randomly set off fireworks like all my neighbors&hellip; yikes.<br>
See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Trying out a new name for this that isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlinks‚Äù. Fennel and dill are two of my favorite flavors, but also a terrible combination.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Trying out a new name for this that isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlinks‚Äù. Fennel and dill are two of my favorite flavors, but also a terrible combination. They also happen to be my utterly bizarre chest-piece tattoo. If you follow this newsletter but haven‚Äôt ever met me in person, just know I have a <em>lot</em> of botanical tattoos.</p>
<p>My snacking game is strong now that I know how to make my own tortillas on demand, and endless sourdough. However, it‚Äôs been a while since I had some of these little treats, and I am officially missing tater tots:</p>

</div>

<p>Maybe I‚Äôll try to cook some up sometime. It seems pretty challenging though. Putting this on a list that also includes homemade lefse and ableskiver.</p>
<p>Do you <em>you</em> like refrigerators?</p>

</div>

<p>I love the <a href="http://www.cc.com/shows/detroiters">Detroiters</a>-level excellence of this ad. It‚Äôs utterly brilliant to just show the man I presume owns the shop slowly walking towards the camera. This is cinema.</p>
<p>If that wet your whistle, let‚Äôs dive in for a full link immersion.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have you seen the very good Middleditch &amp; Schwartz special yet? If you need more of those two funny fellows, try this video of them playing a Jackbox game:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Perhaps videos aren‚Äôt your thing, and you‚Äôre more of a reading fan. Reading is my favorite thing, and one of my only consistent hobbies, so it was awesome to find <a href="https://lithub.com/26-books-from-the-last-decade-that-if-you-havent-read-you-should/">this list</a> via <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com">Robin Sloan</a> of excellent books you‚Äôve likely not read, recommended by authors who are also rad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you still managed to avoid the siren song of Animal Crossing? I keep oversleeping/baking instead of buying turnips, so unlike some people I know, I‚Äôm not yet in a post-money economy. I‚Äôve got bills to pay! Even still, I find this quarantine-time <a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1261295269338992640?s=20">live playing of the theme song</a> just delightful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm a big Formula 1 fan, which you might not know, but one of my least favoriting things about it is the lack of women driving in the sport. Luckily, there are efforts to sponsor and develop professional drivers, and I hope eventually Formula 1 teams and sponsors get over their misogyny and have <a href="https://wseries.com">some of these awesome women</a> drive in the most prestigious series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, deep into quarantine I‚Äôve continued to bake up a storm, and I think this is my best boule so far!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/boule.jpg" alt="boule"></p>
<p>I‚Äôve got another one in the oven this morning, and I hope it turns out well. Also if you‚Äôre the sort of person who practices witchcraft, or otherwise wants to send some good vibes my way&hellip; Friday could be very interesting. Hopefully I can share more, and it‚Äôs good news. Short version is I‚Äôm trying to do something very neat at work.</p>
<p>I hope however you spend your next week, it‚Äôs a good one, and as always, I‚Äôll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Ten loaves of sourdough! That‚Äôs how many loaves I have made thus far during the pandemic (or pan-demic if you‚Äôll excuse my pun). Have you found a fulfilling hobby? Gotten really good at a driving simulator? Taken up <a href="https://www.cowaymega.com/product/coway-bidetmega-400/">amateur plumbing</a>? I went out last weekend for the first time, albeit just down the street to sit in a friend‚Äôs yard, far from said friend. It was pretty nice, and I keep thinking I should perhaps do a little more biking and walking, but then I see a dozen people walking around massless, and I get some combination of furious and scared all over again.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs hoping this week‚Äôs links will give you some chill times, and maybe even some laughs instead. Here‚Äôs some mood music:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you miss clubbing? Just getting hopped up on some fundrugs‚Ñ¢ and shaking your booty in hopes you might get to swap spit with a cutie? Well, sans the spit bit, you might be in luck if <a href="https://www.core77.com/posts/98066/No-Social-Distancing-Required-Personal-Protective-Suit-Concept-Designed-for-Nightlife">you can make one of these</a>. I love this bonkers concept, because it imagines a world in which people are somehow ok with wearing spacesuits to go to a bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt think any friends have taken me up on this, but I for sure wish they would try to cut their own hair with a shop vac. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-my-hair-with-a-vacuum-cleaner-and-oh-man-i-think-1843204420">I love it</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the previous song is over, here‚Äôs a bit more mall music to tide you over as you read these next few pieces:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<ul>
<li>The fantastic essayist Rebecca Solnit covered everything from pandemic profiteering to the hope that we come out of this with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit">greater respect and understanding of our interconnectedness</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here‚Äôs so music to bring you back from the depths that essay may have taken you through:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Finally, I want to leave you with the single best video series I‚Äôve seen in a while‚Äîa cat sleeping on a piano while their owner gently plays, the hammers massaging them.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>I hope these links have brought you some joy, and led you through a few interesting paths. I‚Äôm off to enjoy Sonic the Hedgehog in preparation for listening to this week‚Äôs Flop House. You can follow along with my cinematic misadventures <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/movies">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.letterboxd.com/brookshelley/films/">here</a>. If it‚Äôs sunny today, try to sit by a window or go on a chill socially distant walk. I went on my first bike ride since February yesterday, and though it was short, it really helped me feel a little more ok. It‚Äôs hard to remember, at least over here, that despite this feeling like forever, it‚Äôs only been two months. For how ever much time we have in lockdown, I‚Äôll keep sending emails to you every week, and keep on baking very, very surprisingly good sourdough. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Happy May! We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Happy May! We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you&rsquo;re well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been cleaning, rearranging, and making lots of bread‚ÄîI think I&rsquo;ve finally sorted out my Sourdough woes.</p>
<p>One thing I can recommend for anyone looking to clean up a little are <em>a bunch</em> of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Reusable-Fastening-Organizing/dp/B001E1Y5O6">little velcro strips</a> to manage those cables. These little fellows are super versatile, reusable, and the package will probably last the rest of your life. What value!</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t installed a desk and a nice office chair yet, I can heartily recommend doing so. I was sitting at my dining room table until Friday, on a modern but unsupportive kitchen chair. Ow. Now I have a Herman Miller Sayl, and a cool little desk to keep my stuff away from the &ldquo;food zone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As we go through this week, I hope you have as much energy as all these cool ladies:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCO0DXAc0tk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Cool, right? Here&rsquo;s some links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you like memes? Do you like AI? <a href="https://imgflip.com/ai-meme?fbclid=IwAR2Z87afCI_yG2HsTyRgoa1yp5MytCPW2OB-X_TkttmJegoHnYp9BGolTg0">Boom</a>. Someone put these two forces together, and it&rsquo;s an eerie laugh riot. A coworker never really understands memes, so I can&rsquo;t wait to just start sending him these.</li>
<li>Did you know Jia Tolentino is younger than me? I sure didn&rsquo;t! I haven&rsquo;t read Trick Mirror yet, but she&rsquo;s pretty damn cool, I think. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jia-tolentino-interview-trick-mirror-962686/">This interview</a> gave me a lot of insight into her world, and more interest in picking it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next few links are related to a mindset for quarantine and the pandemic. Don‚Äôt worry if you feel like skipping them. I found them supremely helpful, but your mileage may vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it seems that <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2020/04/take-the-long-view/">taking the long view</a> on terrible events may help us put our own suffering and frustration in context. Terrible things have happened to so many of us, and more will happen in the future, but the span of time we‚Äôre alive is vast compared to these months of difficulty.</li>
<li>As a life post-pandemic begins, we should ‚Äúprioritise people and societies, ecologies and environments, ahead of profit and productivity.‚Äù It‚Äôs not only possible for us to use this global crisis as a catalyst, I believe it‚Äôs absolutely vital. There is no ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to return to, because ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was always fucking terrible for millions. Let‚Äôs build a world we will be proud to hand off to the future inhabitants of Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I blogged about this before, but there‚Äôs a whole troupe of bloggers doing a regular column over at <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/">Indoor Voices</a>, but one of the coolest ones is Coffeecore:</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ob-X-j_hHS8/XqkGuwjkc1I/AAAAAAAAK4w/oGC5MO2D6QkSBCvIzp_zH5uQjmeqW109ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/sailorroundwindow.gif" alt="coffeecore"></p>
<ul>
<li>The recommended soundtrack for Coffeecore:</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Whether or not you like coffee, <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/2020/05/coffeecore-on-city.html">this story</a> will get you out of the house and sipping iced lattes, cups of black drip, and other delights in your mind.</p>
<h2 id="comics">Comics</h2>
<p>During this copious indoor time, I‚Äôve enjoyed reading quite a few <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/books">books</a>, and a bunch of graphic novels, manga, and comics. Unfortunately, Marvel and a few other publishers decided to pause a number of series like <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/decorum-1">Decorum</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/injection-volume-1/9781632154798">Injection</a>.</p>
<p>If you need a few volumes to read during this pause, I recommend these three:</p>
<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/die-volume-1-fantasy-heartbreaker/9781534312708">Die</a>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/city-1/9781945054785">City</a>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/books?keywords=Dorohedoro">Dorohedoro</a></p>
<p>Also, all the new X-Men Dawn of X/House of X stuff is great as well, but those series are stuck on issue 10 until Marvel sorts out their single distributor issue.</p>
<p>Are you reading anything great? Any old favorite manga or graphic novels I should check out? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Let me know</a>. I hope the coming week is full of small pleasures, and delights. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

<p>In other news, my company has extended our work from home until at least September, which means I‚Äôm going to see so many more movies, and play so much Gran Turismo. I think Snorri will also be stoked to have a human pillow for longer.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been cooking a lot since getting back from Japan, and this week I made a lot of fresh tortillas, which it turns out are <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/simple-tortillas-recipe">very, very easy to make</a>. If you want them to even better, you‚Äôll have to invest in lard.</p>
<p>Had enough tortillas? Here‚Äôs some dessert:</p>

<li>First, here‚Äôs a long video that explores how we ended-up in our precarious economic condition. Spoiler alert: our capitalism isn‚Äôt working:</li>

<li>Perhaps that was a little depressing and long. Have you seen Terrace House? Have you played Animal Crossing? This video was made just for you:</li>

<ul>
<li>More of a sports person? Maybe you‚Äôre into shooting hoops, and the playground is where you <em>spent most of your days</em>. How about a hoop you can‚Äôt miss a shot on?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtN4tkvcBMA&amp;feature=emb_title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtN4tkvcBMA&amp;feature=emb_title</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling upbeat? Enjoying the vibe? I am too, which is why I plan to enjoy it, take care of the planet, and <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/may-we-live-long-and-die-out-6d8688a4b0a3">die without children</a>. I can‚Äôt say that I necessarily prescribe to this philosophy, but for various reasons I plan to enjoy my life with my friends and pets, and then leave the world better off than I found it, hopefully.</li>
<li>Paul Ford wrote a lovely piece about what we can <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stones-clocks-what-we-should-actually-leave-behind/">leave behind as a society</a> that might actually stand the test of time. Folks are a bit maudlin these days, but I‚Äôll be damned if they‚Äôre not writing really incredible essays.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs almost May, can you believe it? This spring is flying by, despite being mostly confined to my apartment. On Saturday a bunch of dinguses at my apartment decided to have a party, with more than 10 people just laughing it up in the courtyard, and I just don‚Äôt get it. I know it sucks for a lot of folks to be alone right now, but for fuck‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt have a party! Are you doing with this quarantine ok? Finding anything fun to do? Making great food? Angry about your careless neighbors? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a>. Stay safe, and I‚Äôll talk to you next week space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>This week marked my first sourdough loaves, which were delicious and a bit flat. It turns out having a scale is crucial, and hopefully next week I will get to address that lack.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>This week marked my first sourdough loaves, which were delicious and a bit flat. It turns out having a scale is crucial, and hopefully next week I will get to address that lack. I also got a few of my hobby shipments in, which meant building a tiny Porsche and beginning a small robot. Being stuck indoors all day alone is a great excuse for rediscovering things I enjoyed when I was a weird shut-in kid. I feel super lucky most of my hobbies involve being alone indoors, save for driving, which I also enjoyed this weekend in an undisclosed touge road.</p>
<p>How‚Äôs your week? I hope you too have been finding hobbies to tide you over, and tv shows to binge. I‚Äôm back on my Terrace House habit again, mostly so I can co-watch with friends (hi Mehan and Soleil). It‚Äôs sad knowing the filming is paused due to the pandemic, but hopefully one day we‚Äôll get new episodes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all I can give you is a few links a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if you want to follow in my LEGO footsteps, you might enjoy <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/speed-champions">these little cars</a>. They‚Äôre pretty quick to put together and showed me how far sets have come since I was a kid.</li>
<li>What makes <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/how-did-x-become-the-most-edgy-letter">the letter ‚ÄòX‚Äô so horny</a>? That‚Äôs right, we went from LEGO to the horniest bit of the alphabet. The history is rather religious, and somewhat surprising. Let‚Äôs not forget about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_X_syndrome">triple-x syndrome</a> or the most important XXX of all time:</li>
</ul>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<ul>
<li>If you‚Äôre my age, you likely remember when we were banned from citing the internet in papers, especially the dreaded online encyclopedia <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-online-encyclopedia-best-place-internet/">Wikipedia</a>. Fortunately, it kept getting better, and is now a fantastic place to learn a bit and find primary and secondary sources for all sorts of wild stuff. I‚Äôve had friends engaged in edit wars over famous trans video game characters, and many other topics. If you‚Äôve never had the chance to go down a Wikihole, I recommend you just start clicking inside of articles, and don‚Äôt stop till you get hungry. It‚Äôs a fun maze to lose yourself in.</li>
<li>This week I learned about two important memes: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/russian-butt-slapping-championship">Russian Butt Slapping</a>, and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slapping-bags-of-soil">Soil Slapping</a>. It turns out you can slap a lot of things, but butts and soil are probably the best. I hope one day we can all slap someone‚Äôs butt competitively again.</li>
<li>Remember <a href="http://sidetalkin.com/">Sidetalkin‚Äô</a>? <a href="https://overcast.fm/+W3OaQhh3s">Panic sure does</a>. The nineties were so weird.</li>
<li>Finally, here‚Äôs a short story about <a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_11_15/">cooking during a pandemic</a>. It was written way before this whole think kicked off, and was eerily prescient.</li>
</ul>
<p>How&rsquo;re you keeping busy? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> and let me know! This weekend I&rsquo;ll make more tortillas, watch more Terrace House, and finish building my small robot.</p>

      <description>Welcome to your weekly installment of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs Brook reading and clicking on now?‚Äù The quarantine here in the Bay Area is 4 weeks on, I think, and today I briefly saw a friend outside while dropping off groceries.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Welcome to your weekly installment of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs Brook reading and clicking on now?‚Äù The quarantine here in the Bay Area is 4 weeks on, I think, and today I briefly saw a friend outside while dropping off groceries. It was nice. I hope you‚Äôve had some distant human contact this month too. I‚Äôve also been buying wine from Ordinaire, along with various tinned fishes, because this shit sucks, but wine and mackerel are delightful.</p>
<p>Also delightful? <em>Detroiters</em>‚Äîa show about a small Detroit advertising firm by Tim Robinson, also know for <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>. I‚Äôm savoring this show, but tonight I watched an absurd episode that was all about riding that hog.</p>
<p>I found out last week after a few somewhat failed photo links that my setup blocks ‚Äúhot links‚Äù, something that one reader (hi Drew) commented on with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúlol, wild that that‚Äôs enabled by default? Is hotlinking still an internet crime in 2020?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hereby swear to avoid hot linking, unless it‚Äôs a lovely chorizo.</p>
<p>Ok, let‚Äôs get down to it: here‚Äôs the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I often find myself with little chunks of text, links or errata that I need to store temporarily, or add too here and there. Luckily, there&rsquo;s now <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps-were-trying-tot/">an app for that named Tot</a>. It&rsquo;s not a notes app, per se, but more like ephemeral sticky notes. I created a global shortcut, so I can always throw things into Tot, and sharing it out, or copying it elsewhere is super simple. If you work with strings, links, or junk, this is a great app. I haven&rsquo;t put it on my phone at this point, but I also feel less need to store things that way on iOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of random junk, do you find outdoor advertisement to be annoying? In my opinion outdoor ads are the shitty banner ads of the real world, and I wish they didn&rsquo;t exist. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/the-growing-global-movement-to-end">a global movement to ban them</a>, and I really hope somehow they succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week I spent some time thinking about <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54202/weird-history-pogs">Pogs</a>, those little milk-caps that folks who&rsquo;re in their mid-30s fell in love with as kids. It turns out their history is more complicated than I thought, but I&rsquo;m still unable to find out if there was a regulation slammer size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief plug for very good coffee that shows up in your mailbox: <a href="https://www.yesplz.coffee">YesPlz</a>. I have consistently enjoyed this stuff ever since my old boss (hi David) turned me on to them. The beans come from a guy named Tonx, who previously ran a coffee service with the same name. Previously I bought Ethiopian beans from Four Barrel or Sightglass, but YesPlz has taken over as my only coffee supplier, especially during this pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re hopped-up on caffeine, time to do <a href="https://howlowcanyourlogo.com">some terrible work</a>. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s a competition to make a shitty logo. I&rsquo;ve done a few of these in the past, and I really, really love making nightmarish designs. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week&rsquo;s long read is about my favorite Swedish-speaking Finnish lesbian cartoonist, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/inside-tove-janssons-private-universe">Tove Jansson</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t ever read Moomin, I highly <a href="https://shop.moomin.com/collections/books/books-books-in-english">recommend it</a>. There are tv shows as well. Often overlooked, but a real treat, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Play_(novel)">her novels</a>.„ÄÄI&rsquo;m also low-key fascinated by how obsessed Japan is with Moomin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s given you a few weird places to play online for the next week. How&rsquo;re you doing? Are you up to anything cool or fun? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> and say hi if you feel like it. As always, stay healthy and happy‚Äîsee you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>This week I spent some time thinking about hoarding.
Specifically, toilet paper hoarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to venture out this week to the grocery, but the TP situation in my house is on its way to dire.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>This week I spent some time thinking about hoarding.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/cool.jpeg" alt="cool hoarders"></p>
<p>Specifically, toilet paper hoarding. I&rsquo;ve yet to venture out this week to the grocery, but the TP situation in my house is on its way to dire. I was able to procure <em>napkins</em> a week ago, so&hellip; needs must.</p>
<p>The only hoarding I&rsquo;ve managed to do, back when it was just called &ldquo;collecting&rdquo; was of alcohol. I&rsquo;m a little proud of my strange Shochu collection, largely enabled by my friends over at <a href="https://umamimart.com">Umami Mart</a> (who&rsquo;re still doing curbside pickup in the East Bay, btw).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/shochucollection.jpeg" alt="shochu collection"></p>
<p>As you can tell from the photo, I&rsquo;m prepared. You can also tell that Snorri is quite glad I&rsquo;m constantly around right now, since he gets a 24/7 warm body to sleep on, and climb on. He&rsquo;s only demanded things a few times.</p>
<p>Much of this quarantine has felt similar to my normal life, albeit with a touch more agoraphobia than usual. I spent a lot of time when I wasn&rsquo;t at work sitting at home in the <em>before times</em> and I&rsquo;m fortunate it&rsquo;s to my liking. I guess I miss seeing people occasionally, or going to restaurants a little, but we&rsquo;ll see if even I hit my limit. I spent around 4 years leaving my house minimally when I lived in Portland, and now I also have the aid of a therapist and medicine, so.</p>
<p>If your situation is different or tougher, I send you my love and a 6m distant hug. I know a few folks who&rsquo;re sick right now, and I hope they heal up again quick.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re online a lot right now to distract and entertain yourself, so I will do what I can to add some levity. Here&rsquo;s the links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can you <em>believe</em> it&rsquo;s been 30 years since <a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/pages/search-results-page?collection=shadowrun&amp;page=1&amp;rb_product_type=Rulebooks">Shadowrun</a> first launched? Frankly, I&rsquo;m a little shocked. This is a bit like those &ldquo;Nevermind came out longer ago from now than Led Zepplin&rsquo;s II&rdquo; for me. I&rsquo;ve only played a handful of games in those 30 years, because it seems hard to convince folks <em>not</em> to play D&amp;D, but I spent hours and hours reading the second-edition sourcebooks when I was a kid. Yes, I was the kind of child that read RPG sourcebooks alone. I still do.</li>
<li>Keeping things in the <em>past</em> I present to you an <a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch">emulator of the original NEXT browser</a> brought to my attention by <a href="www.craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> during a private live-streamed design of a website he did yesterday. I think it&rsquo;s a bit cool how many folks have started ambient live-streams of various activities. It feels like a very low-key way to hang out with people.</li>
<li>Another blast from the past‚Äîwow this week‚Äîis You Look Nice Today. They&rsquo;ve <em>returned</em> with <a href="https://www.californiaking.org">California King</a> and have stayed funny and delightful. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d seen much of Scott since the old days of YLNT, but I&rsquo;m always down for <em>yet another</em> Merlin man joint. If you decide to listen to the archives of YLNT, perhaps keep in mind that they&rsquo;ve grown a bit as people, and you might hear some less than ideal content in the old ones. Que sera sera.</li>
<li>During a foraging session, I managed to buy some whole wheat starter, but no yeast. No matter, I&rsquo;ve begun to make a <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/">starter</a>. This feels a little prairie home for me, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to <em>more bread</em> because going out to buy fresh baguette every few days is not a good quarantine habit, I&rsquo;ve found. I&rsquo;ll report back on the bread in the future.</li>
<li>Finally, I share with you a regular &lsquo;ol blog from <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/">a few writers similarly stuck into their homes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to those of you who&rsquo;ve emailed me in the past few weeks to chat or comment on the email! I really love reading stuff from y&rsquo;all, and will try to reply back most of the time. I know folks who&rsquo;ve subscribed are a bit scattered around the globe, so it&rsquo;s nice to get the chance to catch-up through the asynchronous magic of email and RSS. If any of you keep a blog or have a newsletter, definitely let me know. I&rsquo;m logging off for now to go watch the second season of Ozark and whittle down a bit of that shochu collection. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Ah, I‚Äôve returned to the Americas. This week, Japan started quarantining as well, so I just missed the cutoff there and was largely able to enjoy wandering around like usual. I still tried to socially distance while I was in Tokyo and Osaka however, and I even <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">blogged about it</a> in five parts. Overall, it was a strange trip, but a fun one. I hope I get to travel back to Japan again in November after the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-social-distancing-over-back-to-normal/608752/">quarantine ends</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you‚Äôve been enjoying your time at home, with your loved ones and pets, or if you‚Äôre still going in to work, thank you for helping take care of the rest of us. I went grocery shopping today, and everyone was thanking the employees for their service the whole time, which was nice to hear. I sincerely hope this whole thing leads us to believing in socialized medicine for everyone, because this most certainly won‚Äôt be the only medical crisis we face in the next 50 years. Hopefully if you‚Äôre reading this, you also agree.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that you‚Äôre stuck at home, maybe you can try <a href="https://www.flowbee.com/Questions.htm">cutting your own hair</a>. My entire childhood included haircuts from my dad in the garage with one of <a href="https://haircut.com/products/clear-model-by-robocut-1040-w-power">these</a>. I hated the sound of the shopvac, but I suppose it saved us money as a family. We were definitely style innovators in the 90s.</li>
<li>Jenny wrote this essay before the quarantine, but it‚Äôs certainly more true now than ever that we‚Äôre <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/01/15/the-myth-of-self-reliance/">unable to be self-reliant</a>. We‚Äôre all in this together, it turns out.</li>

</div>

<ul>
<li>I write most things these days on an iPad, and the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro/">2020 iPad Pros just launched</a>. Whether I‚Äôm traveling, or sitting at home with my iPad plugged in to a monitor, it‚Äôs an amazing computer. With the launch of iOS 13.4, Apple reinvented the mouse cursor in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-trackpad-cursor/">whole new, fun way</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ipad_home.jpg" alt="my iPad at home"></p>
<ul>
<li>While I‚Äôm at home, I‚Äôm rediscovering some nerdy teen hobbies, like <a href="https://newtypehq.com/products/hg-msz-006a1-zeta-plus-unicorn-ver?variant=14548538327089#">Gunpla</a>. Despite a #gunpla channel at work, I‚Äôd resisted the siren song of plastic models until I faced the prospect of months alone at my apartment. I‚Äôm kind of excited to have some time to really devote to reading and making tiny robots.</li>
<li>I‚Äôve got a big queue of books to get through, and this week I‚Äôm enjoying the sci-fi <a href="https://www.maxgladstone.com/writing/empress-of-forever/">tale of a lesbian tech CEO</a> which I‚Äôm reading along with my book club. It‚Äôs a fun romp through space with a strange cast of characters.</li>
<li>Finally, do you miss folks laughing at your jokes at work? No fear! You can <a href="https://www.myinstants.com/instant/laugh-track/">summon laughter at will with this button</a>. There‚Äôs also <a href="http://www.instantrapairhorn.com">an instant rap air horn</a>, naturally.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs scary out there, so I hope you‚Äôre staying safe and managed to find some toilet paper amidst the bizarre hoarding. It‚Äôs too bad more bathrooms here don‚Äôt have <a href="https://washlet.totousa.com">washlets</a>. Maybe you‚Äôre watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acTdxsoa428">Tiger King</a>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/03/coronavirus-trolls-world-tour-invisible-man-the-hunt-emma-debut-on-demand-in-home-theatrical-window-collapse-1202884570/">hoping more films go straight to Netflix or Apple TV</a>, or just collecting as many bells as you can to pay off that bastard Tom Nook‚Äîhowever you spend your week, keep washing your hands, and checking in with your loved ones. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>Hello from a 200mph Nozomi Shinaksen train on my way to Tokyo! This train still feels like the future, and it‚Äôs especially wild that people are riding it and no one seems particularly worried.</p>
<p>Onomichi‚Äîwhere I was for the past few days‚Äîwas gorgeous! Truly in rare form. If you‚Äôd like to read about that and see some photos of my hiking and exploring, you know <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/">where to go</a>.</p>
<p>I spent <em>four hours</em> on the phone today with Chase bank trying to move my flight forward a few days to try to ensure that I won‚Äôt be trapped outside of California. Were it not for Snorri, I might consider trying to just work and hide out in Japan during this pandemic, but for both him and my work, it‚Äôs probably good to head home. Knock on some wood for me, or send good travel vibes‚Äîwhatever your method of magic may be.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre probably not here to read about my Japanese vacation travails though, so without further ado, here‚Äôs the links:</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/davdchristmas/status/1239196410857340933">https://mobile.twitter.com/davdchristmas/status/1239196410857340933</a></p>
<ul>
<li>You might know that I‚Äôm a racing fan, and especially love Formula 1 racing, but currently all the races this season are cancelled. Bummer. To get my high-octane thrill, I‚Äôve resorted to watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3hEfwmzgDI">matchbox cars</a> thanks to my friend Stephan, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1cFm3dsaU">sim racing with actual F1 drivers</a>. YouTube is often a shitshow of terrible videos, but this week it‚Äôs a true savior with all of its odd niches. Maybe you‚Äôll find a cool substitute for something you miss on there as well.</li>
<li>A few weeks ago, when we could still <em>gather</em>, I saw Kyle Chayka and Robin Sloan discuss Kyle‚Äôs new book. It was pretty fun, albeit sparsely attended. If you haven‚Äôt read <em>Longing for Less</em>, perhaps this will <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/03/the-pitfalls-and-the-potential-of-the-new-minimalism">convince you to pick up a a copy</a> from an independent bookstore. Robin even recommends a few other books in <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletter/march-2020/">his latest newsletter</a>.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm fascinated with the idea of <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/but-and/">‚Äúbut/and‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll catch on, but/and it‚Äôs cool.</li>
<li>Do you love museums? Do you love cats? <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cats-sneaking-security-ken-chan-gosaku-hiroshima-onomichi-city-museum-of-art/">Then you‚Äôre in luck</a>!</li>

<li>Are you as amped about Animal Crossing: New Horizon as I am? Make sure you‚Äôre prepared if you plan to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185977/animal-crossing-new-horizons-local-multiplayer-island-sharing">share your island with your family</a>. There are benefits, but as a woman who lives alone, I certainly would prefer to keep my island of Lesbos to myself. Reply to this email if you want my friend code though :D</li>
</ul>
<p>The train is about to pull into the station in Tokyo, and then I‚Äôll hop onto the metro line to Asakusa. Drop me a line and tell me something you‚Äôve loved this week. I‚Äôll share some good things again next week if you‚Äôd like me to pass them along. And as always, wash your hands and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Welcome to a new world without toilet paper. Seriously, it‚Äôs fucking depressing seeing pictures of grocery stores post-hoarding. I hope everyone reading this cares for your fellow humans more than building a fort out of sanitizer and toilet paper.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Welcome to a new world without toilet paper. Seriously, it‚Äôs fucking depressing seeing pictures of grocery stores post-hoarding. I hope everyone reading this cares for your fellow humans more than building a fort out of sanitizer and toilet paper.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a cat to help you feel better:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/artgillespie/status/1238266163294957568?s=20">https://twitter.com/artgillespie/status/1238266163294957568?s=20</a></p>
<p>Sorry for starting on a bummer note, but it‚Äôs kinda wild out there, eh?
I hope you‚Äôre taking care of yourself, washing your hands for 20 seconds, using lotion to protect your skin, and breathing deeply. In this midst of the wild times, I bring you links and love from a train in Japan traveling 200 miles per hour. Everyone is wearing masks, and it‚Äôs gently raining outside of the window as we pass Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Ok, here‚Äôs the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>It turns out, on some sites it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.cjr.org/first_person/the-infinite-scroll.php">ads all the way down</a>. I personally use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bltoTMJZetc">an adblocker</a> for many, many reasons. It really helps with page load times too. If you‚Äôre feeling fancy, you can <a href="https://pi-hole.net">install one on your router</a>, or use something like an Eero that can handle blocking for you with no installation.</li>
<li>This piece was written <a href="https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2020/01/08/i-think-you-should-leave/">for our current world</a> about the Netflix show <em>I Think You Should Leave</em> and using Tim Robinson‚Äôs absurdist comedy to cope with dread. I loved this show, and have watched it more than once at this point. If you like it, I also recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMW-SzZKJ-Q"><em>Nathan for You</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2dSE6_utcE"><em>Review</em></a>, both of which are equally strange and oddly comforting. I know for some of you reading this, your empathy extends to fictional characters on tv, and makes watching ‚Äúcringe‚Äù shows essentially impossible, but if you are like me, and enjoy some good old-fashioned schadenfreude&hellip; ‚ÄúAbsurdist humor is a means to express the core disillusionment that lies at the heart of the millennial generation‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/i-think-you-should-leave2-e1578519100351.jpg" alt="no good car ideas"></p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/12/814414450/comic-i-spent-a-day-in-coronavirus-awareness-mode-epidemiologists-how-did-i-do">comic about trying really, really hard not to touch your face</a>. I always think ‚Äúhot hands!‚Äù which helps a little. A habit I picked up from conferences, which are always hotbeds of illness, is to never touch my face or food until I‚Äôve washed thoroughly. It even helps to wash during ‚Äútransitions,‚Äù like, getting home, going to the restroom, etc. Soap: it‚Äôs really good.</li>
<li>This link might be a little odd considering we‚Äôre all working from home indefinitely, but here‚Äôs a bit about how folks are using mute and noise-cancelling to <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/hit-the-mute-button-why-everyone-is-trying-to-silence-the-outside-world">escape the world around them</a>.</li>
<li>Today, I‚Äôm off to Kyoto, which is trying to attract tourists currently through an <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/travel/Kyoto-starts-new-%27Empty%27-tourism-campaign-to-attract-tourists-during-coronavirus-outbreak">odd campaign</a>. I‚Äôm only there for one night, to enjoy a hotel room designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamantaka_Eye">EY„É®</a>. It promises to be an interesting experience. Hopefully I‚Äôll have photos to share with you next week. Here‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUSGujidgns">one of my favorite albums by Boredoms</a>, the band that „Ç¢„Ç§ started.</li>
<li>Finally, for you documentation nerds out there, I think this is a pretty interesting solution for folks who like <a href="https://hackmd.io/">using Github and Markdown to write</a>. It‚Äôs not particularly mobile-friendly, but theoretically one could edit and write in a markdown tool of choice, then use this app to do the collaboration bits. I still don‚Äôt really like Google Docs, and I fear for the future of Dropbox Paper, so I‚Äôm glad to see more work on open standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs it from me today in Êó•Êú¨. I hope your Saturday is quiet and relaxing, and you‚Äôre able to have a great big belly laugh every day this week. Love yourself, and those around you, and as always‚Äîsee you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>This email comes to you from a rainy port city, where I am spending time on strategy and vision for the Women‚Äôs Foundation of Oregon. Spending the weekend with a room full of amazing women from all over the state comprising our board was incredible. My heart is full, and I‚Äôm hopeful for the work we can accomplish in the coming years.</p>
<p>Next week I‚Äôll be in yet another city on the other side of the globe, and despite the prevalent fear of disease right now, I‚Äôm excited to be on the road again, testing my travel packing and gear.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre also traveling, or spending some time working from home this week, here are some links to keep you curious:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the topic of travel, did you know that scientists can‚Äôt agree on <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/">how planes stay in the air</a>? There are theories that mostly work, but all of them are missing some part. Honestly, it‚Äôs probably just an aeromancer on each plane.</li>
<li>Remember Fraidycat from last week? Robin wrote a bit more about how <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/master-tapes/">he‚Äôs enjoying it</a>, and how the creator of the site just wants to be left alone.</li>
<li>Here‚Äôs a heartening tale of a company that raised their <a href="https://kottke.org/20/02/what-happened-to-the-company-that-raised-minimum-wage-to-70kyr">minimum wage to 70k a year</a>. A lot of folks wanted them to fail, and thereby prove that the system works better when some people live in poverty, but it turned out folks do better work when they‚Äôre less stressed about money. I mean, c‚Äômon.</li>
<li>Do you like books? Do you like arbitrary tournaments? Boom, here‚Äôs <a href="https://themorningnews.org/tob/2020/golden-state-v-oval-v-we-cast-a-shadow.php">both at once</a>. I love these silly march-madness-esque book-offs. I‚Äôve only read a few books on this list, so I can‚Äôt wait to read more. Hopefully this tournament adds a few items to your to-read list too.</li>
<li>Speaking of good books, I‚Äôm loving <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8756/q-and-a-joanne-mcneil-lurking-book-how-person-became-user">Lurking</a>, which outlines the growth of the social web, and how people became <em>users</em>. I remember many of the events in this book very well, and Joanne interviewed folks that I know to write it, so it hit me at home. I usually don‚Äôt like non-fiction, Lurking moves through ideas in such an entertaining fashion that I forgot my preference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I saw cherry blossoms all over the city, and it got me excited for the new season! Japan traditionally has 24 seasons, and we just entered ÂïìËüÑ which is when all the little critters crawl out to celebrate and move about. Personally, I‚Äôm very excited to be one of the animals exploring the world during this season, dutifully avoiding crowds. As I saw someone say online last week: ‚ÄúAvoiding crowds? I‚Äôve been preparing for this my entire life.‚Äù Jokes aside, I hope you and yours stay safe and happy during what is a scary time. And as always, see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>This weekend is a bit sad, as it would have marked my countdown to a two week vacation in Japan, but due to coronavirus I had to cancel the trip.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>This weekend is a bit sad, as it would have marked my countdown to a two week vacation in Japan, but due to coronavirus I had to cancel the trip. Perhaps I‚Äôll do something else, but right now I‚Äôm just worried for my friends and coworkers abroad and at home. Keep your hands washed, your spirits up, and your days full of love.</p>
<p>I did plan a second trip this year in November for the amazing <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com/collections/retreats/products/focus-yoshino-retreat-2020-apply">Focus retreat put on by Craig Mod</a>. If you‚Äôre reading this, you might enjoy it, so I recommend <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com/collections/retreats/products/focus-yoshino-retreat-2020-apply">applying</a>.</p>
<p>Snorri is currently sitting on my shoulder, and I‚Äôm taking his plaintive cries as a, ‚Äúget to the links!‚Äù so I will:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/036/">This is a wide-ranging newsletter installment</a> from one of my favorite newsletter writers recently. I particularly enjoyed this quote about developing our ideas and giving them real space:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If an idea is any good, chances are you shouldn‚Äôt just be tweeting it, but rather giving it a more solid, fleshed out form as a blog post or essay or zine or whatever. This is out of respect for the idea itself. What I find most dangerous about Twitter is that it can generate similar chemical feelings to having done ‚Äúthe work,‚Äù when in fact, you haven‚Äôt done the work. You‚Äôve just micro-plastic‚Äôd idea potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There are so many ways to delete your tweets. I like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jumbo-privacy-security/id1454039975">Jumbo</a>, but perhaps you‚Äôre <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2/">into</a>  <a href="https://gist.github.com/robinsloan/3688616">scripts</a> or just want to artisanally <a href="https://micahflee.com/2019/06/semiphemeral-automatically-delete-your-old-tweets-except-for-the-ones-you-want-to-keep/">prune</a>. Take this opportunity, if you want, to <a href="https://tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me/">unfollow people</a> who no longer bring you joy. I‚Äôm still off of Twitter and I think it might just stick.</li>
<li>If you‚Äôve been on the internet your whole life, or even just a lot of the adult parts, you perhaps carry shame from something you did or said. <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/emily-gould-gawker-shame.html">Emily Gould tackles hers from her time at Gawker</a>.</li>
<li>Chances are, you‚Äôve worked in an open-plan office during your career. It <em>turns out</em> these are just about the <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/its-official-open-plan-offices-are-now-dumbest-management-fad-of-all-time.html">worst idea since Six Sigma</a> or trust falls. I don‚Äôt think cubicles are the solution either, but what if at some point we could have offices again?</li>
<li>Do you love cool women and skateboarding? Yea, me too! You might <a href="https://www.oh-so.co/shop">dig this magazine</a> in that case. Personally, I‚Äôve got a serious backlog of <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com">Offscreen</a> and <a href="https://monocle.com">Monocle</a>, so I can‚Äôt quite subscribe right now, but it looks dope.]</li>
<li>I‚Äôm also reading <a href="https://www.kylechayka.com/book/">The Longing for Less</a> this weekend, which I got to hear a discussion about between Robin Sloan and the author, Kyle Chayka this week at the cute <a href="https://www.booksinc.net/SFOpera">Opera Plaza Books Inc</a>. If you‚Äôve been around minimalism at all, or are curious about it, it‚Äôs well worth a read. It‚Äôs a critical survey and personal journey through music, writing, architecture, and hellish instagram minimalism.</li>
<li>Finally, I hope you get a chance to <em><a href="https://www.eattheball.com/">eat the ball</a></em>. Eat. The. Ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this deluge of links gives you something nice to read and explore as you take time for yourself this week. The times may be scary, but there are so many neat people and things around too, and I am personally trying to stay focused on that. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>This was the week I left Twitter for a while. Honestly it wasn‚Äôt so bad, once I got over the twitchy ‚Äúgotta open Twitter‚Äù feeling. I‚Äôll write more about that experience soon, with some light suggested reading and a few tips. My main takeaway so far is that I spent a lot of time opening and closing and reopening Twitter for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I would‚Äôve sent:</p>
<h2 id="tweets-that-werent">Tweets that weren‚Äôt</h2>
<p>I really love high fidelity but I can‚Äôt quite get behind the idea that Zoe kravitz‚Äô character doesn‚Äôt know how gorgeous she is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, I want an election!&rdquo; Except Bloomberg is the daddy and the child in this situation.</p>
<p>I love watching Tortoise play!

</div>
</p>
<p>Woke up like this:</p>
<p>You‚Äôre probably here for the links though, aren‚Äôt you?</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/alexis-pereira-viral-essay-twitter-joke-diary.html">This is what happens</a> when you succeed at tweeting something funny.</li>
<li>Last month I joined quite a lot of folks in the Bay Area in <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/culture-anna-wiener-uncanny-valley-review/">reading Anna Weiner‚Äôs Uncanny Valley</a>. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an incredible tell-all, but it was certainly entertaining.</li>
<li>What is porn like for folks who can‚Äôt see? <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/02/pornhub-audio-description-interview-accessibility.html">This interview</a> is fairly revealing.</li>
<li>Were you ever broke? How about poor? There‚Äôs a pretty big difference, and <a href="https://longreads.com/2018/06/12/the-difference-between-being-broke-and-being-poor/">this comic</a> helps illustrate what it looks like at the grocery store.</li>
<li>Finally, if you‚Äôve ever had the delight of shopping at Berkeley Bowl, you owe Glenn Yasuda thanks. <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/2/20/21145724/glenn-yasuda-berkeley-bowl-obituary">Let‚Äôs remember him.</a></li>

<p>I‚Äôm all out of links, and off to get my first haircut in the new year. Enjoy your week, and I‚Äôll see you next weekend, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>First of all, look at this DUCK!
https://twitter.com/hartyt_/status/1228149203261698048?s=21
I‚Äôm writing this intro at my dining table, while someone cleans my house.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>First of all, look at this DUCK!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hartyt_/status/1228149203261698048?s=21">https://twitter.com/hartyt_/status/1228149203261698048?s=21</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm writing this intro at my dining table, while someone cleans my house. Hiring a house-cleaner is one of the most awkward and also incredible things I‚Äôve done in the past few years. I learned it‚Äôs a lot cheaper than I thought it would be‚Äîin Portland it cost 60 bucks a session. I haven‚Äôt figured out how to not feel like I‚Äôm in the way the whole time, or how to comfort Snorri, but at least my house is pretty damn clean for a few days.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs cloudy outside today, but I still plan to venture to a pop-up Yakitori thing put on by some pals at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/torimancal/">È≥•‰∏á
</a>. Feeling hungry? Feast on these links:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you ever want to explore the fantastic electronics market of Shenzhen, <a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/essential/essential-guide-shenzhen-web.pdf">this guide is a must read</a>. I&rsquo;ve never been, but I&rsquo;ve heard it handily beats out Akihabara for wacky and delightful electronic goods.</li>
<li>While we&rsquo;re on the topic of China, this Chinese fashion designer blew me away with <a href="https://coolhunting.com/style/penultimates-dazzling-diy-influenced-collection/">this collection</a>. I love the utterly bizarre combination of patterns and body-horror.</li>
<li>You probably saw this online this week, but this guy&rsquo;s daughter rocked the world with the creation of <a href="https://twitter.com/craigcalcaterra/status/1227594895747141632?s=12">long Chile and Ohio 2</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, you don‚Äôt know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg4Dyx3XXDg">about squeakin‚Äô?</a>?!</li>
<li>If you‚Äôve ever talked to a person in tech, you may have heard, ‚Äúyou should learn to code. This refrain sometimes come from a good place, but also feels like ‚Äúhey dumdum, just make a software!‚Äù I really like the way that Robin Sloan reframed it this week as: ‚Äúlearn to be a home cook‚Äù. We usually don‚Äôt learn how to cook so we can open a Michelin-started restaurant, but instead so we can feed ourselves. <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">What does this look like when the oven is computers?</a></li>
<li>If you‚Äôre a podcast fan, perhaps some of the shows you love are celebrating ten years of recording. One of my favorites is the extremely nerdy <a href="https://overcast.fm/+kMZLu2m8">The Incomparables</a>. Every episode is a discussion of comics, movies, books, or something equally nerdy. There are lots of drafts, and I have genuinely enjoyed laughing along with them since 2010. MBMBAM will also hit 500 soon. Feeling a little old, lol.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoyed today&rsquo;s whirlwind tour of <em>links</em>. The cleaning is still going on here near the IKEA, and I&rsquo;m getting peckish. Tomorrow is a holiday here, luckily, and I plan to do very little. I hope you have a long weekend too, and tomorrow will be a day of rest and relaxation. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Shochu, CSS, and ‚Äúenough‚Äù

      <content:encoded><p><strong>Shochu, CSS, and ‚Äúenough‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>This week marked the inaugural <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL_ruBAwVmo">Figma conference</a>, which I was able to attend through my employer. It was neat to be surrounded by designers from all over the world, and think about how to solve bigger problems than just ‚Äúhow to make people click‚Äù.</p>
<p>I also got to meet up with <a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/035/">Craig Mod</a> of hiking, ebook, and Leica writing renound‚Äîhe‚Äôs a delight. At a certain point in life I realized most of the people I dig know each other, so it wasn‚Äôt a surprise he knew the <a href="https://waxy.org/">Andys</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hoverbird">Patrick</a>. We got to talk about the realities of living in Japan as a white American, as well as creating our own families outside of the heteronormative frame.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a nice week. How was yours? Reply if you feel like sharing.</p>
<p>And now, the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/">the time before CSS</a>? The simple text-mostly world of blue underlined and tables? This is the internet I cut my teeth on, and learned how to code into.</li>
<li>In the world of tech and productivity, everyone is pushing harder and harder to get more done. What if instead of efficiency, we looked <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/energy-efficiency/forget-efficiency-it-time-get-serious-about-sufficiency.html">towards <em>sufficiency</em></a>?</li>
<li>On the same note, this article is a meditation on <a href="https://pjrvs.com/enough">having enough</a>.</li>
<li>If you‚Äôve been outside in the states at all, you‚Äôve likely noticed the preponderance of huge, lumbering SUVs in the past two decades. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7q7eb/electric-or-not-big-suvs-are-inherently-selfish">Vice dug into why they exist</a>, and I have a feeling you won‚Äôt be surprised much by who drives them.</li>
<li>Need something to watch? This week I saw <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80187302">The Stranger</a> on Netflix, with Richard Armitage from a very good season of Spooks, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/07/apple-tv-plus-mythic-quest-now-available/">Mystic Quest: Raven‚Äôs Banquet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not you‚Äôre celebrating the annual chocolate and mistake-a-thon that Valentine‚Äôs Day is, I hope you treat yourself to something nice to drink or eat. See you next week space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>A fiscal happy new year to you! I still don&amp;rsquo;t really understand how fiscal years work, but in addition to a lunar new year, Snorri and I celebrated the beginning of FY21, and the 6th anniversary of my employer this weekend.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>A fiscal happy new year to you! I still don&rsquo;t really understand how fiscal years work, but in addition to a lunar new year, Snorri and I celebrated the beginning of FY21, and the 6th anniversary of my employer this weekend. Thrills and chills.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it already feel like spring? Just a little bit? At least in the bay, the plant outside are flowering, and it&rsquo;s already a little warm-is. This is my second year of not really having a winter, and I find the whole thing deeply confusing. On the upside, I never needed to add anything beyond a <a href="https://www.tannergoods.com/products/merino-watch-cap">beanie</a> and a <a href="https://www.parachutehome.com/products/waffle-robe">bathrobe</a> to my wardrobe.</p>
<p>On to the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>The well-regarded Mac and iOS calendar app Fantastical released a somewhat <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/the-new-fantastical-review/">controversial new version</a> this week that adds a ton of great stuff, but also moves to a subscription. I think I&rsquo;ll pay for this, especially because it means I can now create Zoom video links without needing to use Chrome. I&rsquo;d reverted to using the basic calendar app on all my devices until now, but Fantastical 3 adds just enough polish and feature magic to get my cash.</li>
<li>Do you ever think about the future of the internet? <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/before-zuckerberg-gutenberg/603034/">This article from the Atlantic</a> takes lessons from the printing press to assert we&rsquo;re likely wrong. I still think in general there will be a mix of democratizing and open publishing and the horrible continuation of the advertising gristmill.</li>
<li>Frankly, if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113421/soft-robot-hands-sweat-overheating-research">sweaty robots</a> are the future, count me out.</li>
<li>Need a little pick-me-up? Perhaps you&rsquo;d enjoy some <a href="https://tinyspells.xyz">tiny spells</a>.</li>
<li>My friend Casey gave a seminar on writing recently, and luckily for us, she shared <a href="https://caseyplett.wordpress.com/2020/01/31/notes-from-my-seminar-at-usask/">her notes</a>. If you care at all about writing, it&rsquo;s worth a read.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, may your week be filled with the appropriate amount of hydration, rest, and merriment. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><h2 id="redesigns-and-long-reads">redesigns and long reads.</h2>
<p>I got to see William Gibson this week in the city, and listening to his southern drawl discuss the intricacies of stubs and alternate realities. Once I finish <a href="https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/deborah-christian/mainline.htm">Mainline</a>, I can‚Äôt wait to dive into <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/william-gibson-takes-aim-at-the-silicon-valley-he-helped-create-in-an-exclusive-excerpt-of-agency-97c3604fbcde">Agency</a>. Maybe every generation has a real feeling of living in the future, but between tech news and world news, things are a little too reminiscent of sad cyberpunk. This is why I read fiction‚Äîat least there we can have heroes.</p>
<p>And now, the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>No family? If you‚Äôre in Japan, you can <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry">rent one</a>. I wonder if this would save me money on therapy, or leave me even more psychically confused?</li>
<li>Two sites I read have recently gone through a redesign (much like mine), and it‚Äôs fun to see how they <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/gardening-vs-architecture/">thought about it</a>. Even when the site update isn‚Äôt a bit overblown it can be <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/the-great-anifem-makeover-is-here/">very interesting</a>.</li>
<li>In addition to redesigning our personal websites (you started blogging, right? It‚Äôs good for you), perhaps we should find other ways to <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/opinion/world-wide-web.html">fix the web</a></em>.</li>
<li>One friend who blogs blessed us this week with a survey of the <a href="https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/579803.html">feral cats of their neighborhood</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, here‚Äôs <a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/essays/my-instagram/">a longer read about Instagram</a>. More than a few friends consider Instagram to be their nice, chill place online‚Äîa place for soothing images and creativity. I wish it had stayed that way for me, but alas, between ads, and folks aiming to take the exact same photo or get <em>really stoked</em> on exercise, I found it uncomfortable at best. For me, Slack is largely the place I see friend‚Äôs photos. I hope that at some point a non FB company will try to solve the friends + friends of friends photo sharing problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year I decided to upgrade my coffee at home a bit more than before, and my latest acquisition is all about <a href="https://www.hario.jp/seihin/productdetail.php?product=XGS-60TB">drinking coffee by the window</a> and reading books. Prior to this coffee server, I would drip directly into a Zojirushi vacuum thermos, but I prefer the look at ease of carrying that this brings. It‚Äôs never a bad idea to add a little class to one‚Äôs weekend, I think. On that note, I would encourage you to take a few deep breaths, and think about simple ways you can make your days off even more relaxing and delightful.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Sunday, and I‚Äôll see you next week space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>January is nearly over! I had a delicious meal last night of pork cartilage soup (Ë±öËªüÈ™®Ê±Å) and dug into an old classic sci-fi book on recommendation from Robin Sloan‚Äôs newsletter.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>January is nearly over! I had a delicious meal last night of pork cartilage soup (Ë±öËªüÈ™®Ê±Å) and dug into an <a href="https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/deborah-christian/mainline.htm">old classic sci-fi book</a> on recommendation from Robin Sloan‚Äôs newsletter. It‚Äôs weird and fun so far. I also started back at the gym last week, which left me hobbling around as my body complains about all the rowing I did. At least it‚Äôs next to my office!</p>
<p>Enough about that, here‚Äôs more links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throw on the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-knows/1479120003?i=1479120009">new Alice Boman</a> while you read, or even after, on a long walk.</li>
<li>Anne Helen of burnout fame wrote elegantly this week about how we manage to <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-wages-of-productivity">always be working, and never actually resting</a>.</li>
<li>Feel inspired to waste some time? This week I learned you can subscribe to the <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/01/16/youtube-rss-feeds/">RSS feed of videos on YouTube</a> instead of bothering with YouTube‚Äôs terrible interface.</li>
<li>Maybe we should start thinking <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/01/06/circular-time-vs-linear-time/">more about seasons and less about years</a>. I‚Äôm really enjoying this winter, partially because I‚Äôm trying to embrace the good things about it.</li>
<li>Remember Yo? Perhaps there was <a href="https://laughingkaiju.com/yo-really/">something good there</a> after all.</li>
<li>A cool cartoon with a mean gauged-ear <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/8/21057255/infinity-train-book-2-new-episodes-tulip-jesse-mt-mystery">queer-coded protagonist</a>? Sign me up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it‚Äôs time for me to head back into my 80s sci-fi world before going to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering_with_You">Weathering with You</a>. Have a great week, and I hope you spend your MLK Jr. day thinking about ways to enact anti-racism in your daily life.</p>

      <description>We‚Äôre halfway through with the first month of 2020, and the sun has been out a lot this week in the bay.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>We‚Äôre halfway through with the first month of 2020, and the sun has been out a lot this week in the bay. Luckily, I got some new sunglasses so I‚Äôm feeling great about the whole thing.</p>
<p>Have you already mastered all of your New Year‚Äôs resolutions? Mine was the same as it is every year: ‚Äúdo more of what you love and less of what you hate‚Äù. So far, so good.</p>
<p>One of the things I love is writing, so I‚Äôll keep on doing it. Another is the television program <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-09-rewatching-halt-catch-fire/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which I wrote about so that I could combine pleasures. If only I‚Äôd managed to eat prosciutto while writing, I would‚Äôve likely passed out from delight.</p>
<p>Two new things I‚Äôm trying this year: going to the gym next to my office, and washing my face. I was a big powerlifter for over a year in Portland, but never found my rhythm here in the bay due to a weird commute. Fortunately, the gym next to my office seems great for lifting, and since it‚Äôs literally a few feet from the bus home, I think I‚Äôll be able to use it at least a few times a week. Time will tell. As for washing my face? I‚Äôve never really done it, so I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll get out of the whole endeavor, but I‚Äôm <em>aging</em> so I figured no time like the present.</p>
<p>Ok, sorry for the rambling, I know you‚Äôre here for&hellip; the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs chilly out in the northern hemisphere, so perhaps you‚Äôd enjoy a sauna or hot tub dip. If you‚Äôre not quite sold on them yet, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/05/16/sauna-enthusiasm-manga-sadou-steams-up-a-live-action-tv-drama">Sadou</a>, the delightful program about a sauna a lover is really delightful. I‚Äôm not sure if there are subtitles out there yet, but if you can speak Japanese, or just enjoy a show where you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs being said, I highly recommend taking a look.</li>
<li>While we‚Äôre on the topic of Japan, how about a man who bakes <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7571/meet-lord-rod-the-sweet-potato-king-of-yokohama-japan?zd=1&amp;zi=uyn27jjq">sweet potatoes on the back of his custom Miata</a>? My friend Joe writes some truly engaging essays, and this one is especially fun.</li>
<li>If you prefer animated shows, <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/winter-2020-premiere-reviews/">this season of anime</a> is promising, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Eizouken">Eizouken</a>. There are some stinkers too, but hopefully you can avoid those.</li>
<li>Currently I‚Äôm reading a few things, and you might like them. First, a <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/">magazine about life</a> and often about turning things off and going out into the world. Next, a book that teaches you how to <a href="https://jkglei.com/unsubscribe/">get better at time and communication</a>. Finally, I am exploring the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_of_Glass">assassins with Celaena</a> and an assortment of dull men.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully these links keep you warm this week, and you‚Äôre able to find time for yourself and the things you love. Until next week!</p>
<p>See you space cowgirls~</p>

      <content:encoded><p>It‚Äôs 2020! Welcome to the new decade. Imagine for a moment the news hasn‚Äôt already been wild, and step into a this list of joy and edutainment instead. A lot of links this week are to older projects for folks I‚Äôve mentioned before, because I just got back from a long holiday of reading and watching things on tv, so I rediscovered some old favorites. I also redesigned <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">my website</a>, and moved it from Jekyll to Hugo, which meant some painful time with Go templating. Yikes.</p>
<p>Without further ado, release the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>My friend Andy ran another conference before the delightful XOXO, and the talks are still archived for your edification. <a href="https://vimeo.com/63008757">This one from Robin Sloan</a> is a delight. From a different year of build, <a href="https://vimeo.com/33919422">Craig Mod talks about books</a> and their future. 2019 was a banner year for both of their newsletters, and if you haven‚Äôt seen them, here‚Äôs <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/">Craig‚Äôs</a> and here‚Äôs <a href="https://desert.glass">Robin‚Äôs</a>.</li>
<li>If you enjoyed watching Craig Mod‚Äôs talk, and you want to read more, his <a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/">work on ebooks holds up well</a>. As a person who reads every day on a Kindle, I have hope that perhaps the love of text and reading experience will one day fully enter the digital realm. Until then, I‚Äôll keep vacillating between books and ebooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>/Walking.jpeg</p>
<ul>
<li>During the break I picked up a rad re-release of a classic manga called <a href="https://www.greenapplebooks.com/book/9781912097364">‚ÄúThe Walking Man‚Äù</a>, and it‚Äôs both gorgeous and delightfully banal. The book is mostly about a man walking quietly through urban Japan. That‚Äôs it. Sometimes he climbs trees.</li>
<li>During the holiday I also got to spend a lot of time with my friend Julian, who writes <a href="https://maudlinhouse.net/i-am-a-beautiful-bug/">excellent short fiction</a> and a column about <a href="https://entropymag.org/the-care-and-feeding-of-your-sex-change-dan-ortberg-discusses-the-important-matter-of-soup/">gender and food</a>. We ate quite a bit of food, and rang in the new year at a party where everyone wore wigs. A+ would hang out again.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right, thanks for reading along, and being part of my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-30-what-i-learned-from-sending-a-newsletter-this-year/">newsletter journey over this last year</a>. If you‚Äôre still hungry for more newsletter <em>content</em>, I recommend learning about life and birds with <a href="https://tinyletter.com/night_heron">Morgane, the night heron</a>.</p>
<p>See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>
