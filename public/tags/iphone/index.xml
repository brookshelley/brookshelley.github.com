      <description>Another year has rushed past, and with it, another iPhone update and some changes to my phone since last year&#39;s setup. My use of a single screen of apps continues, with a few major and minor changes alongside.
I&#39;ve posted these for the past few years, so if you want to see what apps I was using in 2017, here you go.
Some things change 3 app dock—I moved my Twitter app out of my dock in order to spend less time on Twitter.</description>

      <description>Back to a single screen.
It’s been a year and change since I posted about my iPhone apps and homescreen. I tend to try out new apps pretty often, but now that I use an iPad and an Apple Watch every day, I generally stick with things that support all 3 of my screens well. Some apps have stuck around, but many have been replaced by better (for me) choices. Trying to settle into apps that I use for a long stretch is challenging as businesses fail, or apps stagnate, so here we are.</description>
