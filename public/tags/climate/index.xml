      <description>Due to a series of forest fires, Portland has looked like an alien planet for the past few weeks.

<p>Every day I wake up and google &ldquo;air quality&rdquo; to see just how much I need to stay indoors, next to my air filter. My gym has closed for a few days for two weeks, and walking outside just plain sucks.</p>
<p>The only cool part is the sunsets are ridiculous, and the moon is red at night.</p>
<p>I really hope these fires aren’t an every year occurrence, but I’m not that hopeful, since global warming continues apace. Guess I’ll buy more indoor air filters and a Bane mask.</p>
