<li>2 tablespoons of chili oil (any cooking oil will do though)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>I learned how to make mapo tofu from my first partner’s mom. She let me hang out with her in the kitchen and help, and I got to learn how to make a lot of tasty dishes that I still make regularly. Mapo tofu is probably my favorite, and I make it often. It is easy to prepare, and the leftovers are something I can munch on for 2-3 meals, even if I share a little. It goes super well on rice, or on its own.</p>
<p>Mapo tofu is basically a meat gravy, and as such, it’s ridiculously good. The szechuan peppercorns give your mouth a little extra numb salivation feeling, and the kick from the red chili paste matches the garlic really well. Fresh green onions brighten the dish. This is comfort food for sure.</p>
<p>Making this dish is pretty simple, and if you serve it to someone, there’s a good chance they’ll think you’re a much better cook than you actually are—it’s a great effort-to-result dish.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The recipe</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pour your chili oil into a pan—I use a cast-iron that usually has a little bacon grease in it, so I only add a little chili oil. Turn the heat up to medium- high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As your oil heats up, pour your ground szechuan peppercorns into the pan and heat for a minute or two, along with your ginger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your ground meat into the pan. Cook until lightly browned—around 5 minutes. Stir while you cook to make sure it doesn’t stick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move your pork a little to the side. Pour your chili paste onto the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir a little. You want to get this slightly brown, which takes maybe 2-3 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine the two in the pan, and stir more. Turn the heat down to medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add your soy sauce, and the black bean paste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine your water with your corn starch and dashi powder. Make sure it’s mixed into a smooth tan liquid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the mixture of dashi, starch, and water into the pan, over the pork. Keep stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, the dish should look pretty tasty. It’ll be a reddish brown with ground meat and sauce that’s beginning to thicken a little. Add more water or more corn starch as necessary (always mixing the starch with water outside the pan to prevent clumps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open up your tofu, and cut it 4 or five times long-end to long-end, then once through the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour in the tofu, and break it up a little more with your spatula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir to combine everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a few minutes, the tofu should be heated, and the dish is almost done!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut your green onion into small bits (1-2cm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save a little green onion for presentation. Pour the rest green onion in, and stir to combine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn the heat off, and serve in bowls over rice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some fresh green onion on the top to add a little color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dig in!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Leftovers keep for a few days, but if you like this dish, you’ll have trouble keeping any for longer than a day. In my house, it goes pretty fast.</p>

      <title>Adventures in baking</title>

      <content:encoded><p>Before March I rarely baked. Outside of a few misadventures as a kid, I’d mostly made hand pies, and a few loaves of <a href="https://www.feastingathome.com/pulla-for-lea/">pulla</a>, but bread was mostly beyond me. Just like the yeast that seeded Carl, my starter, sourdough making was in the air. My favorite sourdough baker Acme’s loaves became hard to get from Berkeley Bowl a few weeks into the quarantine, so I decided to follow along with everyone else, and get way too into bread making.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/boule2.jpg" alt="best loaf"></p>
<h2 id="starting-with-starter">Starting with starter</h2>
<p>I managed to snag a little flour and using a simple <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/">starter recipe</a> from the internet I began to grow a jar full of friends. For the first week or so, I think I had the temperature wrong, because all I managed to do was get a lot of <a href="https://truesourdough.com/sourdough-starter-troubleshooting-your-questions-answered/">hooch</a> without much of the expected doubling.</p>
<p>After lots of googling, I realized the key was not only keeping the starter in the oven with the light on, but also literally discarding most of it every time I fed it with fresh flour. Ratios, it turns out, are very important. I settled on 30g of water, and 30g of wheat flour ever afternoon, and before much longer, I was getting a lot of activity.</p>
<h2 id="finally-bread">Finally, bread</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/firstloaf.jpg" alt="first loaf"></p>
<p>My first loaves weren’t anything to brag about, but they were vaguely edible. I began to make bread before I really settled on a good recipe, and definitely before I had an active starter, so they were flat and dense. By my 4th loaf, I was approaching something I recognized as bread, and by my 6th, I was consistently getting a decent rise and crust. The biggest lessons during this time were around using my cast iron with and without a lid, and figuring out how to do timing so that I wasn’t trying to bulk ferment until 2am.</p>
<p>Timing would be a lot more challenging if I had to go to an office every day, so potentially I’ll have to really figure it out when I’m back to commuting next year. I’ve seen a few helpful tools for determining timing, but if I stay deep into the bread game, I might be waking up a lot earlier in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>With some hobbies I’ve gotten into the tools of the hobby way before I had any real talent or experience doing it. For baking, I started with very little. I had a 6qt Lodge cast iron pot, some dish towels, and a few metal bowls and glass jars, and that was it. No couché, no lame, no bench knife, and no banneton. As I kept making loaf after loaf, I quickly learned why bakers use these tools.</p>
<p>I struggled every loaf with stickiness, as unbeknownst to me, <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/best-sourdough-recipe/">my recipe</a>, which was a modified Tartine one, was very high-hydration. I ordered a banneton first, then rice flour to help coat it. next I added a large couché to my kitchen island for resting after bulk fermentation, and covered it in a dusting of wheat and rice flours. Everything go much easier. Finally I added a lame, which is basically a razor blade on a stick, to make cuts that turn into gorgeous bread valleys in the oven that allow the loaf to expand without tearing.</p>
<p>My kitchen still doesn’t include a bench scraper, but since I mostly make single loaves, that’s worked out ok. Once I learned to work with my dough with wet hands, I didn’t deal much with stickiness either. When making high-hydration recipes, folding and light touch are your friends—no kneading needed.</p>
<h2 id="the-little-things">The little things</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/boule.jpg" alt="less spring"></p>
<p>After 10 or 12 loaves I started learning the small things that could compromise my loaves. Dropping proofed dough too hard into a cast iron can blow out air bubbles, which hurts the oven spring. For my fridge at least, I need to let my dough sit out for at least 5 or 10 minutes or it’s too cold going into the oven, which also hurts spring. A friend recently mentioned how every recipe has to be tweaked for <em>your</em> kitchen, and the seasons and temperatures, and he was super right. As we get to Bay Area summer, I can already tell I won’t need the oven to bulk ferment, and my starter will activate <em>fast</em>. Every little thing reminds me that this bread is a living creature, enlivened by a colony of yeast that I guess I now have a symbiotic relationship with.</p>
<p>Ultimately, bread is amazing, and I’m so happy I started making it. Long live the sourdough yeasts. Long live Carl.</p>
