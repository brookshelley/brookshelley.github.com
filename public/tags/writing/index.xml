      <description>Inspired by both Nick and Matt, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try my hand at blogging again on this site. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how often I&amp;rsquo;ll post, but at least once a month, I&amp;rsquo;ll do a media dietpost, which clips out what I read and watched that month from the long lists I keep.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Inspired by both <a href="https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org">Nick</a> and
<a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org">Matt</a>, I&rsquo;ve decided to try my hand at
blogging again on this site. I don&rsquo;t know how often I&rsquo;ll post, but at least
once a month, I&rsquo;ll do a <a href="/tags/mediadiet">media diet</a>post,
which clips out what I read and watched that month from the long lists I keep.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll talk about other stuff too. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>
<p>I have definitely enjoyed how Matt seems to be posting cool things there
instead of Twitter, because it gives me more things to see on RSS. Speaking of
which, you can subscribe to my rss feed by dropping the URL to this site into
the reader of your choice—I use <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> with
<a href="http://newsblur.com">Newsblur</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something of a cool, old-school feel to writing on a blog and having it
delivered to folks daily via RSS, isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
