      <description>Out of 74 movies, I wanted to pick a few that really stood out, and then talk briefly about a few that I really didn&#39;t enjoy. I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn&#39;t get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I&#39;ve accrued over the years.</description>

      <description>This year started off with one of the goofiest movies I’d see all year: Murder on the Orient Express. I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:
Hunt for the Wilderpeople
This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight.</description>
