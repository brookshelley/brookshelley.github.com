<li>2 tablespoons of chili oil (any cooking oil will do though)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>I learned how to make mapo tofu from my first partner’s mom. She let me hang out with her in the kitchen and help, and I got to learn how to make a lot of tasty dishes that I still make regularly. Mapo tofu is probably my favorite, and I make it often. It is easy to prepare, and the leftovers are something I can munch on for 2-3 meals, even if I share a little. It goes super well on rice, or on its own.</p>
<p>Mapo tofu is basically a meat gravy, and as such, it’s ridiculously good. The szechuan peppercorns give your mouth a little extra numb salivation feeling, and the kick from the red chili paste matches the garlic really well. Fresh green onions brighten the dish. This is comfort food for sure.</p>
<p>Making this dish is pretty simple, and if you serve it to someone, there’s a good chance they’ll think you’re a much better cook than you actually are—it’s a great effort-to-result dish.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The recipe</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pour your chili oil into a pan—I use a cast-iron that usually has a little bacon grease in it, so I only add a little chili oil. Turn the heat up to medium- high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As your oil heats up, pour your ground szechuan peppercorns into the pan and heat for a minute or two, along with your ginger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your ground meat into the pan. Cook until lightly browned—around 5 minutes. Stir while you cook to make sure it doesn’t stick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move your pork a little to the side. Pour your chili paste onto the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir a little. You want to get this slightly brown, which takes maybe 2-3 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine the two in the pan, and stir more. Turn the heat down to medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add your soy sauce, and the black bean paste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine your water with your corn starch and dashi powder. Make sure it’s mixed into a smooth tan liquid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the mixture of dashi, starch, and water into the pan, over the pork. Keep stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, the dish should look pretty tasty. It’ll be a reddish brown with ground meat and sauce that’s beginning to thicken a little. Add more water or more corn starch as necessary (always mixing the starch with water outside the pan to prevent clumps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open up your tofu, and cut it 4 or five times long-end to long-end, then once through the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour in the tofu, and break it up a little more with your spatula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir to combine everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a few minutes, the tofu should be heated, and the dish is almost done!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut your green onion into small bits (1-2cm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save a little green onion for presentation. Pour the rest green onion in, and stir to combine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn the heat off, and serve in bowls over rice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some fresh green onion on the top to add a little color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dig in!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Leftovers keep for a few days, but if you like this dish, you’ll have trouble keeping any for longer than a day. In my house, it goes pretty fast.</p>
