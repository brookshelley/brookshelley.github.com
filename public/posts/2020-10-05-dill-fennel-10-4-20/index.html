			<h1 class="title2">D&amp;F 10-4-20</h1>
			<p>October is full of surprises and delights so far. I feel like so many of us have held our collective breath, waiting for folks who so flagrantly flaunt the recommendations of doctors and scientists to reap what they’ve sown. The reaping began on Thursday night.</p>
<p>After the low of the debate this week, which I ended-up watching after swearing I wouldn’t, Thursday was a breath of fresh air. The news is coming fast and very obscured by a fog of misinformation and lies, but I am reloading pretty constantly. I hope we figure out what the actual timeline of events was eventually.</p>
<p>But, you don’t read this newsletter for schadenfreude, right? Let’s get to those juicy, juicy links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ll start with a very long read on the potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry">end of tourism as an industry</a>. It’s pretty clear that nonstop cruise ships and careless gawkers are tearing apart cities and the natural environment, so it’ll be curious to see if any of that recovers from the COVID-19 shutdown. I think it’s super important for folks to travel to other countries with an open mind, but that seems pretty counter to traveling with a ship full of people just like you.</li>
<li>I’m pretty excited about this upcoming executive directed Nathan Fielder show:</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Also I wish this were true:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t want to be alarmist, but my sources inside Walter Reed are telling me that Trump has been having diarrhea for 13 hours straight. “The entire bed is saturated. The floor is covered. It’s even going up the walls. They had to bring in contractors to replace the sheetrock.”</p>&mdash; glamour puss (@maplecocaine) <a href="https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1312491103979892739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>

<li>Have you watched Pen15 yet? If not, I highly recommend giving it a go. Not only is it a hilarious and brutally real portrayal of the time period I grew up in, but it’s even a great portrayal of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/pen15-gabe-gay-storyline">growing up gay</a>. There is a fair amount of second-hand embarrassment, but even if that’s not your thing, I hope you give it a go. I can’t wait for part two of season two!</li>
<li>Here’s a great read on <a href="https://www.theconsciouskid.org/white-fragility/">white fragility</a>, the all-to-easy to fall into condition for my fellow white folks. I think it’s pretty important to remember that our discomfort pales in comparison to the real threats and pain felt by folks of color around us. This same “I’m hurt that you’re hurt” bullshit extends to queerness and transness as well. Learning and growing is painful, but it’s worth it.</li>
<li>These are by far the worst sexts I’ve ever read:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also the sexts in question are just... what? <a href="https://t.co/zTyuRwkJ2w">https://t.co/zTyuRwkJ2w</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCisiKqVdi">pic.twitter.com/cCisiKqVdi</a></p>&mdash; Claire Perry (@sclaire_perry) <a href="https://twitter.com/sclaire_perry/status/1312235858981015552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I love this piece on <a href="https://readymag.com/readymag/readme/define_and_conquer/">online writing</a>, though I guess it’s also an advert for the CMS it’s created in. There’s a real The Outline vibe to this, but I found some good tips on typography and spacing amidst all the wackiness. I’ve finally gotten <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">my site</a> into good shape, but every time I read something like this, I start to inch towards my sass file all over again.</li>
<li>Wow, it’s time to order <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">next year’s Hobonichi Techo</a>. I’ve used one of those diary/journals for the past 3 years, and I dearly love it. There’s a satisfaction to writing down my thoughts and the day’s events on paper. This journal pairs nicely with a <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-safari/">good fountain pen</a> because of the high-quality thin paper that doesn’t bleed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>With a month that is so full of wild news, I hope you’re able to take some time to breath and go on a nice ride or walk to clear your head. You’re not alone in this, and Snorri and I are also hiding out, and staying hunkered-down until we have a vaccine. Stay safe, satay healthy, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>
