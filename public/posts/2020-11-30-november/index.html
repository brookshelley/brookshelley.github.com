			<h1 class="title2">November</h1>
			<p>Well, I’m 36 now! This year was absolutely bizarre, but I’ve watched a ton of movies at least. I didn’t get much reading done this month though. I spent the first chunk of the month reading one book, but also played a lot of video games. It was PS5 month, so that meant giving a few things a go.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Afterland</strong> — Lauren Beukes</p>
<p>The most post-apocalyptic prostate-free fun since Y the Last Man. I read through this in one sitting, as it had a great pace and a solid plot.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Centigrade</strong></p>
<p>After a very cold night camping, I decided to watch this movie about slowly freezing to death in your car in Norway. I’m super glad I get to watch this with some wine and a wool blanket. Being super cold sucks! For a movie completely set inside a car, this is pretty well-shot and compelling. It was based on true events, I guess, but the whole baby thing was a hat on a hat.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Blart Mall Cop 2</strong></p>
<p>I watched this because of Til Death Do Us Blart after listening to the cursed podcast for a few years now. Somehow it was both different and worse than I had imagined based on the podcast. Long live the shadow man.</p>
<p><strong>#alive</strong></p>
<p>Ah, a simple zombie film updated for a world with social media. This was fun.</p>
<p><strong>Objectified</strong></p>
<p>It’s interesting watching this again 11 years after it came out. I’m once again using A MacBook Air, and I understand the Muji designer way better. I wonder how many CAD designers are still using 24” square displays?</p>
<p><strong>Night Moves</strong></p>
<p>The movie where Zuck gets really into direct action. “Killing all the salmon so you can run your fucking iPod whenever you want”. It’s really a shame he went back to running his nightmarish company after this. There’s a delightful Griffin Newman role near the end too.</p>
<p><strong>All About Lily Chou-Chou</strong></p>
<p>This is one of my all-time favorite films, but I hadn’t watched it in probably 10 years. Fortunately, it more than holds up as a sad and beautiful tale of shitty teen life. It’s a brutal film because kids can be cruel.</p>
<p><strong>Johnny Mnemonic</strong></p>
<p>Ah, a 90s cyber classic. Somehow I’d never seen this before today! Ice T with upside-down paintball goggles! Beat Takeshi! Udo Kier’s trans body guard! A military internet dolphin!! I would love to see this screenplay get remade.</p>
<p><strong>The Wolf of Snow Hollow</strong></p>
<p>Ostensibly a horror film, but mostly about a man’s alcoholism and what it’s done to his family and his life. Interesting take on the genre.</p>
<p><strong>Mortal Engines</strong></p>
<p>A fun YA-turned film. I don’t usually like Hugo Weaving but his big character acting worked for this. I didn’t expect much, so I had a good time.</p>
<p><strong>Tokyo-Ga</strong></p>
<p>It’s wild to see how little Tōkyō has changed since the 80s—or rather the bits of Shōwa that still peek through. This was a gorgeous look at both the Tōkyō that once was, and the echo of 50s and 60s Americana that lived in the youths of the time. I also learned quite a bit about Ozu, and how he filmed. Loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Columbus</strong></p>
<p>Gorgeous and sad. Two people meeting while their lives are paused for their parents and sharing a love of architecture without building a romance. The pace was pretty slow, but I like this kind of slice of life film.</p>
<p><strong>The New Mutants</strong></p>
<p>As a fan of the comic series and a few of these characters, I like that they tried to give them a horror story beginning, but ultimately it felt constrained. I’m disappointed that this won’t be part of the MCU or integrated with the X-Men. The comics are having a heyday, but for some reason the movies are still just not there.</p>
<p><strong>アキラ</strong></p>
<p>子供の時に私はアキラが一番好きので、十回の見た。特に今はそのちょっと変な映画、でも大好きの。昭和の有名映画と最高アニメと思う
I watched this a bunch as a kid. It’s super weird but it really holds up. A true classic.</p>
<p><strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></p>
<p>After the painfully sad movie about the hundreds of thousands who lost their lives in tsunamis, I dove deep into this three hour epic of utterly nightmarish depravity. DiCaprio plays what a friend calls Catch Me If You Can 2 very well:</p>
<p><strong>The Impossible</strong></p>
<p>The real lesson of this movie is that in 2004 kids were satisfied with only getting a red ball for Christmas. This is also a Spider-Man origin story. Brutal movie generally though.</p>
<p><strong>Possessor</strong></p>
<p>For context, I’ve loved the concept of assassins since I was a little girl, as odd as that might sound. A movie wherein an assassin mind-syncs with a random person to do their business is thusly fascinating. The horror of that connection and the challenge of doing your job basically in a coma with all of the gore and wildness that entails was thrilling. I love the obvious skill growth since Antiviral as well.</p>
<p><strong>Election</strong></p>
<p>Not sure how I hadn’t seen this yet. A delight. I love the successful lesbian sideplot, and how Broderick’s character fully self-destructs out of hate of a precocious child. Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Proxima</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to be a divorced mom while you’re an astronaut. Luckily, Eva Green is still super cool. At this point I’m curious if it’s a contractual thing to show her breasts once every 20 minutes? Instead of a movie about space, this was more of a movie about space-prep.</p>
<p><strong>The Dark Knight</strong></p>
<p>Ah, Heath Ledger. When this was made no one thought the joker was a hero, and yet, he became a bummer symbol for folks years later. It’s still weird to me that they switched actresses suddenly, but Queen Latifah is hard to resist, so I get it.</p>
<p><strong>Enola Holmes</strong></p>
<p>A fun movie to watch while waiting for these damnable election results. Millie Bobby Brown plays a great younger Holmes, while Cavill is an oddly fit Sherlock. The action moved briskly, and the little asides and jokes were charming. I’m here for a low-stakes adventure anytime.</p>
<p><strong>Batman Begins</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the fourth or fifth time I’ve seen this movie and it’s still such a blast. I wish it were easier to hear anything Batman says, but otherwise a delight.</p>
<p><strong>She Dies Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect, but this is a very <em>art</em> film vibe with a slow horror built-in. It definitely didn’t fit my mood tonight, but I’m not sure if that’s the film’s fault. Perhaps I should’ve stuck with schlock.</p>
<p><strong>Earthquake Bird</strong></p>
<p>The vibe of 80s Japan is a whole thing. So much hip Japanese literature I’ve read is firmly grounded in Showa-era Japan, so this felt a bit like watching a multi-cultural Murakami story. It’s rare to see a movie or show in both Japanese and English (Giri/Haji) comes to mind. I wish they’d worked with Vikander a bit more on her Japanese though.</p>
<p><strong>Last Holiday</strong></p>
<p>Heard about this from an Election Profit Makers bonus episode and honestly, I loved it. Sometimes you need something funny, kind, and hopeful. Thanks, last holiday, for soothing my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>Zodiac</strong></p>
<p>This was my 3rd of 4th rewatch. I’m a sucker for a slow burn Fincher film. I was still low-key mad that the other movie I watched today wasn’t a crime film, so I had to dive into one. Everything about this movie is so wild and well-executed.</p>
<p><strong>Sinister</strong></p>
<p>Fellow-Austin native Ethan Hawk slowly loses his mind while trying to write true-crime. If only he’d known you could just do a podcast instead! The worst ever character from the Wire is also in this. Overall, not very spooky but it leans a <em>lot</em> on goofy jump scares. Nice use of Boards of Canada though.</p>
