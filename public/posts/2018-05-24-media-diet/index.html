<p><strong>Lab Rat One</strong> — Andrea Höst</p>
<p>Ok, this series is exceedingly straight, and that's a bummer. I wish there
was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues
to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I've gotten slightly
sick of the cycles of &ldquo;power then injury&rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I'm
going to finish this out.</p>
<p><strong>Caszandra</strong> — Andrea Höst</p>
<p>Ugh, I wanted to enjoy the rest of this story, but this book was so
exceedingly dull. I <strong>loathe</strong> that the main character was setup to not
only get married, but have kids at ~19 years old. Fuck that. This series
started off well, but ended up being even worse than Twilight. Read the
first book, and skip the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Space Opera</strong> — Catherynne M. Valente</p>
<p>Uproariously fun, and silly throughout. Take Douglas Adams, add in some
queerness, and an obsession with Eurovision. Loved this from start to
finish. I devoured the back-half of this book in one sitting at a cafe in
Copenhagen, and found myself crying in the afterword/credits.</p>
<p><strong>Gold, Fame, Citris</strong> — Claire Vaye Watkins</p>
<p>Interesting book about a post-apocalyptic wasteland America and the ideas
of survival and family. I enjoyed this.</p>
<p><strong>Gods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach</strong> — Kelly Robson</p>
<p>A cool scifi short novel where the future is barren, but at least there's
time-travel. I wanted more world-building, and probably a couple more books
in this story, but that also means I liked this book quite a bit. The back
half of the book felt much faster than the lead-up, and much of the action
was compacted, but it was a fun adventure. This is a solid addition to the
burgeoning eco-scifi genre.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Geostorm</strong></p>
<p>A trash movie in the best way. If you liked watching Jake Gylenhall run
from ice in The Day After Tomorrow, and people saying &ldquo;zap!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;geostorm!&quot;, then this movie is for you. Continues the trend of big-budget
action films being largely targeted for non-US success, but that means we
also get some cool co-stars.</p>
<p><strong>In the Fade</strong></p>
<p>One of the saddest movies I've seen in a long time. It's gorgeous,
well-shot, and soundtracked, but phew, what a brutal movie about the evils
of nazism, and racism.</p>
<p><strong>Avengers: Infinity War</strong></p>
<p>This movie tried to tie together too many disparate stories, to bland
effect. The attempt at some sort of emotional climax was a big wet fart,
despite ten people in the theater I was in yelling at the screen. Like,
<em>spoilers</em> they'll all be back, bc Disney isn't going to kill off their
money-makers. Go rewatch Black Panther of Thor Ragnarok, or like, spend 3
hours outside instead.</p>
<p><strong>Deadpool 2</strong></p>
<p>As fun as Avengers: Infinity War was boring and meh. Full of silly jokes.
There were definitely jokes that were in really poor taste, but pretty
much what I expected.</p>
