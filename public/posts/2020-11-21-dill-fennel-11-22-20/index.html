			<p>Ah the start of my birthday week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I turn 36 next week, and the first time I&#39;ve felt OLD OLD was last year at a girl in red concert. I didn&#39;t know she was super young or that her fans were largely under 20. it was me, and the parents... standing in the back. great music though!</p>&mdash; brook shelley (@brookshelley) <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1329341287166734336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Birthdays aren&rsquo;t my favorite thing, but this year it&rsquo;s nice I get to celebrate living another year instead of the holiday wherein the US celebrates our subjugation and theft of land from thousands of nations of indigenous folks.</p>
<p>Fuck Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I wish we celebrated other fall holidays instead, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice">solstice</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuseok">추석</a> or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Thanksgiving_Day">勤労感謝の日</a>. Plus, Turkey is a low-tier bird. If you&rsquo;re going to eat a bird, <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/09/the-food-lab-how-to-make-peking-duck-at-home.html">roast a duck</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to raise a glass to my birth if you&rsquo;d like to—no sacrifices or animal products required.</p>
<p>Here’s a birthday soundtrack for you:</p>

<p>My plan is to drink a little wine or something outside with a friend, quietly. Alameda county just instituted a 10pm curfew, which I am not sure will be effective in curbing COVID cases. It seems like the <a href="https://twitter.com/BillFOXLA/status/1328932610169561090?s=20">jerks who have indoor meals and gatherings</a> will continue to do so. I have a couple friends who are seeing their families during Thanksgiving, but they&rsquo;ve been quarantining and will do so again afterwards.</p>
<p>I hope this can get better sooner than later, tbh.</p>
<p>Hope you&rsquo;re staying safe!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s <em>link it up</em>.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are your parents boomers? Have you wondered what the Internet might be like for them? <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/internet-baby-boomers-misinformation-social-media_n_5f998039c5b6a4a2dc813d3d">Wonder no more</a>. The short version is they see a vastly different internet than most of us, with a strong and upsetting trend towards right-wing misinformation from all sorts of shitlords. Instead of keeping the previous generation from installing spyware and malware from email links, it is now a responsibility of their kids to keep them from fully joining the death cult.</li>
<li>I got my new M1 Mac this week, and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition">so, so fast.</a> I wrote a bit about it on <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/apple-season/">my site</a>, but the short version is it does everything my old computer does faster, and with a significantly lower power requirement. Because of the redesign of Rosetta to be a translation layer, things even run faster through it too. I get the sense there will be a few months between now and when all apps are updated for Apple Silicon, but something like 90% of what I use is already there.</li>
<li>Do you feel a little lost in the surreality of the modern internet? <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">Here&rsquo;s a travel guide</a>. We&rsquo;ve come a long way since BBS and alt.mac communities, and I&rsquo;m curious to see if we move back into a world more focused on small private communities instead.</li>
<li>Maybe we&rsquo;ll <a href="http://www.printgrowstrees.org/index.html">print out</a> <a href="https://archive.qzap.org">zines</a> again instead. Who doesn&rsquo;t wish there were more issues of <a href="https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/528">Mean Dyke</a>? What about <a href="https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/563">Camp Trans</a>? There&rsquo;s so <a href="https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/337">much more</a> awesome stuff out there, and much like Geocities, I love seeing wild creations of folks not limited to 280 characters or being responded to by folks who don&rsquo;t bother to understand nuance.</li>
<li>Pour one out for a <a href="https://www.needsupply.com">website that was too expensive</a>, but I still browsed through occasionally in fits of capitalist pique.</li>
<li>We may not be able to travel right now, but we can go back in time a little and <a href="https://wimwendersstiftung.de/en/film/tokyo-ga-2/">view Tokyo through one man&rsquo;s camera</a>. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see how little parts of Japan have changed since the 80s.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>Listen to some calm music:</p>

<p>Love yourself and your friends.</p>
<p>Get real, real cozy.</p>
<p>I’m talking wool and nog. Candles and cats. Fireplaces, trees, baking a pie. This is truly the best season or hunker down and stay safe. I want to see all of your shining faces next summer.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of Saturday talking with my friend Lena on a hike about getting older and learning to appreciate who we are at our core. Her friendship continues to be such a boon. I hope you have a close pal you can just be yourself with over the phone, on a walk, or even as a partner.</p>
<p>Make something this week that smells amazing, space cowgirls~</p>
