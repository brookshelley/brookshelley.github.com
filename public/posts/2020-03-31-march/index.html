			<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Empress of Forever</strong> — Max Gladstone</p>
<p>A fun space romp with a Jobsian lesbian protagonist and a strange cast of characters. This quickly shifts into a very different book from what it starts as, but I still loved it. More space lesbians, please.</p>
<p><strong>A Song for a New Day</strong> — Sarah Pinsker</p>
<p>Welp, my second book for the month was another plague book, albeit one that largely took place in the aftermath of a pox. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, even if it was a <em>little</em> too hopeful for my usual taste. Honestly, it was a little refreshing to read a book where cool women make music and care about each other, and hope for the future. Thanks Haley for the tip on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Wanderers</strong> — Chuck Wendig</p>
<p>Phew, that was a dark fucking book. With the pandemic going on in the world right now, this wasn’t a very good idea to read, but I’m glad I finished it. Just about every bad thing you can imagine happens in this book, so I have a hard time recommending it, but perhaps for folks who don’t believe in global warming or in the danger of a pandemic, this will give them pause.</p>
<p><strong>Lurking</strong> — Joanne McNeil</p>
<p>A very interesting look at the history of the internet as a user. One of the best non-fiction books I’ve read in a while.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>The Martian</strong></p>
<p>Another rewatch. I had a FaceTime call where my friend Lena and I discussed Halt and Catch Fire, which reminded me how much I enjoyed this film, which I took to be about the competence of McKenzie Davis’ character. This was my first time watching this movie in 4K though, which made it look pretty amazing. Also, I always forget Donald Glover was in this.</p>
<p><strong>Skyfall</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the only movies to use a Land Rover Defender in a car chase, this is pure fun. The filming and action scenes were a wild step-up from the previous two films, and the stakes felt high throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum of Solace</strong></p>
<p>Far less memorable than Casino Royale. The first chase was fun, but a lot of the rest of the film kinda just meanders. I do appreciate the little nods towards older James Bond films though.</p>
<p><strong>Casino Royale</strong></p>
<p>Rewatching this in preparation for the eventual release of the final Daniel Craig bond film. It holds pretty well, save for the hilariously old-looking Sony phones and bootcut khakis. I’d forgotten Mads Mikkelsen was in this.</p>
<p><strong>Contagion</strong></p>
<p>I saw this in the theater when it first came out, but I haven’t seen it since then. This felt like a timely movie considering our current circumstances. I forgot Jude Law plays a weird crank reporter.</p>
