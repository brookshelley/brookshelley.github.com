<p>I’m in two book clubs. I read all the time. Reading is one of my oldest and most dear loves. The relationship between books and I is personal, consistent, and powerful. So, when <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">a social network for reading</a> came out years ago, I was ecstatic. Maybe now I’d build more community around reading! Maybe I would get amazing recommendations, and keep track of all the books I’d read and want to read. And, despite the awful, awful beige, I did… for a time. But slowly, Goodreads became focused on selling me books, and was purchased by Amazon. My friend’s updates became supplanted with things I might like, but the terrible beige stayed. Goodreads went from fun, to LinkedIn… for books.</p>

<p>Last year, I met my <a href="https://www.haleyfiege.fun">friend Haley</a> on a Slack group, and learned that she kept track of her reading on <a href="https://haleyfiege.tumblr.com">a Tumblr page </a>— complete with little reviews. I avidly read Nick’s blog of his current reads. I barely open Goodreads unless I’m updating my page count. It’s become a less joyful network. So, I thought perhaps I would also keep my own book blog, and finally bought <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">brookshelley.com</a></p>
<p>I decided to build off of my Github.io page, working with Markdown on Jekyll, both to play with Jekyll for work, and also to get something ready quickly that I can update by pushing commits to Github. It works! It’s easy. And I don’t have to visit somewhere beige to update it. I miss seeing my friend’s book updates, but in general it’s a far superior situation for me. I hated arbitrarily choosing a 5 star rating, so now I can say yea or neigh, but more importantly I can talk about them as much or a little as I want. I don’t have to worry about my blog selling to someone else… and even if Github doesn’t exist anymore, I’ve got the markdown files.</p>
<p>Running your own site isn’t for everyone, but I’ve been really happy being away from Goodreads. It’s pretty easy to start writing stuff in Markdown, and if you’re a tech person, Jekyll is a breeze to install, or you can just let Github handle it like I did.</p>
