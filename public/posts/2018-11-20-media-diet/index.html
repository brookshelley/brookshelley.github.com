			<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Circe</strong> &ndash; Madeline Miller</p>
<p>This book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you've read the Odyssey, this is a must read.</p>
<p><strong>Red Clocks</strong> &ndash; Leni Zumas</p>
<p>A bit too close to our dystopian reality for my liking, but this was well-written, and full of strong and interesting women. I read this as I was leaving Oregon, and so a lot of it was a little bittersweet. This reads as a more realistic (sadly) handmaid's tale.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Skyscraper</strong></p>
<p>So, so ridiculous and terrible&hellip; but also kind of great? Like, what if Die Hard wasn't as good, and had the Rock in Hong Kong? I watched this so I could listen to this week's How Did This Get Made, and I am glad I did.</p>
<p><strong>The Girl in the Spider's Web</strong></p>
<p>We're on our third Lisbeth actress, and while Claire Foy more than filled the shoes of Rooney Mara, the same can't quite be said for whoever replaced Daniel Craig. This was a fun, twisty movie, that was inadvertently stressful for my partner because of all the snow and ice driving. Lisbeth continues to deliver her brand of justice, while &ldquo;then Lisbeth hacks the thing&rdquo; is a major plot device. Kudos to all the lesbians in this, and the giant case of dildos. Fun movie.</p>
<p><strong>The Guilty</strong></p>
<p>A wild single-room movie, that takes place completely over the phone. I love the narrative device, and the slow, dread-filled pacing. The movie largely takes place in your own imagination, helped along by excellent foley, and voice acting.</p>
<p><strong>The First Purge</strong></p>
<p>Yow, what a good mess. I don't know why I love the Purge films, and to be honest, this one felt a little too real. However, I watched this on Halloween, so it fit my needs of a spooky, scary movie.</p>
<p><strong>Halloween (2018)</strong></p>
<p>This was goofy and fun, while still being a twisty thriller. Ultimately, these are morality tales about private property ownership, lol. A+ to Jamie Lee Curtis, and also all the random bit players. Definitely a good popcorn flick with friends.</p>
