<p><em>If you don&rsquo;t care about Cyberpunk 2077, skip to the links</em></p>
<p>After months of delay, and potentially transmisogynistic advertising, the <em>cyber witcher</em> is alive. I&rsquo;m playing Cyberpunk 2077, and so far, it&rsquo;s kinda fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent years wishing there was a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_Returns">Shadowrun game</a> that was an FPS, I think I finally have something essentially the same. I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s a bit more open-world than it currently is as I write this. I&rsquo;ll report back.</p>
<p>The year is <em>almost over</em> and that is a delight to me. I&rsquo;m taking the entire week of the 21st off from work, and that means I have a solid vacation from the 18th until the 3rd. Hurrah!</p>
<p>I hope you get a nice solitary break too, and lots of <em>eggs</em> if you&rsquo;re not vegan:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fill your head with links to pass that time~</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s set the mood with some music:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmSORFI2XzU" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>

<ul>
<li>My friend Lena <a href="https://www.tenpercent.com/meditationweeklyblog/good-snowflakes">sent this to me</a>, and it really helps with my mindset as we enter the 10th month of quarantining. If you&rsquo;ve never tried meditating, today is a good day to start. After all, you&rsquo;re probably reading this at home, and hopefully it&rsquo;s a bit quiet.</li>
<li>As an avowed fan of Russian literature, I deeply enjoyed this essay <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n21/patricia-lockwood/eat-butterflies-with-me">on Nabokov from Patricia Lockwood</a>. Firstly, pre-order <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/634158/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood/">her novel</a>. Secondly, Nabokov was very, very weird, but a great read. If you&rsquo;ve avoided him because of <em>Lolita</em> try Pnin or Pale Fire.</li>
<li>Spare 17 minutes to <a href="https://7ampodcast.com.au/episodes/yanis-varoufakis-on-making-billionaires-richer">listen to Yanis Varoufakis on how the current global economy seems hellbent on making billionaires richer to our detriment</a>. It&rsquo;s an appalling state of affairs, at least in this newsletter&rsquo;s opinion. One of the more frustrating aspects of this obvious pillaging of our planet is the rich' ability to convince everyone else that it&rsquo;s for their own good.</li>
<li>Do you miss <em>Flash</em>? I didn&rsquo;t much until I took a look at Archive.org&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/">flash archive project</a>. My old webcomic was completely created in Flash, so I&rsquo;ve considered trying to use this to bring it back.</li>
<li><strong>Newsletter recommendation</strong>! This one tackles some interesting topics, but I especially enjoyed this edition on <a href="https://genyeet.substack.com/p/america-pretends-it-does-not-see">the college scam</a>.</li>
<li>Need something to read over the holidays? Look no further than this <a href="https://kottke.org/20/12/the-best-books-of-2020">comprehensive list of book of the year lists</a>! My next few books are <em>all lined-up</em> with <em>Hammered</em> by Elizabeth Bear, and a re-read of <em>Infinite Jest</em> by David Foster Wallace currently on my nightstand. Even if you&rsquo;re not much of a reader, I highly recommend cracking something silly and fun open and <em>logging off</em> for a while. You might even enjoy it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>2020 was a lot, but with only a few more weeks until 2021 in the US we&rsquo;re getting our first doses of a vaccine. From what I gather, it&rsquo;ll be months (likely until next fall), until we&rsquo;re in a state to get back to pre-pandemic habits, but it&rsquo;s nice to know we&rsquo;re at least moving in a direction. As I write this, the US is still grateful that the Supreme Court rejected a seditious case from the Texas AG to seize power for their awful figurehead, and I also hope we get to move past this as well.</p>
<p>My plan for 2021 is to keep this newsletter going for another year, and perhaps experiment a little with format. Thanks for reading so far through these 54+ editions, or however many you&rsquo;ve come along for. I&rsquo;ve loved writing these little linky missives to you each week, and it&rsquo;s made me feel a lot less alone knowing that somewhere out there a few of you are enjoying some weird shit I sent you.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and all your emails back! Stay safe, and keep loving each other, space cowgirls~</p>
