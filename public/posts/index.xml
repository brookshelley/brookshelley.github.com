      <description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 10/4/20 October is full of surprises and delights so far. I feel like so many of us have held our collective breath, waiting for folks who so flagrantly flaunt the recommendations of doctors and scientists to reap what they’ve sown. The reaping began on Thursday night.
After the low of the debate this week, which I ended-up watching after swearing I wouldn’t, Thursday was a breath of fresh air.</description>

<p>October is full of surprises and delights so far. I feel like so many of us have held our collective breath, waiting for folks who so flagrantly flaunt the recommendations of doctors and scientists to reap what they’ve sown. The reaping began on Thursday night.</p>
<p>After the low of the debate this week, which I ended-up watching after swearing I wouldn’t, Thursday was a breath of fresh air. The news is coming fast and very obscured by a fog of misinformation and lies, but I am reloading pretty constantly. I hope we figure out what the actual timeline of events was eventually.</p>
<p>But, you don’t read this newsletter for schadenfreude, right? Let’s get to those juicy, juicy links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ll start with a very long read on the potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry">end of tourism as an industry</a>. It’s pretty clear that nonstop cruise ships and careless gawkers are tearing apart cities and the natural environment, so it’ll be curious to see if any of that recovers from the COVID-19 shutdown. I think it’s super important for folks to travel to other countries with an open mind, but that seems pretty counter to traveling with a ship full of people just like you.</li>
<li>I’m pretty excited about this upcoming executive directed Nathan Fielder show:</li>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Also I wish this were true:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t want to be alarmist, but my sources inside Walter Reed are telling me that Trump has been having diarrhea for 13 hours straight. “The entire bed is saturated. The floor is covered. It’s even going up the walls. They had to bring in contractors to replace the sheetrock.”</p>&mdash; maple cocaine (@maplecocaine) <a href="https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1312491103979892739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Have you watched Pen15 yet? If not, I highly recommend giving it a go. Not only is it a hilarious and brutally real portrayal of the time period I grew up in, but it’s even a great portrayal of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/pen15-gabe-gay-storyline">growing up gay</a>. There is a fair amount of second-hand embarrassment, but even if that’s not your thing, I hope you give it a go. I can’t wait for part two of season two!</li>
<li>Here’s a great read on <a href="https://www.theconsciouskid.org/white-fragility/">white fragility</a>, the all-to-easy to fall into condition for my fellow white folks. I think it’s pretty important to remember that our discomfort pales in comparison to the real threats and pain felt by folks of color around us. This same “I’m hurt that you’re hurt” bullshit extends to queerness and transness as well. Learning and growing is painful, but it’s worth it.</li>
<li>These are by far the worst sexts I’ve ever read:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also the sexts in question are just... what? <a href="https://t.co/zTyuRwkJ2w">https://t.co/zTyuRwkJ2w</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCisiKqVdi">pic.twitter.com/cCisiKqVdi</a></p>&mdash; Claire Perry (@sclaire_perry) <a href="https://twitter.com/sclaire_perry/status/1312235858981015552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>

<li>I love this piece on <a href="https://readymag.com/readymag/readme/define_and_conquer/">online writing</a>, though I guess it’s also an advert for the CMS it’s created in. There’s a real The Outline vibe to this, but I found some good tips on typography and spacing amidst all the wackiness. I’ve finally gotten <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">my site</a> into good shape, but every time I read something like this, I start to inch towards my sass file all over again.</li>
<li>Wow, it’s time to order <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">next year’s Hobonichi Techo</a>. I’ve used one of those diary/journals for the past 3 years, and I dearly love it. There’s a satisfaction to writing down my thoughts and the day’s events on paper. This journal pairs nicely with a <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-safari/">good fountain pen</a> because of the high-quality thin paper that doesn’t bleed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>With a month that is so full of wild news, I hope you’re able to take some time to breath and go on a nice ride or walk to clear your head. You’re not alone in this, and Snorri and I are also hiding out, and staying hunkered-down until we have a vaccine. Stay safe, satay healthy, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>September It’s been a wild month here in the Bay Area, with wildfires, smoke, and record-breaking heat. Because I didn’t have much else to do, I read and watched a lot of things. On the TV front, you should check out Ted Lasso for a kind-hearted, and joyful show. Lovecraft Country is not great on trans or queer issues, but is generally pretty awesome, and the Great British Bake-Off is back and quarantining together to prevent filming stoppage.</description>

<p>It’s been a wild month here in the Bay Area, with wildfires, smoke, and record-breaking heat. Because I didn’t have much else to do, I read and watched a lot of things. On the TV front, you should check out Ted Lasso for a kind-hearted, and joyful show. Lovecraft Country is not great on trans or queer issues, but <em>is</em> generally pretty awesome, and the Great British Bake-Off is back and quarantining <em>together</em> to prevent filming stoppage.</p>
<p>I’ve also begun to <a href="https://boxd.it/1cX0X">use Letterboxd</a> if you’re a fan of that site.</p>
<p>Welcome to FALL!</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Axiom’s End</strong> — Lindsey Ellis</p>
<p>This read like a fun alien movie. Definitely good for a first novel, but there was a lot of rushed action in the 3rd act after a bit of running around. If this series continues, I hope we get to go off-planet a bit as well. I still can’t quite picture the aliens in this book either, fwiw.</p>
<p><strong>Children of Dune</strong> — Frank Herbert</p>
<p>The wildest line in this book is near the end: “There was an adult beefswelling in his loins and he felt his mouth open, holding, clinging to the girder-shape of ecstasy”. This is probably the worst line of sexual prose I’ve ever read. Other than that, fun book! The end really picked-up the action after a lot of early intrigue</p>
<p><strong>How to Be Alone</strong> — Sara Maitland</p>
<p>A very pleasing slim tome on being alone that tackles the challenges and the pleasures of this pursuit. As a woman who lives alone and loves it, I liked seeing my lifestyle discussed here, as well as the gentle encouragements to try camping or traveling alone. I’ve personally found flying to other places by myself to be immensely fulfilling. If you feel as if you can’t survive without constant social input, this book might convince you to dabble in solitude.</p>
<p><strong>Dune: Messiah</strong> — Frank Herbert</p>
<p>Definitely a “kill your heroes” sort of book. After the wild, messianic build-up of Dune, it’s interesting to skip past the jihad of Mua’dib into a world where the dullness and frustrations of being a ruler and a deified person lurk. I think I’d previously tried to read this, but wasn’t able to finish, so I’m glad I made it through this try. This book is definitely heavier and slower than Dune, despite being shorter, but I’ve heard the third and fourth books are more interesting, and I think this is a necessary antidote to the high highs of Dune.</p>
<p><strong>The Lightness</strong> — Emily Temple</p>
<p>Ah, a Buddhist summer camp for bad girls! I enjoyed this tale of friendship and want quite a bit. I’ve enjoyed Buddhist meditation for a few years now so had heard some of the stories at margins of this book, but really it’s more about family and belonging. A great first novel.</p>
<p><strong>The Luminous Dead</strong> — Caitlin Starling</p>
<p>If you enjoy claustrophobic cave diving movies, this book will be up your alley. I love that Starling hinted at a very large galaxy of space exploration, but confined the reader to a single, wild cave. This was the kind of page-turner that kept me up till 4am to find out what happened. Very fun.</p>
<p><strong>The Relentless Moon</strong> — Mary Robinette Kowal</p>
<p>This series is super fun. It feels like cool lady space stuff is in the air lately, as For All Mankind feels a bit similar. I don’t know how I feel about us using resources to go to space vs. trying to preserve the planet, but I’d <em>way</em> rather us go to space than bomb places, so.</p>
<p><strong>A Peculiar Peril</strong> — Jeff Vandermeer</p>
<p>This was a bit of a slog. I generally enjoy the creeping horror and all-around bizarre confusion of a Vandermeer, but I think in his effort to build a YA novel, he may have lost the power of brevity. This book skips around between characters a little too much to build any real connections to any of them. I managed to finish it, but I can’t say I liked it that much. If Volume 2 is shorter, I could be tempted to dive in, simply out of sunk-cost.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Evangelion 1.11 &amp; 2.22</strong></p>
<p>A friend watched Evangelion for the first time recently, and I was reminded I never got around to watching these remakes/retellings. Really, really weird, but in a new ways. I kind of like that they cut out many of the extraneous slice-of-life stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Ava</strong></p>
<p>I love an assassin film, but this one managed to make everything feel a bit smaller and more banal. Pretty forgettable with the stakes of a lifetime drama but the fight scenes of an action film.</p>
<p><strong>Wall E</strong></p>
<p>Super cute and dystopic. I love this movie so much.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong></p>
<p>This was nothing like that Counting Crows song, but it was excellent. I didn’t know this story before watching the film, but fuck. I wish Vanessa Kirby had more to do, but I suppose that’s the issue with historical fiction.</p>
<p><strong>The Long Dumb Road</strong></p>
<p>A great buddy road movie. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is one of my all-time favorite movies and this channels the delightful failures and wonderful moments of the genre perfectly. I should’ve watched this a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>Blade Runner: 2046</strong></p>
<p>This held up though I wanted more McKenzie Davis scenes. Also! I forgot Ana de Armas was in this. Neat.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible 6</strong></p>
<p>Outstanding! After a little bit of a slump in 5, six was back to the wild heights of 4. The HALO jump was nuts, especially after looking into how they filmed it. I can’t stand Alec Baldwin, but everyone else in this is dope. A+ helicopter scenes as well. There’s car, and motorcycle chases, and even some outstanding Tom Cruise runs.</p>
<p><strong>The Da Vinci Code</strong></p>
<p>A real stinker, but silly enough to watch over a phone call with a pal. Ian McKellan was the best part of this film, with a close second being Bettany’s ability to look tortured and have sexual tension with literally everyone in every scene.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible 5</strong></p>
<p>A fifth movie and a fifth director. Renne is back, which I’d forgotten, and also this movie brings some truly wild times. This is the first time the IMF goes up against the Syndicate, and has a kinda fun Opera battle. There’s no huge building this time, but there was a big swimming scene.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible 4</strong></p>
<p>Benji, you fucking did it—you’re out in the field. I’m pretty glad Simon Pegg became a series regular, and especially glad that barely anyone else from earlier in the series didn’t. I do wish Keri Russell would come back though, bc she’s cool. Also this one has Stellar Skateboard.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible 3</strong></p>
<p>Aw, yea&hellip; JJ Abrams is here with Felicity and that guy that’s in everything he makes! This was a really fun time at the movies. So many printable face masks! Phillip Seymour Hoffman! Tom Cruise running! A terrible love story! Also, who can forget the ridiculous <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/mission-impossible-3-on-nokia-n93-3549677.html">Nokia phones</a> they used in this.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible 2</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not as good as the first. John Woo is great, but some of his signature shots and slo-no effects just come off kinda silly in this.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible</strong></p>
<p>What a blast from the past. The special effects were largely practical, which means they aged well, but the computer interfaces are delightfully 90s. I can’t believe how much this series has upped itself every incarnation, but this first one is still just a nice small-scale spy film.</p>
<p><strong>The Trip</strong></p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed Coogan since the Day Today sketches he did with Chris Morris, so it’s fascinating to see him age and keep doing odd versions of himself on film. Rob Brydon is excellent in this, and I’m reminded I should rewatch the entirety of Gavin &amp; Stacey. If you want to see two middle-aged men making very stupid (but funny) jokes and impressions while sampling haute cuisine in the north of England, this is your chance.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Park</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know how I survived the 80s and 90s. I did a lot of really, really stupid and dangerous shit, even if I never got to go to Action Park. We had Schiltterbahn where I grew up, which was way less wild, but still pretty dangerous at times. This film does a good job of showing the teen thrills of incredibly shady theme parks.</p>
<p><strong>Boys State</strong></p>
<p>I can’t stand the little conservative assholes. Steven Garcia was chill though. Also, it’s surreal to see how far right everyone went out of an assumption that other kids would be conservative, despite that being somewhat untrue. I went to UT as well, and it was pretty nostalgic to see Clark Field and other spots I spent a lot of time on film.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Reacher</strong></p>
<p>Not the best of the Tom Cruise action franchises, but fun enough. Light on action till the end.</p>
<p><strong>Genocidal Organ</strong></p>
<p>I watched this a while ago before I read the book. It’s kind of a fascinating, if quite gory, look into what we do for “security” and how our definitions of other are constructed.</p>
<p><strong>Nightcrawler</strong></p>
<p>Despite a lack of blue skin or a tail, Gyllenhaal embodied a character just as bizarre and rigidly pursuant of his beliefs. Deeply strange film.</p>

      <description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 9-27-20 Everybody watch out, I own a laser now. Far from being a futuristic laser pistol, it’s a much more banal home hair removal laser. As a trans lady, the ‘ol hormones left me with some annoying dark facial hair that I’ve mostly blasted off, but in quarantine time I’ve been unable to finish my treatment. So, if you hear some yowls coming from emeryville, that’s just me.</description>

As a trans lady, the ‘ol hormones left me with some annoying dark facial hair that I’ve mostly blasted off, but in quarantine time I’ve been unable to finish my treatment. So, if you hear some yowls coming from emeryville, that’s just me.</p>
<p>This weekend is also a great breadmaking weekend here. I’ve really figured out my bread recipe after months, and this is looking awesome.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s also time for the Formula 1 race in Russia￼, which hopefully will lead to a more interesting championship fight. I’m still excited for Lewis to clinch more lifetime records, as he clearly deserves all of them. However, I’m also excited to see some up-and-coming racers really making a name for themselves. I hope in the near future though we see more women and people of color in racing generally.</p>
<p>Let’s get on with&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you love design research? Then <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordion-icons/">you’re in luck</a>! Apparently it’s all about the caret and not the hamburger icon for accordions. Who knew!</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdWn7PCDqNUQvzmPaJPMEYqsXKAVcuE0MPxcJVdaKjw/edit#">This document</a> is a really awesome, and super worrying survey of the climate crisis we’re facing. I still believe somehow we will convince humanity to change tack and save our place on this planet, but it’s going to be rough.</li>
<li>Remember when <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/09/rich-famous-onlyfans-changing-sex-workers-left-behind-bella-thorne-caroline-calloway-beyonce">OnlyFans was just for cool sex workers</a> and real, real horny content? It turns out ex-Disney stars and other random celebrities have invited and rather ruined it for the rad folks who were making money on it before. Bummer. Listen, if you’re an influencer, stick to Instagram. Fuck off everyone who is like “oh I’ll just sell my nudes” as like a fun hobby—it’s a real job, and it’s real hard.</li>
<li>Second New Statesman link this week, but <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon">this one</a> is about a rad new book site called Storygraph. I’ve played around with it for a while this week, and it’s so much better than Goodreads, especially since it isn’t beige or owned by Amazon.</li>
<li>Have you ever been interviewed by someone with a real shitty agenda? <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times">Judith Butler teaches a masterclass</a> in this interview on how to parry and riposte just such a poor interview. I remember a lot of things Butler wrote being used against trans women in the early 2000s, but it’s really nice to see them come back to restate and clarify their support of trans women and other trans folks.</li>
<li>Free is <em>rarely</em> free, and if you aren’t paying for your hosting or web software, you’re often the <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites">product they’re really selling</a>. I’d encourage you to think long and hard about supporting cool companies like <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">Fastmail</a>, or even just using and contributing to excellent open-source projects like Hugo. This newsletter is sent via <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a>, for instance, because it’s well-made, and seems to take privacy and quality seriously instead of focusing on up-and-to-the-right growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems like we’re going to deal with COVID for another year at best, which is pretty frustrating. I hope you’re registered to vote, and are involved in local politics as well. We need better leadership, an more representation from folks of color, women, queers, and younger people. It’s super obvious that a country run by rich white people in their 70s is just going to such, so I hope we can pushing for something better.</p>
<p>I definitely have had a hard time with so much of the news and the utter lack of justice for black folks murdered by police, especially Breonna Taylor. This can’t continue.</p>
<p>I am in this with you, and I care. Let’s keep fighting together as long as we can. Keep safe, keep resisting, and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

<p>This year was mostly a nightmare for all the <em>gestures around</em> reasons.</p>
<p>However, for my 2020 homescreen on my iPad and iPhone, it was pretty wild. iOS 14 brought the concept of homescreen widgets to iOS after years of waiting, and they're pretty damn good.
<img src="/photos/ioshome2020.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="another-year">Another year</h2>
<p>Every year for the <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-28-2019-iphone-homescreen/">past</a> few <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-14-2018-iphone-homescreen-update/">years</a> I’ve written about the apps I’m using and what appears on my iPhone Home Screen. It’s become a fun annual post to think through how the app ecosystem and iOS in general changed over the year. I still use my iPhone quite a bit in quarantine, as it remains the easiest thing to haul around my house for podcast control and random tasks.</p>
<h2 id="more-change">More change</h2>
<p><strong>3 app dock</strong></p>
<p>I kept my 3 app dock from <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-28-2019-iphone-homescreen/">last year</a>, but replaced Music with Slack. I use Slack pretty constantly for keeping in touch with my friends, and also I work there. Lately, in order to encourage myself to <em>log off</em> from work on my off-hours, I removed my work workspaces from my phone. It’s delightful.</p>
<p>The other two apps are the same—Messages and Reeder. Both of these apps are a lifeline to loved-ones and reading respectively. I subscribed to a few friends’ Twitter feeds and a few newsletters in Reeder using Feedbin, and it’s quieter and <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-10-slower-reading/">slower over there</a>.</p>
<p><strong>No new app icons</strong></p>
<p>An astute reader will see the five app icons on my homescreen and think: “wow, you’ve gotten rid of everything!” And indeed I have! iOS 14 brought the delightful App Library which enabled hiding most apps from the homescreen, relegating them to search and odd Apple-generated categories. I likely have a few <em>more</em> apps on my phone than before, but I never see them unless I need them. I love it.</p>
<p>Overcast keeps getting better, especially with Marco focusing on stability and usability over rushing to get iOS 14 widgets or other whiz bang new things into the app. I like that Marco seems to get that so many of us depend on this app daily, and takes major changes seriously.</p>
<p>iAWriter is where I write. Full stop. I wrote this post in iAWriter, and even wrote about <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/hugo-and-i-a-writer/"><em>how I write in it</em></a>. It’s outstanding. I would happily pay much more money just to keep this app going. A+.</p>
<h2 id="widgets">Widgets!</h2>
<p>The elephant on my homescreen is the two prominent widgets at the top of the device. With the addition of regularly updating, informative blocks of app, I move my calendar and my music player into this format.</p>
<p>Fantastical is back! The widgets are great, and even though I can’t make it the <em>default app</em> in iOS this year—maybe next year? I think Fantastical still looks kinda weird on the iPad, but since I can view a smaller bit of it actively in a widget, I don’t need to open the full app nearly as often. The customization of the Fantastical widget is delightful, as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/09/23/fantastical-widgets-ios-14">others have written</a>.</p>
<p>Longplay is a new app this year that focuses on reminding the listener about older, neglected albums in our collection. I think the way it changes around album art is cool looking, and I especially love that it focuses on the <em>album</em> as a coherent whole, unlike many modern music apps that are more geared towards singles and bangers.</p>
<p>On my left screen&hellip; formerly the widget area (is this the name?) lives one app that was previously on my homescreen and another I went back to after an update.
<img src="/photos/iOS14widgets.jpg" alt="">
Things remains the way I get anything done in my life. I love it so much on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The sync is fantastic, the organization is just-enough, and the keyboard shortcuts are a master class in how to do them right.</p>
<p>Carrot Weather temporarily dethroned Hello Weather due to the addition of widgets. I still don’t love this app or how it displays data, but the widgets are delightfully minimal so I don’t need to look at the whole app often.</p>
<p>Simple is my banking app. It’s important to always have “funny numbers” in your account as a key to appeasing the money demons that ensure a positive ROI. Top tip.</p>
<h2 id="other-notable-apps">Other notable apps</h2>
<p>Working Copy and Secure Shellfish aren’t on my homescreen, but they’re both pretty crucial to a few kinds of server and front-end work that I do for fun on the iPad and iPhone.</p>
<p>Darkroom is the photo editor I moved to after some recent updates made it even better. I still wish it could resize photos on export, instead of just changing the quality of the photo or video, but hopefully later they’ll be able to. In the meantime, I made an iOS shortcut that does the resizing for me, and commits the photo to my blog’s repo.</p>
<h2 id="missing-widgets">Missing widgets</h2>
<p>One day soon, I hope my bank adds a widget, as well as Wealthfront, and perhaps Overcast and Sonos. Tot would also be an excellent widget for quick text entry. I don’t know if I’d keep it up all the time, but my Deliveries app also primarily functions as a read-only list, so it would be ideal for a side-screen widget.</p>
<h2 id="future-hopes">Future hopes</h2>
<p>I’m curious as more developers add widgets if their interest in adding more options for sizing and location. I think it’d be neat to have a single app icon widget, as well as write-capable widgets. Perhaps we’ll see this customization in iOS 15. I think now that the floodgates are open for what TikTok youth are seeing as custom themes, it’ll be hard to stem the tide of interest in actual shareable themes a-la Apple Watch. Further, I think it’d be pretty silly if iOS widgets and Apple Watch widgets didn’t end-up unifying in the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m super glad I don’t need to keep a ton of apps on my homescreen, and instead can show the apps I use most.</p>

      <description>A new keyboard Or, how I reprogrammed my brain to understand an ortholinear keyboard.
During my work from home, I’ve slowly upgraded my computing setup to keep me from constant soreness. First, it was a real deal office chair and desk, then a monitor. Finally this week, I added a split keyboard to alleviate wrist issues.
A history of keyboards For years I’ve written primarily on a MacBook or iPad keyboard, which is pretty cramped and ensures my trainer tells me to do more ITY stretches all the time.</description>

<p>Or, how I reprogrammed my brain to understand an ortholinear keyboard.</p>
<p>During my work from home, I’ve slowly upgraded my computing setup to keep me from constant soreness. First, it was a real deal office chair and desk, then a monitor. Finally this week, I added a split keyboard to alleviate wrist issues.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-keyboards">A history of keyboards</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/keyboardhistory.jpg" alt="">
For years I’ve written primarily on a MacBook or iPad keyboard, which is pretty cramped and ensures my trainer tells me to do more ITY stretches all the time. In the office I tried using a Microsoft Sculpt for some time, but I hated their weird wireless dongle. Not only was it frustrating to put a nubbin in a USB-A port, but it seemed to interfere with other ports or wireless signals.</p>
<p>A number of friends are huge mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, and I’d seen them around work pretty constantly, but I never really wanted one. For me, a woman who enjoys the MacBook 2015-2018 keyboard, and the iPad Smart and Magic keyboards, I didn’t think I would enjoy the force required to activate the keys, or the longer travel. I also worried that in an effort to move to a more ergonomic keyboard, I might ruin my ability to type on a regular one. I still don’t know what made me take the plunge, but I bought an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">Ergodox </a> to get going.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/ergodox.jpg" alt="">
Plugging in my Ergodox, my first thought was, “this is so utterly weird!” I quickly realized I’d need to program my keyboard to more closely match what I’m accustomed to on a Magic keyboard, which meant I spent quite some time on Oryx (their graphical configuration tool). After a few missteps and missing keys (turns out not having a <code>= +</code> key can be an problem, who knew?!), I settled on this:
<img src="/photos/ergodoxlayout.jpg" alt="">
Loading the configuration was super simple, and blazingly fast, which encouraged me to experiment and play around with new buttons. I gave myself quick keys for Alfred and Spotlight, as well as some easy copy and pastes.</p>
<p>I quickly learned I had some issues with overreaching various keys, like the <code>b</code>, and I would need quite a bit of practice before I stopped saying “damn, damn, damn,” and frantically backspacing. My coworkers this week have seen a huge increase in accidental messages, until I figured out a better place for my enter key than “exactly where my quote key was before”.</p>
<h2 id="week-two">Week two</h2>
<p>I’m slowly finding a rhythm with typing alphabetical characters, but I think it will be quite some time until I’m able to quickly choose random characters. I’m trying to learn which characters I use most often, to ensure they live somewhere on my first layer, and my second layer is dedicated to the rarely used characters that I don’t mind looking down to find. Without keycaps that reflect the layers I will definitely run into the issue of not being able to look down to remind myself of where things are, so maybe I’ll pin a screenshot indefinitely on my desktop.</p>
<p>A few friends who’ve used these keyboards assured me I wouldn’t be ruined for regular layouts by using the Ergodox, but I’ve already found myself trying to backspace on the left side of the keyboard or hit the area around the spacebar to press enter. I think I should be able to type on two different keyboard layouts in turn eventually, but for now it’s still confusing.</p>
<p>My WPM went from an abysmal 50 to ~65 after the first week of use, and my hope is that it keeps climbing back up to my more usual 85+. It’s still too early after two weeks to tell if the Ergodox is helping my wrist and shoulder issues, but they at least aren’t exacerbated.</p>
<h3 id="fun-with-keys">Fun with keys</h3>
<p>I quickly learned after ordering my keyboard that there are myriad custom options from keys to cables, not to mention different switches that you can replace. I ordered a few keys and a few cables to play around with the aesthetics, but other than a shorter TRRS cable, I don’t think any change has really effected my use much. I put purple keys into the spots for alt, ctrl, and command mostly to help hone in on those modifier keys whenever I get lost.</p>
<p>A word of warning: many awesome keysets are group buys with long lead-times, so it’s best to think of ordering a few and then forget about them and have the package as a surprise later.</p>
<h2 id="moonlander">Moonlander</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/moonlanderlayout.jpg" alt="">
Imagine my surprise, a week after getting a new Ergodox when ZSA announced a <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">new keyboard</a> just as I settled into using mine. I couldn’t resist the siren song of “next-generation ergonomics” or the idea that this keyboard would be more portable, so I picked my second ZSA keyboard in black and waited for it to arrive from Taiwan.</p>
<h2 id="week-three">Week three</h2>
<p>The clack of the keyboard tells me I’m back at work, and at my desk again for the next 4 days.</p>
<h2 id="week-nine">Week nine</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/moonlander.jpg" alt="">
After quite a few weeks with my Ergodox, my Moonlander arrived. I immediately set it up, then forgot what the default layout was. Eventually I got Wally launched and loaded my layout, only to tweak it a bit to make some of the keys more usable. The big red keys are a little challenging to hit, but my main issue was finding a good command layout for doing cmd+k in Slack constantly. It’s funny how the keyboard shortcuts that are so common become so integral to how your keyboard is laid out. Perhaps I’ll make single key macros at some point too.</p>
<p>By the time my Moonlander arrived at the end of September, I’d become pretty accustomed to my Ergodox, and been through a dozen or so tweaked layouts. My typing speed is around 85wpm again, but the most important part is my wrists and hands feel way better￼. I went with Brown switches for both of these keyboards, and even though they’re not very clunky I feel pretty happy with the sound. Surprisingly, typing on the iPad Magic Keyboard still feels nice￼ too. When I first started using these new keyboards I worried that the cognitive load of hopping between them and a regular layout would be too much, but so far, it’s easy. I don’t relish the idea of doing a Dvorak setup though.￼</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Switching from a standard keyboard to an ortholinear mechanical keyboard is no mean feat. I definitely struggled the past few weeks with various issues typing rare, but important keys, as well as remapping my brain to remember where I’d put everything. Overall though, for the comfort and feel, I think it’s worth it to try one. We’re stuck at home in the states for at least 6 more months, so why not take up a weird keyboard hobby in the meantime.</p>

      <description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 9-20-20 Finally, a brief respite in the smoke! I got to go on a nice long bike ride around the lake as soon as the air hit green. The rest of the week could’ve been spent outside, but I mostly just worked-out and play video games. Oh well.
The news of RBG’s death last night made me pretty sad, but also reminded me that a future that’s better than any past we’ve had depends on each and every one of us resisting and working towards it.</description>

<p>Finally, a brief respite in the smoke! I got to go on a nice long bike ride around the lake as soon as the air hit green. The rest of the week could’ve been spent outside, but I mostly just worked-out and play video games. Oh well.</p>
<p>The news of RBG’s death last night made me pretty sad, but also reminded me that a future that’s better than any past we’ve had depends on each and every one of us resisting and working towards it. It’s very helpful when folks dedicate their lives towards causes, but if everyone puts in like 10% effort we’d be in a better place, I think. So, VOTE. Donate. I’m on the host committee this year for the Trans Law Center’s gala, so it would be dope if you <a href="https://app.mobilecause.com/e/YB54-Q?vid=br1bq">attended or threw in some cash</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’m playing lots of Dark Souls (yes, the first one), and cooking, and trying to learn how to mop effectively. It turns out after 35 years of life, I might actually be someone who cleans regularly. I still miss being able to hire a housekeeper though.</p>
<p>Let’s get on with the links!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ann Helen Petersen, recently of the Burnout article that went around wrote about <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/your-surge-capacity-is-depleted-it-s-why-you-feel-awful-de285d542f4c">surge capacity</a>. We’ve all been operating in bursts since March 2020, in addition to the nexus of challenges and pains that we’re dealing with normally.</li>
<li>Have you heard how everyone is <em>fleeing the cities</em> for the suburbs? It <em>turns out</em> that <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/8/31/21404333/suburbs-housing-boom-urban-exodus-coronavirus">just isn’t true</a>. There’s so much fearmongering these days, but despite rents falling a bit in cities like San Francisco, folks’ reasons for staying in the cities are the same as their reasons for moving there in the first place. For me at least, moving somewhere without queer or trans rights just <em>isn’t an option</em>.</li>

<li>This remains <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/5495/how-to-beat-linked-in-the-game">one of the funniest things I’ve read in a while</a>. Joe is a great writer, and a good friend. I don’t think he’s ever endorsed me for anything on LinkedIn, but if I knew how to endorse people, I would endorse him for “humorous content”, and “looks good in a Miata”.</li>
<li>Speaking of Joe, he texted me a <a href="https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram">very good link</a> the other night, and it had me dead from laughter.

<li>Finally, let’s talk about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190206-what-the-meat-paradox-reveals-about-moral-decision-making"><em>eating meat</em></a>. Yea, that’s right, putting dead animal parts into our mouth holes. It’s weird, but also totally normal. It <em>turns out</em> most of us don’t like to consider how those animal parts get into our mouth holes from fields and trees. I eat a very plant-heavy diet these days, and try to consume only animals I would or have killed. I can’t say you have to live your life this way by any means, but I <em>do</em> think it’s worth considering the impact your diet has on the world and on specific animals.</li>

<p>The best time to start meditating is yesterday, and the second best time is today, to paraphrase something half-remembered. If you can take some time to just breathe, it’s a neat, free way to feel just a little bit better. If you have a little bit more money and time, therapy is also excellent. We’ll be in this kinda shit for a while to come, it seems like, and I know I’ve benefited from support and these two practices.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of the links this week made you laugh a bit, because laughter is dope. I hope wherever you’re reading this from you’ve got a nice day ahead of you. Stay safe, keep fighting, and I’ll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

<p>In positive news, it’s the Tuscan GP weekend in F1, and the track is super fast and wild. I don’t think it’ll be a big passing track, but qualifying was super close.

Hail Satan! While I’m not sure that curses actually work, I’m all the way here for cursing people. Placebos <em>are</em> effective, so perhaps placebo curses are also effective? Let’s curse the bastards.</li>
<li>Speaking of curses, are you cursed with specialist knowledge you can’t communicate? Steven Pinker has <a href="https://fs.blog/2016/03/stephen-pinker-tells-us-why-our-professional-writing-sucks-and-what-to-do/">some tips</a>! This was a pretty interesting read on how to write for you audience, instead of your coworkers when writing technically. I personally loathe super-jargon-y writing, of which there is a ton in tech. So, I hope you absorb this for anything you write, and aim towards digestible, interesting writing.</li>
<li>This last week, for no apparent reason I started rewatching all the Mission Impossible films from the beginning. I find Tom Cruise pretending to be deeply straight quite amusing, and was convinced by my pal Drew that watching him run is also a delight. I think the 4th movie is my favorite so far, but hilariously I found out that MI3 was <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/mission-impossible-3-on-nokia-n93-3549677.html">released on the Nokia N93</a> which is featured in the film. I’m all about stupid merchandising tie-ins, and this one is perfect. Imagine watching Tom Cruise run around on a 2.4’ <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n93-1551.php">240x320px screen</a>. This was a time period where I was importing Nokia phones from Asia and Europe to use myself, so I definitely wanted this absurd phone for myself. I wonder <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nokia-N-Series-N93-Silver-Unlocked-Smartphone/143623148929?hash=item21709b5581:g:zTAAAOSwPpZaIEbg">if EBay has one with MI3 loaded?</a></li>
<li>This week, I was also thinking about how Q Anon is just an updated version of anti-Semitic blood libel bullshit. Turns out, <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/72339/qanon-is-a-nazi-cult-rebranded/">I wasn’t the only one</a>. I find this stuff seriously disturbing, in addition to being utterly absurd. I genuinely wish people would find a way to disown Zionist crap, and embrace Jewish people and perhaps even the Jewish faith.</li>
<li>This week marked the 19th anniversary of 9/11, and <a href="https://www.opednews.com/articles/American-Muslims-19-years-by-Abdus-Sattar-Ghaza-Activist_Alliances_American-Muslim-Voice_Anti-Muslim-200911-172.html">anti-Muslim sentiment is still a huge problem</a>. My Muslim friends have described the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/was-there-really-a-post-9-11-backlash-against-muslims/256725/">abuse</a> and <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-12/data-hate-crimes-against-muslims-increased-after-911">hatred</a> they felt in the ensuing 19 years, and It makes me sick. No one should be persecuted or hated for their faith or culture. Learn about Islam, and care for the Muslim folks around you. Stand up to the bullies and bigots, because our planet is too small to be a narrow-minded asshole.</li>
<li>Let’s learn to <a href="https://blog.longnow.org/02020/07/20/six-ways-to-think-long-term-a-cognitive-toolkit-for-good-ancestors/">think long-term</a>. This planet will outlast the human race, possibly, but most certainly a struggle and hope for rights and a better world will outlast those of us reading this in 2020. It’s a great idea to <a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/building-a-peace-narrative/">think of a peace narrative</a>, and commit to efforts that will last for generations. I personally find a great deal of solace in being part of a multi-generational effort to win rights and support for LGBTQIA folks around the world. Find your cause, be it environmental, or social, or both, and get involved. The planet will appreciate it, as will many generations to come.</li>
<li>To finish out this week, let’s consider how wild it is that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/790609.stm">so many people die on stairs</a>. There are <em>way</em> more deaths on stairs than due to shark attacks, but a movie about falling down the stairs would be pretty boring. Unless&hellip; what if the stairs were <em>haunted</em>? Spooky, killer stairs. I dunno. Just spitballing here.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>Let’s have a better week than last week! Reach out to a friend or two you haven’t talked to in a while, and say hi. Tell them you care, and you’re thinking of them. We’ll get through this present series of crisis, and I personally think part of doing so is deepening the community we’ve built. Hug a friend (safely), pet, or partner and think of the things in your life you’re grateful for and the things you love.</p>
<p>Silly, or poignant, there are so many amazing works of art and media in the world. Are you reading or watching anything fun? <a href="mailto:hello@brookshelley.com">Let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Also, happy Apple announcement week to those of you who eagerly anticipate spending money at the altar of Apple, Inc. It should be a wild ride.</p>
<p>This week’s email was a bit all over the place for me emotionally, but that’s where I’m at, so sorry/not-sorry. As always though, take care, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Becoming a plant lady Ten years ago, I saw indoor plants as inconvenient, unwieldy, and dirty. Now, my house looks like this:
What happened?
Thanks Laurel One year for Christmas, my roommate in Portland gave me a book and a single plant, and once I figured out how not to kill it, I got addicted to greenery.
I think it was the combination of cloudy skies, and an appreciation of the outdoors that Portland granted me which helped me change.</description>

<p>Ten years ago, I saw indoor plants as inconvenient, unwieldy, and dirty. Now, my house looks like this:</p>

<p>What happened?</p>
<h2 id="thanks-laurel">Thanks Laurel</h2>
<p>One year for Christmas, my roommate in Portland gave me a book and a single plant, and once I figured out how not to kill it, I got addicted to greenery.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/firstplant.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I think it was the combination of cloudy skies, and an appreciation of the outdoors that Portland granted me which helped me change. I’d seen Laurel grow a few house plants, and reading <a href="https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/living-with-plants-by-sophie-lee/9781784880965">the book she gave me</a>, it seemed like a thing I could do too.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/plantbook.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>From the pothos I started with, I quickly expanded to a stag horn fern, and a few birds of paradise. I killed more than a few plants by overwatering the first few months of trying to understand how to plant though.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-california">Moving to California</h2>
<p>When I moved to Oakland, I realized I wouldn’t be able to bring my plants with me. The thought of staring over with plants was daunting, but I found <a href="https://cactusjungle.com">Cactus Jungle</a> on the recommendation of a friend, and quickly set about picking up a few snake plants and pothos. Every time I visit that shop, I pick up a new plant, pot, or little gift for a friend. It’s a delightful place, with helpful staff and usually a bit of available street parking. A few of my plants even came from my pals Wonja and Dan as a very special and thoughtful housewarming gift.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/snorriandplant.jpg" alt="snorri and plant"></p>
<h2 id="cats">Cats</h2>
<p>My main worry once I sorted out how to keep plants alive was whether or not Snorri would eat any of them and get sick. Not knowing a ton about plants, I was constantly googling and reading about non-toxic plants, often opting for 'this might make your cat throw up' when I couldn't find &quot;chow down&quot;. Luckily, outside of a few very small snake plants (sansevieria trifasciata), he's largely uninterested in my plants. As long as I keep the ones he like to gnaw or bat at higher than he can reach, my plants and my cat seem to peacefully coexist.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/newpots.jpg" alt="new plant pots"></p>
<h2 id="re-potting">Re-potting</h2>
<p>One thing I eventually learned is that plants don’t like being crowded in their pots. When the visible above-soil leaves look crowded, or they start to grow tall or long, often the roots underneath are super cramped. To fix this, I give my plants a new pot that’s significantly larger than before, with fresh soil. Usually, this means a mass shuffle, wherein I move 3-7 plants from smallest to largest after buying a big pot. I’ve even worked together with my friend Wonja to help repot particularly heavy or large snake plants on her back deck.</p>
<p>Usually, the easiest way to loosen the plant from the pot is just to reach your hand in and under, gently pulling it out. I then dust the soil off, and sometimes wash the roots a bit, then re-pot and add soil.</p>
<p>If you own a tarp, it might be a good idea to throw one down while you do this, or you’ll be doing quite a bit of sweeping afterwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes during this phase of plant life, I also split my plants up, propagating or relocating sections of the plan in a smaller pot. After you get an initial plant, outside of water, and occasional soil and fertilizer, these babies grow you new plants at no cost.</p>
<h2 id="quarantine">Quarantine</h2>
<p>With the COVID quarantine, there are days where it’s too challenging or stressful for me to go outside, but I learned when Laurel first introduced me to house plants that they really help make a house feel good. Now, even though I may be stuck inside due to smoke or disease, I can look around at a veritable forest of gorgeous plants. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/urban-mindfulness/200903/plants-make-you-feel-better">Studies</a> suggest that this plants are generally very positive for your mental and physical health. I still love when I can go to an actual forest, but when it’s not possible, I try to breathe and run my fingers over the leaves of my green pals.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/outsideplants.jpg" alt="outside plants"></p>
<h2 id="future-plants">Future Plan(t)s</h2>
<p>At some point, I’d love to have birds of paradise again, and plants suspended from the ceiling—maybe spider plants? There’s a ton of vertical space in my apartment, and it could be very neat to have a small run of plants overhead. My courtyard outside already has a wealth of plant life, and I’ve added a few aloe plants to it, but I think once the out of doors is less dangerous, I might go ahead and spruce it up as well with a small table and perhaps a few more big plants.</p>
<p>If you’ve never been a fan of indoor plants, this might be the perfect time to find a small nursery or succulent shop nearby and stain your thumbs a bit green.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 lb Pork (or lamb)</li>
<li>1 package of soft tofu (I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mori-Nu-Silken-Tofu-Soft-Ounce/dp/B000LKZ84W/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490135388&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=silken+tofu">Mori-Nu</a></li>
<li>20 or so freshly-ground Szechuan peppercorns (packaged is ok)</li>
<li>Half a cup of red chili &amp; garlic paste</li>
<li>2 slices of ginger (or more)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of black bean garlic paste</li>
<li>2 green onions</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of dashi powder (or one cup of chicken/fish stock)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of soy sauce or tamari</li>
<li>1 cup of water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of rice flour/potato starch</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of chili oil (any cooking oil will do though)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>I learned how to make mapo tofu from my first partner’s mom. She let me hang out with her in the kitchen and help, and I got to learn how to make a lot of tasty dishes that I still make regularly. Mapo tofu is probably my favorite, and I make it often. It is easy to prepare, and the leftovers are something I can munch on for 2-3 meals, even if I share a little. It goes super well on rice, or on its own.</p>
<p>Mapo tofu is basically a meat gravy, and as such, it’s ridiculously good. The szechuan peppercorns give your mouth a little extra numb salivation feeling, and the kick from the red chili paste matches the garlic really well. Fresh green onions brighten the dish. This is comfort food for sure.</p>
<p>Making this dish is pretty simple, and if you serve it to someone, there’s a good chance they’ll think you’re a much better cook than you actually are—it’s a great effort-to-result dish.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The recipe</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pour your chili oil into a pan—I use a cast-iron that usually has a little bacon grease in it, so I only add a little chili oil. Turn the heat up to medium- high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As your oil heats up, pour your ground szechuan peppercorns into the pan and heat for a minute or two, along with your ginger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your ground meat into the pan. Cook until lightly browned—around 5 minutes. Stir while you cook to make sure it doesn’t stick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move your pork a little to the side. Pour your chili paste onto the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir a little. You want to get this slightly brown, which takes maybe 2-3 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine the two in the pan, and stir more. Turn the heat down to medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add your soy sauce, and the black bean paste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine your water with your corn starch and dashi powder. Make sure it’s mixed into a smooth tan liquid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the mixture of dashi, starch, and water into the pan, over the pork. Keep stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, the dish should look pretty tasty. It’ll be a reddish brown with ground meat and sauce that’s beginning to thicken a little. Add more water or more corn starch as necessary (always mixing the starch with water outside the pan to prevent clumps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open up your tofu, and cut it 4 or five times long-end to long-end, then once through the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour in the tofu, and break it up a little more with your spatula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir to combine everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a few minutes, the tofu should be heated, and the dish is almost done!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut your green onion into small bits (1-2cm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save a little green onion for presentation. Pour the rest green onion in, and stir to combine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn the heat off, and serve in bowls over rice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some fresh green onion on the top to add a little color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dig in!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Leftovers keep for a few days, but if you like this dish, you’ll have trouble keeping any for longer than a day. In my house, it goes pretty fast.</p>

      <description>Hugo and iAWriter When I started writing my blog in earnest again, I wanted to find a workflow I could use on both iOS and Mac with ease. I use an iPad and iPhone mostly, so I didn&#39;t want a system that required a lot of fiddliness, which meant a build pipeline that automated as much as possible. My goal was a site I could write to, publish to, and read from with a minimum of app switching or ssh-ing.</description>

<p>When I started <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2017-08-01-markdown-books-blog/">writing my blog in earnest again</a>, I wanted to find a workflow I could use on both iOS and Mac with ease. I use an iPad and iPhone mostly, so I didn't want a system that required a lot of fiddliness, which meant a build pipeline that automated as much as possible. My goal was a site I could write to, publish to, and read from with a minimum of app switching or ssh-ing.</p>
<h2 id="static-site">Static site</h2>
<p>Originally, I was using Jekyll, as it's the basic GitHub Pages static site generator, but I fell for the speed and weird Go templating of Hugo. I've tested Eleventy and Gatsby as well, but Hugo remains my top pick. I built a custom theme for my site, along with a SASS file that hopefully is organized enough I could do some easy switching around if I get itchy for a redesign.</p>
<p>In order to build my site fast, and ensure it loads super quickly, I moved to system fonts which meant I've achieved a delightful 1.0s full-content load time. No matter where or how someone accesses my site, they're sure to need limited bandwidth and data to read it.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about Hugo, <a href="https://gohugo.io">their website</a> is pretty great. You're also welcome to <a href="https://github.com/brookshelley/brookshelley.github.com">creep my repo</a>, and even fork it to get started yourself. My theme is very basic, but there are a <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">ton of them</a> out there to suit most tastes.</p>
<h2 id="build-pipeline">Build pipeline</h2>
<p>Once GitHub launched their Actions feature I was pretty sure I could go without a separate CI app or something like Netlify (though Netlify in specific is pretty awesome and has a really good DNS feature I still use). There are a bunch of cool Actions out there for building and launching static sites, but I use <code>[actions-hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo)</code> from Shohei Ueda.</p>
<p>It's super simple, and here's the yaml:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-YAML" data-lang="YAML">name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  <span style="color:#75715e"># Set a branch to deploy</span>

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu<span style="color:#ae81ff">-18.04</span>
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span> 
          fetch-depth: <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: ‘<span style="color:#ae81ff">0.71</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">.1</span>’
            extended: <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
</code></pre></div><p>Essentially, you set your public branch, and Github actions for pulling Hugo, building your site, and the deploying it to the public directory run in order. The whole process takes around 30 seconds with the <code>hugo --minify</code> build step completing in 400ms. Kicking off the whole build only takes pushing an update to the source branch I use. Other than that push, there's no real manual input required.</p>
<h2 id="ia-writer">iA Writer</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/iawriter.jpg" alt="iawriter"></p>
<p>My love for iA Writer continues to grow every year. It's not just a fantastic place to write, but increasingly it's a solid platform to publish to the indie web from. With one-click flows for Micro.Blog, Micropub, Wordpress, and other sites, it's super easy to write and get something online. My only wish is that somehow it could support photo upload in the same manner. I also love the Quattro font the team at iA Writer created as a slightly variable monospaced font. Their support of iOS, Mac, and the iPad is excellent, not to mention very good keyboard shortcuts for all of them. Simply put, iA Writer is my favorite place to write and create.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The only part of this whole process I haven't sorted out is testing builds from my iPad or iPhone. I may need to use Netlify again to do so, because while I have the ability to run things on another server, I'm a bit lazy when it comes to setting up rules around port forwarding. Most of the time if I'm doing active development of my site, I try to use a Mac or just very lazily roll changes out at night, reverting or fixing forward if there's an issue. Luckily a broken build never deploys, so worst case I might just put a post up that's missing photos, or have some odd spacing.</p>
<p>I would never recommend doing this for something that super matters, but my website is a fun little project, so it doesn't need five 9s of uptime.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-with-micropub">Publishing with Micropub</h2>
<p>I previously covered this with <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/microposting/">another post</a>. I didn’t do much customization to the GitHub code I linked to in that post, so your mileage may vary, but using Heroku for free, I’m able to tap publish on iA Writer for a nice, easy update to this blog. Previously I used the iOS Shortcut linked below, which was also fine, but during the beta period became a bit unwieldy in addition to not being available on my Mac. I briefly considered an Automator action to replicate the same features, but hopefully at some point shortcuts will come to the Mac￼ instead. I might update my Micropub server at some point to remove some of the weird stuff I don't really use from it, but that's a project for another vacation.</p>
<h2 id="ios-shortcuts">iOS Shortcuts</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcea1fc7792a4be7952e9d4ac6e34018">My iOS Shortcut flow</a> is pretty straightforward, and I snagged a lot of it from other examples online. The only semi-fancy bits are the text-parsing I use to title and build metadata. iOS Shortcuts are kind of a pain-in-the-ass, but once you get used to the weird way of building them semi-visually, they're pretty powerful.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>My site has come a long way from when I <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2017-08-01-markdown-books-blog/">started it up again</a> three years ago, while leaving <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley">Medium</a> as a platform. Hell, Medium has changed focuses four or five times in that period as well, now going back towards a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/whats-around-the-corner-for-medium-b79e8764c9cd">customizable blogging place</a>. I'm pretty happy I set up my own little world of blogging and archiving content, and hopefully with the information above you can do the same if you want.</p>

      <description>Hiking Thanks to my friend Lena, I got to test out my new hiking shoes today at Redwood Regional Park.
We did a very chill 5 mile hike with 1500’ climb and a total descent of 1000’.
I think my workout program is really helping because while it wasn’t always easy to hike this trail, it was super doable and really fun. I ended-up with only a couple small blisters I chalk up to brand new shoes.</description>

<p>Thanks to my friend Lena, I got to test out my new hiking shoes today at Redwood Regional Park.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/onshoes.jpg" alt="On shoes"></p>
<p>We did a very chill 5 mile hike with 1500’ climb and a total descent of 1000’.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/redwoodhiking.jpg" alt="redwood hiking path"></p>
<p>I think my workout program is really helping because while it wasn’t always easy to hike this trail, it was super doable and really fun. I ended-up with only a couple small blisters I chalk up to brand new shoes.</p>
<p>The thought of crowded trails during COVID was stressful, but the reality of hiking during the day (since I’m on vacation this week) was incredibly relaxing. I think we saw a total of 10 people over the course of 2 hours, and everyone was masked. We also saw a bunch of lizards, and cute dogs.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/forest.jpg" alt="forest"></p>
<p>The forest paths were naturally very cool, and relaxing, and even the sunny bits were around 20C/68F which meant we didn’t need to constantly stop to hydrate.  I haven’t hiked a lot since I lived in Texas, so I’m looking forward to trying to do more hiking even without flying anywhere. Lena and I talked about how much walking we both enjoy doing when traveling, but how we’re less likely to do so in our hometown. Hopefully I can do a bit more and actually embrace traveling close to home.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/me_hiking.jpg" alt="me"></p>

      <description>August I really jammed a lot of movies into the last few months of August, but mostly I watched The Boys and Alone. I’m hopeful Hollywood will give up on theater launches of films so I can watch stuff like Tenet sooner than later. Also, fuck our state’s ability to deal with the wildfires and the damage to folks’ health and us being forced inside. It’s a hella bummer that global warming caused by the global north is slowly making California inhospitable.</description>

<p>I really jammed a lot of movies into the last few months of August, but mostly I watched The Boys and Alone. I’m hopeful Hollywood will give up on theater launches of films so I can watch stuff like Tenet sooner than later. Also, fuck our state’s ability to deal with the wildfires and the damage to folks’ health and us being forced inside. It’s a hella bummer that global warming caused by the global north is slowly making California inhospitable.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</strong> — Haruki Murakami</p>
<p>An excellent reread, though Murakami is pretty bad at talking about women.</p>
<p><strong>Goldilocks</strong> — Laura Lam</p>
<p>A little too real at times, this pairs well with Emergency Skin. I think my only complaint was the flashbacks went on a little too long, which slowed down the tension of the present-day story. Mostly I really dug this though.</p>
<p><strong>Harrow the Ninth</strong> — Tamsyn Muir</p>
<p>For a book that was maddeningly confusing for almost its length, I loved it. I literally could not put it down and read the whole thing largely in one go. Beautiful, bizarre, and baffling. I cannot wait for the third book. More. lesbian. necromancers. in. space. please. Oh and for everyone complaining there wasn't enough Sci-fi in Gideon, this book has malevolent planets AND space stations. So.</p>
<p><strong>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</strong> — Alix E. Harrow</p>
<p>A fun portal fantasy set in the early 1900s. This was decidedly a YA book, but moved along quickly and had enough fun world building to make me hope for a sequel. I also appreciated the use of alternate worlds to talk a bit more about race, gender, and sexuality, but hoped that would translate a little more into the main characters desires. As always, my throne for more lesbian protagonists.</p>
<p><strong>How to be Bored</strong> — Eva Hoffman</p>
<p>I've read a lot of books <em>kind of</em> like over the last few years, and this is one of the better-stated and brief ones out there. If you would like to read a book about attention and enjoyment, this is solid. It's high-minded and well-cited without coming off pompous either.</p>
<p><strong>The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps</strong> — Kai Ashante Wilson</p>
<p>Ah, I wish there were more good gay fantasy novels. This was brutal, heart-warming, and confusing at various turns. I loved that the language of the book was an AAVE, along with other patois. My hope is that Wilson writes more set in this world of magic and godlike alien technology.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Violent Cop</strong></p>
<p>This is a rewatch, but I think it’s been at least 15 years since this first time I saw it. Beat Takeshi is a treasure. This movie is delightfully filmed. I kinda love the 80s Japanese film look, which is more reminiscent of TV than film. A classic</p>
<p><strong>An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn</strong></p>
<p>I hope folks had fun making this movie&hellip; it felt like everyone was trying a little to hard. This felt like an extended Tim &amp; Eric skit. Everything was just off.</p>
<p><strong>Sputnik</strong></p>
<p>I thought this would take place in space, but it’s mostly a fairly tight alien captive story. Enjoyable but not too wild or original.</p>
<p><strong>The Rental</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I’m glad I don’t have to stay in any Airbnbs soon after seeing this creepy movie. Whether it’s spycams, or the slow dawning realization that someone is watching, the way the vacation unfolds in this film is super scary.</p>
<p><strong>Alien: Covenant</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I love this ridiculous sequel to Prometheus. I think it captures the creeping horror of Alien and Aliens quite well, and is chock full of cool actors. I hope Scott keeps making solid Alien films for a while to come.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>
<p>Still liked this movie, but the weird romance plot was uncomfortable AF. Also the way religion tied into it was hamfisted.</p>
<p><strong>2:22</strong></p>
<p>Watched this so I can enjoy this week’s How Did This Get Made. It wasn’t great, and tried a little too hard to be clever without actually being entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>John Wick 1-3</strong></p>
<p>Rewatched all the John Wick movies out of a desire for action and style, and they delivered. This series isn’t super substantive, but it’s an action movie smorgasbord.</p>
<p><strong>Prometheus</strong></p>
<p>A deeply satisfying addition to the Alien canon. I’ve watched this move a number of times, and it continues to thrill me.</p>
<p><strong>Barista</strong></p>
<p>I don’t watch a lot of documentaries, but this was pretty fun if a little telegraphed. The only downside to this film is now I want coffee, but it’s 1130pm.</p>
<p><strong>Ride Your Wave</strong></p>
<p>The creator of Devilman Crybaby and The Tatami Galaxy made a really delightful anime about adulthood and love. It was gorgeous and pretty touching, even if it made me really wish I could fly somewhere again. There’s also a weird parallel between this show and every season of Terrace House: namely there’s surfing, and firefighters.</p>

<p>With flying out of the question, especially to other countries, I decided to do a bit of local adventuring. With the encouragement and planning of some Slack pals, I began to plan for a few days of backpacking, and more importantly, a few days of gear. Anyone who’s read my blog for a bit knows I’m a nerd about backpacks, technical clothing, and having the absolute minimum amount of stuff with me on trips. At home, I live pretty comfortably, but when I’m out of the house, I love the deep thrill of having exactly what I need.</p>
<p>The last camping trip I went on was during the eclipse 3 years ago in Dallas, Oregon. We drove there, and barely had to hike to put down our gear, so I brought a blow-up couch, a Nintendo switch, and medium-weight backpacking gear. I had an old REI sleeping bag that I’ve used for years, a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/864138/mountain-hardwear-optic-25-tent">Mountain Hardware Optic 2.5 tent</a>, and a few jugs of water. All my gear, with 2 gallons of water hanging outside my pack as I was used to desert camping in Texas, weighed a bit over 25lbs, without food. This is pretty great for a car camping or one night camping situation, butI love going further and not having nearly as much on my back, plus I needed to bring food in my bag because I wouldn’t have a cooler with me on this upcoming trip.</p>
<p>Thus began my list:</p>
<h3 id="total-weight-337kg-or-744lbs">Total weight: 3.37kg or 7.44lbs</h3>
<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/nemo.jpg" alt="nemo"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1275.72g <a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/camping-and-hiking/backpacking-tent/nemo-dragonfly-2">Nemo Dragonfly</a></p>
<p>This is a new addition to my list, but so far it seems neat, albeit very small. If I needed to spend extended time in a tent, I’d probably want something larger, but for a spot to sleep I think this will do just fine. I replaced the stakes with 60g of <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/tents/tent-accessories/groundhog-tent-stakes/05807.html">MSR groundhog stakes</a>.
<img src="/photos/nemopacked.jpg" alt="nemopacked"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60g <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/tents/tent-accessories/groundhog-tent-stakes/05807.html">MSR Groundhog tent stakes</a></p>
<p>Dependable light stakes. I’ve bent one of these only once when applying my full body weight through my foot into hard ground. In most cases this is very chill. I’ll probably dig a hole in the future, or possibly not even use stakes depending on the setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/photos/sleepsystem.jpg" alt="sleep system"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>455.01 <a href="https://enlightenedequipment.com/revelation-stock/">Enlightened Equipment Revelation</a></p>
<p>My most recent trip was with my old sleeping bag, and I spent the entire night with it open due to the heat. I learned that my air mattress is super comfy even sleeping directly on it, and that I made the right decision to switch to a quilt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>340g <a href="https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite-air-mattress">Thermarest Neoair XLite air mattress</a></p>
<p>This is a big comfort upgrade over my Z-Packs folding mat, even though it’s definitely more annoying to blow up and deflate. I sleep on my side often, so I like knowing I can adjust this a bit to facilitate that instead of basically sleeping on a thin foam cover over bits of rock. I might try bringing the inflation sack to save my lungs, and maybe I’ll store clothes in it or something in the meantime.
<img src="/photos/nemoinside.jpg" alt="inside Nemo"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-213073">Weight: 2130.73</h3>
<h2 id="bag">Bag</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/hyperlitebag.jpg" alt="hyperlite"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>904g <a href="https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/2400-junction">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Junction 2400</a></p>
<p>This bag is outstanding. It’s so, so light, while still being incredibly tough, and roomy. It’s rated at 40L, but seems absolutely to be an endless bag of holding. I love that it has waist pockets for snacks, and a few webbing loops on the shoulder straps for a water bottle or a phone or camera.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-904g">Weight: 904g</h3>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/cookingsystem.jpg" alt="cooking system"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>72g <a href="https://www.toaksoutdoor.com/collections/frontpage/products/pot-550-l">Toaks titanium pot</a></p>
<p>Another new addition. Up until now I used the terra system that came with my crux lite, but never used both pots. I can’t fit my fuel and my stove inside with the lid, but that’s totally fine. I love that I can easily use this as a mug too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>72g <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/146426/optimus-crux-lite-stove">Crux lite stove</a></p>
<p>Absolutely my favorite stove. It’s effective, quick and super light. I’ve used this for years, and it’s always worked save for the time I was trying to boil water with a 50mph wind blowing at me. Eventually, I hid behind a car and was able to make coffee.
<img src="/photos/foodbag.jpg" alt="food bag">
food bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16g <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/titanium-spork">Snow Peak Spork</a></p>
<p>I’ve had this spork for a long time—even before Snow Peak was cool again. Like, seriously I think I’ve eaten meals with this spork for 15 years. Love it. Durable and delightful. Mine is purple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ursa bear bag</p>
<p>This bag is only approved at certain campsites, but should be nice for those as an alternative to a rigid bear canister.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-270g-terra-stoves-471g">Weight: 270g (Terra stoves 471g)</h3>
<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/assortedcamp.jpg" alt="tech gear and other accessories"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>188g <a href="https://bookriot.com/amazon-kindle-oasis-review/">Kindle Oasis</a></p>
<p>My entire library can camp with me without adding bulk or weight. Plus, it’s waterproof!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>188g iPhone 11 Pro</p>
<p>Basically whatever the latest phone from Apple is, I’ll have it. This one is great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>192g 10000mAh external USB battery</p>
<p>Keeps my iPhone, watch, and AirPods charged. This one is very small, and only has one USB-C and one USB-A port, so I do a little juggling of plugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20g Assorted cables</p>
<p>A small Satechi watch charger and a C to Lighting and C to C cable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) 416.74 Anker Solar charger</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-588g-98474g-with-a-solar-charger">Weight: 588g (984.74g with a solar charger)</h3>
<h2 id="assorted-gear">Assorted gear</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>14.7g <a href="https://kulacloth.com">Kula cloth</a></p>
<p>A recent trip was my first time using this cloth, and largely it ruled! My one big mistake was getting a little too much camp soap on it, and having to wash it for a while to remove the soap. I think I can probably safely avoid soap for a couple days, and just wash it off with water.
<img src="/photos/befree.jpg" alt="befree bag"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70g <a href="https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/14946-8019639-katadyn-beefree-0.6L_usa">Katadyn BeFree bottle with filter</a></p>
<p>This water filter sack is outstanding. The flow rate is super fast and the entire setup is light AF. I also picked-up a 3L version of the same setup for group camping or if I think I’ll be away from water sources for longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70g Matador water bottle</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a straw with the ability to bite to get water, which makes this easy for drinking on the trail.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>113.40g <a href="https://www.miir.com/collections/pourigami-travel-coffee-system/products/pourigami-portable-travel-coffee-dripper">Miir Pouragami</a></p>
<p>This is a little heavy to bring along if I’m hiking a lot, but it’s hard to beat the ability to do a pour over for friends. Usually I’ll bring <a href="https://canyoncoffee.co/collections/coffee/products/instant-coffee">fancy instant coffee</a> instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>46g <a href="https://www.opinel-usa.com/products/opinel-knives-no-7-carbon-steel-folding-knife">Opinel knife</a></p>
<p>A fantastic classic knife. This is good for cooking or various cutting tasks. It’s not the lightest but I dig it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-1547-2681g-with-pourigami">Weight: 154.7 (268.1g with pourigami)</h3>
<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Icebreaker merino shirt</p>
<p>This is my standard shirt that I wear almost every day. It’s great, comfortable, and light. It also keeps me warm and dry most of the time, and stands up to hand-washing well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coalatree trailhead pants</p>
<p>I used these pants on a recent trip, and was a excited about the pillow feature of the pockets, but ultimately it was a little uncomfortable so I might try something different next trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports bra</p>
<p>Sometimes this is wool, but it’s always wicking. No cotton here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Icebreaker merino underwear</p>
<p>Dries quick, doesn’t get too stinky, and is comfy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Darn tough merino socks</p>
<p>I’ve had a bunch of merino and other material socks, and I keep coming back to these. They’re comfy, wash and dry quickly, and keep my feet comfy for hikes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merino buff</p>
<p>Works as a hat, a scarf, a temp face cover, and even as a wrap for my improvised pillow that is a bit softer. Love it. I’d resisted getting a buff for years, but frankly, I was a fool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/photos/onshoes.jpg" alt="on shoes"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.on-running.com/en-us/products/cloudventure-peak">On Cloudventure Peak</a> shoes</p>
<p>I’ve never worn hiking shoes or boots on backpacking trips or even to hike—I’ve never even owned any! I picked these up to help mitigate my slippiness on loose terrain, as the last time I went hiking I kept falling down. Hopefully these are comfy and grippy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>311g <a href="https://www.teva.com/women-sandals/original-universal/1003987.html?dwvar_1003987_color=CYR#start=3&amp;cgid=women-sandals">Teva sandals camp shoes</a></p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ll bring trail sandals on every trip, but they’re super comfy and I enjoy being able to take off my shoes at the end of the day but still wander around camp a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jacket</p>
<p>This depends on the conditions, but either a <a href="https://huckberry.com/store/proof/category/p/60691-shift-packable-shell">Proof shell</a> or a <a href="https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-torre-womens-high-performance-windpro-hoodie-jacket">Mission Workshop Torre jacket</a>. If it’s particularly cold or rainy, I also have a <a href="https://hiconsumption.com/snow-peak-fire-resistant-outerwear/">Snow Peak FR trench</a>. I tend to get warm pretty easily, but hate getting super soaked, so I optimize for staying dry and layer a bit. The FR trench plus my Torre worked well for me down to -5C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hat</p>
<p>Merino wool watch cap from <a href="https://www.tannergoods.com/collections/hats">Tanner Goods</a>. This hat is excellent and has kept my head and ears warm in four or five countries. It also doesn’t get too stinky when it’s been hiked in a lot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="camping-report">Camping report</h2>
<p>I’ve only camped once with a lot of this gear, and eagerly wait for the end of fire season so I can do a bit more camping. Ultimately, it performed well but I’m excited to see how nice it is to hike with so little weight and set up shop in my little Nemo tent. If you want to chat about gear or ask questions about mine, feel free to <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">hit me up</a>.</p>

      <description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 8-30-20 Welcome to my delayed last newsletter of the month. I had some pals by yesterday to sit at a distance in my courtyard and when the last one went home, I fell right asleep. It’s such a nice thing to see friends right now, especially when you can share some wine and lots of laughs.
This week is a mix of weird and sad as usual. I’m working on some longer form posts for brookshelley.</description>

<p>Welcome to my delayed last newsletter of the month. I had some pals by yesterday to sit at a distance in my courtyard and when the last one went home, I fell right asleep. It’s such a nice thing to see friends right now, especially when you can share some wine and lots of laughs.</p>
<p>This week is a mix of weird and sad as usual. I’m working on some longer form posts for brookshelley.com in the coming week about backpacking and mechanical keyboards, so keep your eyes peeled for those too.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>What if environmentalism but also <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/06/26/the-big-green-lie/">racist and xenophobic</a>? Unsurprisingly the global north doesn’t want to talk about our role in destroying the planet through unreasonable use of resources. It’s just so much easier to blame the “other” of the global south for having children, or daring to build industry. The sooner we see Earth as a planet we all need to share equally, the better in my mind.</li>
<li>Speaking of resources, I watched quite a bit of the TV show Alone over the past few weeks in preparation for a <em>podcast</em> and I wondered, “how easy would it be for them to harvest salt from the ocean to season their dang food?” The answer, it turns out, is both <a href="https://www.outdoorrevival.com/instant-articles/harvesting-salt-from-the-ocean-a-great-skill-to-learn.html">not too hard</a>, and very challenging to do in a survival situation. I super hope on some season someone becomes a master of seasoning.</li>
<li>If you were a kid in the 80s, you might remember these fantastic toys from MASK, and apparently huge dead stock crates still exist of them:</li>
</ul>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<ul>
<li>The MASK toys led me down a bit of a curiosity hole, and I found out a <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Rubsign">cool feature of Transformers</a> was <em>actually</em> a way of verifying toys weren’t <a href="http://www.collectiondx.com/toy_line/bootleg">bootleg</a>. Honestly, bootleg toys are super weird and cool. I fondly remember shopping at dollar stores and shitty grocery stores that mostly stocked these knock-offs. If you’re still a fan of Transformers, like I know my friend Justin is, you might enjoy looking at <a href="http://www.transrepro.com/">these reproduction parts</a> made by a guy with a passion for recreation. The world of toys is&hellip; something I try to avoid spending money on, but it’s certainly tempting to help 35 year-old Brook live the dreams of poor kid Brook.</li>
<li>Do you like cats? Do you like poems? Here’s some very old Chinese poems from a person who hired a cat to kill his pests, and ended-up as we all do, falling in love:</li>

<p>Sorry about the delay! I am writing this conclusion while I watch the Belgian Grand Prix, grateful that F1 has managed to race despite not having a <em>bubble</em>. This week was long, but next week I’m on <em>vacation</em>! I’m excited, even if I don’t get to do much outdoor adventuring due to the smoke that blankets so much of California right now. I hope you too get to take a vacation soon—you deserve it. For now though, stay safe, keep fighting and I’ll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 8-23-20 Ah, breathe deep the fires of California. Just in case you needed another reason to stay inside and wear a mask, dry thunderstorms have delivered. I don’t know how you feel about this but it’s pretty depressing and scary to me.

<p>Ah, breathe deep the fires of California. Just in case you needed another reason to stay inside and wear a mask, dry thunderstorms have delivered. I don’t know how you feel about this but it’s pretty depressing and scary to me.</p>

<p>Sorry to kick off with a bummer! I hope you’re ok with occasionally being sad together before we dig into the joyful weirdness of links. Thanks friends.</p>

<li>Now that it’s reached the end of an 8 year run, I can safely send you to the delightful series <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-1-title-page/">Oh Human Star</a>. Perhaps someone can share with me a good way of keeping track of your progress through a web comic, but I’ve been reading this via a manual updated bookmark for a while. It’s cool, it’s queer, and Blue is a really nice human.</li>
<li>As a stock market player/money-haver who previously worries about having food to eat and electricity as a kid, it’s very apparent to me how huge a gap there is between the rich and the poor. Here’s more about <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/stock-market-real-economy-disconnect-unemployment-poverty-coronavirus-trump">that horrific reality</a>. What if we all committed to addressing this wealth and economy gap in our lifetimes?</li>
<li>WOW, I hope you like uncontrollable bathroom problems! Remember Olestra? <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-failure-of-the-fat-free-revolution/">Remember that whole nightmare?</a> I certainly do. For some reason (diet culture) my family was really into Wow chips, even once it was somewhat obvious that they were going though us like <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727278-tips-lose-weight-after-quarantine/">konjac</a>. Man, the 90s were weird.</li>
<li>Speaking of things I can’t digest, albeit in this case delicious ones, why not try some <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-so-cheese">ancient Japanese cheese?</a>. I <em>love</em> these culinary trips into history, especially when they actually look delicious. Beer recipes from thousands of years ago? Count me in! And yet, they still won’t let us <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/egyptian-sarcophagus-red-juice">drink the mummy juice</a>.</li>
<li>If, like me, you’ve taken to reading during the quarantine you may have encountered <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/june/how-to-ignore-phone-while-reading-books.html">this roadblock</a>. Spoiler: it’s your phone. IMO turn off all your notifications always, because if someone needs you they’ll call you. My friend <a href="http://helentseng.com">Helen</a> gave me <a href="https://phonebreakup.com">this book</a> a year or two ago, and it was pretty helpful in finding new ways to be a little more at peace with my devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s one thing you want to do this week that makes you happy? For me, it’s making rice pudding. I love rice pudding and I’ve never cooked it, so I’m pretty amped. Oh, and I’m baking more bread, obviously. I also <em>treated</em> myself to a game from my wish list: Farcry 5. I’ve heard it’s deeply strange and I can’t wait to dive in.</p>

I’m planning a backpacking trip in the near future that has me pretty stoked, especially because of all the gear I get to buy and try out. I’m a sucker for gear, obviously.

<p>I can’t believe summer is almost over! I think I talked about this last week too, but it’s wild to me that summer has largely happened indoors, with nary a lake or pool in my life. I’m pretty excited about the opportunity to go camping soonish though, because I’ve really missed being able to hike and camp since leaving Texas and my outdoor pals behind. Hopefully in the coming weeks I’ll have some exciting (but not too exciting) photos and stories to share from <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-08-07-a-few-weeks-with-a/">my new camera</a>.

      <title>A GR III review</title>

      <description>A GRIII Review A street photography camera for empty streets In the before times, I travelled a lot. On average I flew 25 times a year, and left the country on 2-4 of those trips. I&#39;ve written a lot about traveling light, so it won&#39;t surprise you that I usually bring my iPhone as my sole camera. A few years ago, I picked-up a Canon G9X Mark II to take with me to Singapore and Reykjavik.</description>

<h2 id="a-street-photography-camera-for-empty-streets">A street photography camera for empty streets</h2>

<p>In the before times, I travelled a lot. On average I flew 25 times a year, and left the country on 2-4 of those trips. I've written a <em>lot</em> about traveling light, so it won't surprise you that I usually bring my iPhone as my sole camera. A few years ago, I picked-up a Canon G9X Mark II to take with me to Singapore and Reykjavik.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/singapore.jpg" alt="singapore"> <img src="/photos/reykjavik.jpg" alt="reykjavik"></p>
<p>While I enjoyed the size of the camera, and the high-quality shots, at the end of those trips, I largely stopped taking it with me because the trade-off in packing wasn't worth the gain. It was a little too frustrating to carry <em>one more thing</em> with me while hiking or wandering the city too.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/gr3b.jpg" alt="ricoh grIII back"></p>
<p>With that said, it likely seems strange that I just bought a Ricoh GRIII, especially during a pandemic when it's unlikely I'll be going much of anywhere. What convinced me to try the second camera thing again was both a lingering desire for a GR that I'd acquired when friends had film Ricohs in college, and a little bit of wanting to focus on shooting photos and not immediately sharing them with the world. It also doesn't hurt to have a new hobby that encourages me to walk and ride my bike around.</p>
<h2 id="carrying-it-around">Carrying it around</h2>
<p>In the short time since my trips to Iceland and Singpore, sling bags became very trendy, and with them, the easy way to bring a camera and nod much else along for an adventure. With nothing more than my phone, a usb to lightning cable, and my GRIII I can take photos, transfer them quickly, and edit them using <a href="https://darkroom.co">Darkroom</a> or <a href="https://www.polarr.com">Polarr</a>. When it's chilly, or I'm on a bike ride, I can either stuff this into my jacket or a <a href="https://www.orucase.com/collections/accessories/products/the-smuggler-handlebar-bag?variant=32785756815499">bike bag</a>, and my hands are unburdened. I also picked-up a <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/products/type-17-camera-sling-strap">strap from DSPTCH</a> so I can wear my camera when biking or walking. I've found in the past that it's pretty helpful to have a stabilizer strap as well, so I added one to my kit.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/grstrap.jpg" alt="dsptchstrap"></p>
<p>With a bag or a strap like this, I've found that sans-flying, just carrying the camera around is very easy, especially if I shoot regularly during my walk. It's pretty easy to bring a spare battery in a pocket too. When I had my Canon with me on trips, I made the mistake of not having a sling pack or a strap for it, so there was a lot of hassle that I've now solved.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>In the last section, I mentioned bringing a spare battery. Usually digital cameras shoot for 250-400 shots between charges, but the GRIII seems to be on the low end of that scale. I've only gone through one charge so far over a few shooting sessions, but the copious warnings online about the battery life meant I immediately ordered a spare and keep it with me <em>just in case</em>. I got two Wasabi spares with a charger for cheaper than a first-party battery, and so far they seem to not cause issues. An incredibly convenient feature on the GRIII is that I can plug the camera body into a USB-C battery or my iPad to charge it up pretty quickly even if I'm not near a spare or a wall socket.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/grcables.jpg" alt="cables"></p>
<p>Whereas my Canon camera used micro USB like my damn Kindle (c'mon Amazon, put a USB-C port in the Kindle already), the GRIII uses a USB-C port like my computer and iPad, which means I only need to bring a single cable to charge any of those devices. I bought a USB-C to SD card reader as well, because it's pretty nice to take out the SD card, and plug it into my iPad after shooting, especially if I want to go somewhere else to edit photos without my camera. Ricoh also offers an iOS app to do remote shooting, or transfers, but the speed seems to be a little slow, so I would likely only use this feature in an emergency. Part of the appeal of a camera that <em>isn't</em> a phone is thoughtfulness and not rushing to get a photo onto my site or micro.blog, so having a little barrier there is relaxing.</p>
<p>Previously, I would've scoffed at this, but then the pandemic happened, and I reevaluated my relationship with Twitter after leaving Instagram a few years ago. Plus, my iPhone is totally fine still for joke photos if I some reactji on Slack.</p>
<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/menus.jpg" alt="menu"></p>
<p>There are a bunch of nicely resistant buttons on the GRIII, as well as a surprisingly-good touchscreen for the rest of the selections. I'm not sure what kind of processor is in this camera, but it's fast and responsive when I'm deleting, zooming, or changing settings. Additionally, it's as easy as thumbing the DISP button to cycle through screen options while shooting, including turning the screen off. I haven't used a ton of digital cameras, but this is easily my favorite menu system and settings selection.</p>
<h2 id="shooting">Shooting</h2>
<p>What's it like to actually shoot photos with the Ricoh?</p>
<p>In a word, fantastic.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/grflowers.jpg" alt="ricohphoto"></p>
<p>Between the incredibly quick startup, fast burst, and great lens, every time I want to shoot a photo I can do so easily. I don't mind walking to zoom, and am pretty used to it with my iPhone, so the 28mm lens is a delight. Even without a tilting screen, it's pretty simple to know what I'm shooting, and capture the image even without looking at the screen, especially with the snap focus option which lets me choose an automatic focus range for a full-press of the shutter button. I'd heard a little bit about focus hunting, but I've found that generally the GRIII finds faces and objects with ease. I also love mode selection ring with a lock, to ensure I don't accidentally revert to P or M when I wanted my own user setting—oh and there's 3 of those.</p>
<p>The video, as many other reviewers have stated, isn't very good, but if I want to shoot video (which is rare), my iPhone is just fine.</p>

<h2 id="the-verdict">The verdict</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/coolcat.jpg" alt="coolcat"></p>
<p>I love this camera. Between the quality of the photos, the feel of it in my hand and the generally indefinable <em>coolness</em> the Ricoh GRIII is with me pretty much any time I leave the house now. I can't wait to travel with it to Japan again, or even take it with me backpacking in the near future. If you like shooting street photography, or like me, just want to take photos of your cat and surroundings without notifications interrupting your walk, pick one of these up.</p>

I read some old journal entries today from the before times and it’s funny to see how much my life and activities were the same as they are now. When this pandemic is wrapped-up, I know I’ll appreciate a quick visit to a wine bar much more, at least for a few weeks. This week also marked the end of my second month of 3x a week workout classes, which I think is making a difference in my energy and emotional health.</description>

<p>Another weekend is upon us! Blessed weekend! It’s August, can you believe it?! I read some old journal entries today from the <em>before times</em> and it’s funny to see how much my life and activities were the same as they are now. When this pandemic is wrapped-up, I know I’ll appreciate a quick visit to a wine bar much more, at least for a few weeks. This week also marked the end of my second month of 3x a week workout classes, which I <em>think</em> is making a difference in my energy and emotional health. Have you gotten some exercise recently? Even some stretches can be nice, trust me. Either way, let’s both take a deep inhale&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and a big exhale.</p>
<p>There now, you’re ready for <em>these links</em>.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>This week marked the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2020-hugo-awards/">2020 Hugo awards</a>, which means if you enjoy sci-fi and haven’t read a ton this year, you’ll have quite a bit of excellent stuff to catch up on. My plan is to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Skin-Forward-collection-Jemisin-ebook/dp/B07VFMFPP4">Emergency Skin by N.K. Jemison</a> this weekend.</li>
<li>You may have heard about QAnon, the weird new conspiracy cult that popped-up over the past few years, but did you know how it’s <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/qanon-conspiracy-cult-losing-family">destroying families</a>? It turns out when you believe absolutely ridiculous theories, your friends and family tend to steer clear. I’m very curious, and more than a little scared to find out how this whole Q thing shakes out.</li>
<li>Listen, it might be a rather solitary fall out there, but there’s no reason for you not to look your best. <a href="https://tienda.baumm.com/us/camperas/">These jackets</a> are a great way to say “fuck it, I dress for me!”</li>
<li>If you’ve already read all the Hugo-nominated novels and novellas, perhaps you might want to follow BDG’s example and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEWEdIcx1DI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1381">drown your sorrows in Halo</a>. As a one-time reader of Magic the Gathering and Battletech novels, I think I’ll give them a wide-berth, but your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>This week marked the often bizarre (thanks a lot go-go juice) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/30/21346575/tech-antitrust-hearing-recap-bezos-zuckerberg-cook-pichai">anti-trust hearing </a>with the leaders of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. There’s a lot to worry about with the consolidation of power and influence in these tech titans, and <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/blog/issue-23-editors-note">I’m not the only one</a> considering how COVID isolation bolsters it.</li>
<li>Finally, I decided to pick up a <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iii">fancy new camera</a> to give myself even more reason to go outside and explore a little during this quarantine. It’s been pretty fun, even if most of the photos I’ve taken are of my cat, Snorri.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>With the summer dwindling and a very cozy fall in our near future, I hope you’re taking care of yourself, and stockpiling wool blankets and candles. I’m pretty excited for a few books and shows that will launch in the coming months, not to mention the rest of the F1 season still to come. I’m not fully sure what it’ll feel like to keep going with this largely self-quarantined life until next year, but we’ll all learn together, one week at a time. Take care, and enjoy a lazy Sunday for me, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;july&#34;&gt;July&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s midsummer here in Oakland, and due to the persistence of people’s risky behavior, we’re still very quarantined. At this rate, I might read quite a few more books than I initially imagined I would, as it could be well rinto 2021 before anything changes. I’m still watching quite a bit of TV, and the Formula 1 season that finally started. Seeing folks drive cars all over Europe is quite the treat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’m still watching quite a bit of TV, and the Formula 1 season that finally started. Seeing folks drive cars all over Europe is quite the treat.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Infomocracy</strong> — Malka Older</p>
<p>A very good re-read. In the lead up to the election, this feels appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhism for Beginners</strong></p>
<p>A pretty solid introduction formatted as an extended Q&amp;A that covers most ground related to how Buddhist teachings apply to our present time. I think I prefer the other book I read recently, but it was nice to have clarity on a few things I’d heard in teachings at sanghas.</p>
<p><strong>Because Internet: Gretchen McCulloch</strong></p>
<p>A delightful linguistic investigation into the history and present of internet culture, memes, and language. This felt somewhat similar to Lurking insofar as they cover a bit of the same territory, but I think this deeper dive into the language and communication styles that came from Old Internet People is a nice companion to that book. If you're online in any capacity, this is something important to read.</p>
<p><strong>An American Spy</strong> — Olen Steinhauer</p>
<p>Ah, I finally got to a volume I haven't read before—I loved the switch in perspective to the spymaster Zhu. I am pretty curious to see what happens in the final Milo Weaver book, especially with a few years separating it from this hopeful book. Generally, this series felt light enough to get through quickly, but fun, and meaty enough to really sink into during that time.</p>
<p><strong>The Nearest Exit</strong> — Olen Steinhauer</p>
<p>Apparently I read this book before in 2010, but I've definitely slept since then because most of it was still a surprise to me. The saga of Milo Weaver gets even more twisty in this volume as he tries to quit his job and fix his family. Definitely wishing I could do some traveling of my own after these two spy novels.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhism Without Beliefs</strong> — Stephen Bachelor</p>
<p>A few years ago I started going to a sangha regularly and meditating a lot. While I haven’t kept up with the practice regularly, mediation is a pretty awesome part of my life when I’m able to do it, and I’ve enjoyed the lessons of the four noble truths and eightfold path. The bits of capital B Buddhism I wasn’t amped on were the religious bits, so it’s interesting to read about an agnostic buddhism.</p>
<p><strong>My Soul to Keep</strong> — Yrsa Sigurdadóttir</p>
<p>Another cozy mystery with the lawyer Thora. This went on a little long, but was still twisty enough to be interesting. In a world of Nordic noir, it’s kinda fun to read something where the protagonist isn’t a cop.</p>
<p><strong>The Tourist</strong> — Olen Steinhauer</p>
<p>A fun spy novel with plenty of twists and a good take on &ldquo;the spy that tried to get out&rdquo; trope.</p>
<p><strong>A Memory Called Empire</strong> — Arkady Martine</p>
<p>I have to admit I heard this author read at an event and her style was such I didn’t want to read this book for some time. However, I’m glad I got over that and dove into this fantastical world. Martine deftly wove together the foundation for a really neat space opera, with compelling characters, and a lot of meaty world-building. There was intrigue plenty, and I’m excited for the next book in September.</p>
<p><strong>In Praise of Shadows</strong> — Junichiro Tanizaki</p>
<p>A lot of this book (or possibly long essay) really holds up. I love all the bits about soft lighting and over-illumination killing mystery and beauty, but the parts of skin color and race are definitely not of-the-times. Tanizaki was a strange fellow, but I'm glad I read this seminal work.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Money Plane</strong></p>
<p>A true piece of crap. Everyone in this film seemed like they mostly work on Cinemax soft core films.</p>
<p><strong>Spectre</strong></p>
<p>A delightful rewatch.</p>
<p><strong>6 Underground</strong></p>
<p>Continuing my tradition of watching mediocre Netflix thrillers, I think I’m almost done with the current set. Ryan Reynolds is doing his sarcastic guy thing, and there’s tons of fast cuts and action stuff. The first action scene felt exciting for a bit, but by the twelfth hat-on-a-hat and shitty rock song I was hoping for relief. Fortunately it got better later, but I wish this’d been modeled more on Fast &amp; Furious and less on xXx. I wonder if Bezos watched this and thought “I’ve trained for this!”?</p>
<p><strong>Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Thor trades his hammer for guns in this exciting action film without much behind the action. Sometimes you need to watch stuff get blown-up without much plot.</p>
<p><strong>Time to Hunt</strong></p>
<p>Outstanding thriller that kept building and moving throughout. I saw this on a sci-fi list, but for the most part this felt like a slightly alternate reality, vs something in the future. Very fun.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Boys for Life</strong></p>
<p>This series is epically ridiculous, and fun throughout. Everyone seems to be having fun, and there’s a lot of wild action and even a surprise third act trip out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>The Old Guard</strong></p>
<p>Fun but ultimately thin action flick. Solid action near the end, but so much of it felt emotionless in a way that was just not super entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Greyhound</strong></p>
<p>Tom Hanks has a fantastic presence, but they don’t really develop many other folks in this tense battle movie. Which, hey, that makes sense, since the whole movie they’re just depth charging the shit out of the sea.</p></content:encoded>

      <description>Dill &amp;amp; Fennel 30 This weekend was pretty nice in the Shelley house—we started early by taking Friday off to volunteer for the Women’s Foundation (Snorri mostly yelled), and spent the rest of our time laying around (Snorri), and playing Good Sudoku. I’ve also thought about getting back into shooting photos and biking around, which could be a fun adventure. In preparation, I even picked-up a new camera, so expect better pictures of my cat and neighborhood soon.</description>

      <description>Fennel &amp;amp; Dill 29 Happy March 141st! Time continues to show up for me in the cycles of life—laundry, therapy, medicine, and plant watering. With news that most schools will open virtually in the fall, I get the sense that “summer” for kids will continue well into 2021, albeit without pool parties. It’s a weird, life-defining time. Snorri and I are weathering things well, and possibly even thriving. As my friend Lena said yesterday, “I’m an indoor cat”.</description>

      <description>Microposting After a few days of playing around with micropub and the indieweb (which seems to largely be from 2018 and 2019) I have a micropub server that works with Hugo and integrates with iAWriter. Hooray!
With the beta of iOS 14 I’ve had to heavily modify my publishing shortcuts, and while they’re pretty great, publishing directly through Micropub with the “publish” button in iAWriter seems even more convenient.
If you’re using Hugo or Jekyll, this is a good starting place, and only needs minor tweaks to exposed config values to work with most setups of either static backend.</description>

<p>With the wild social hacking incident on Twitter today, now more than ever it’s cool to own and control your own content. Outside of the cost of my editor, and my domain registration, I think I pay a grand total of $0 to Netlify for DNS, GitHub for hosting, or another web host for a few random services. Static sites are tiny, and IMO the only real cost is a few days to figure out some of the small caveats and customize your theme.</p>

      <description>Another week, and another Formula One race in Austria. For the first time in the over 70 year history of this race series two races occurred at the same track. The first race included loads of suspension and tire issues due to curbs, and this weekend included with a veritable lake on the track. If you’ve never watched car racing, I recommend Netflix’s excellent behind-the-scenes series. Outside of high speed racing, my week was a bit of a let-down, as I found out I didn’t get a position at work I’d interviewed for on Wednesday.</description>

<li>if you need something great to read during the quarantine, why not dive into this short fiction from Murakami <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/confessions-of-a-shinagawa-monkey">about a monkey</a>.</li>
<li>Building <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/chatbots-at-the-end-of-the-world-connolly">customer service robots while the world burns?</a> That’s par for the course in Silicon Valley. That, and continuously attacking a journalist for reporting on the industry. It would be pretty amazing if folks decided to work on global warming or other pressing global crises, but until then, I guess returning my yoga pants will be better.</li>
<li>I finished watching Berlin Station this week, and also decided to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olen_Steinhauer">the writer</a> of the show’s book series about CIA Tourists.</li>
<li>Does anyone know why it’s called “chankonabe/ちゃんこ鍋”？I can’t for the life of me find out the etymology of that dish. If you know, <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">hit me up</a>.</li>
<li>In honor of July 4th, do everyone a favor and read about the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/">racial wealth gap</a>. American capitalism is a pernicious force of white supremacy, and we’ve got to change things.</li>

<p>Thanks again for bearing with me this evening and being patient for these links. I hope your week is relaxing, and you are able to stay inside/social distance and avoid the spike of COVID that’s ravaging most of the states. Keep fighting, and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, summer! So much reading and a few movies while still hiding out inside from the continuing pandemic. I watched a few notable tv shows as well, like the 3rd season of Dark, and Berlin Station. Lots of comics as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Ah, summer! So much reading and a few movies while still hiding out inside from the continuing pandemic. I watched a few notable tv shows as well, like the 3rd season of Dark, and Berlin Station. Lots of comics as well.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>The Glass Hotel</strong> — Emily St John Mandel</p>
<p>An interesting twisty novel. This reminded me a bit of how David Mitchell constructs his plots, but slightly more straightforward. I wish we’d gotten a little more Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>The Summer Book</strong> — Tove Jansson</p>
<p>This was a delightfully banal book about a girl and her grandma on an island off the coat of Finland. All the small stories were a joy, and I imagine I'll return to this book often when I need a smile.</p>
<p><strong>The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning</strong> — Margareta Magnusson</p>
<p>It’s nice reading a book by an older woman who has such a clear love and appreciate for her life, but has accepted the inevitability of death. Far from being grim, this book was a delightful look at what we value and how to make sure no one else has to clean up our mess when we’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>Woman in the Dunes</strong> — Kobo Abe</p>
<p>Abe is one of my favorite authors, and consistently makes me smile with his surreal plots and characters. Woman in the Dunes is not my favorite of his, but is a fascinating look at how our spirit can be ground down by sand and society.</p>
<p><strong>Abolish Silicon Valley</strong> — Wendy Liu</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Capitalism Is a disease in the venality of Silicon Valley is a morbid symptom, the fingers turning ashen”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who is somewhat begrudgingly started working in Silicon Valley after studying literature mostly as a way to make ends-meat, this book resonated strongly. The front half establishes Liu’s history, but the back half is the juicy bit. I love reading a hopeful vision of how we might reconfigure society to support humans, and not capital.</p>
<p><strong>Last Rituals</strong> — Yrsa Sigurdadóttir</p>
<p>A solid Scandinavian noir with a nice amount of occult content. I think the translation could’ve likely used work, as some of the phrasing seemed oddly stilted, but I can’t read Icelandic to check up on that.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Bridge of Spies</strong></p>
<p>A solid Spielberg feel-good negotiation thriller. I only knew a little about the U2 bomber and our history of capturing spies until I watched this film and dove into Wikipedia. This movie made me miss Berlin, which I’ve only visited once for a few weeks, but was delightful. If you enjoy the work of Tom Hanks, he does his thing well in this movie.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini Man</strong></p>
<p>I can only imagine a certain “religion” has also cloned Will Smith at some point. This was way more fun than it had a right to be, and weirdly enough the young Will CGI was pretty solid. How long until we see movies with young Cruise, or Washington? Have a bottle of wine and turn your brain off for 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>‌式日</strong></p>
<p>This was a lot of movie. When I was younger I think I had more patience for particularly slow films, but I ended-up being a little distracted during 式日. I’m glad I finally got to watch it though, as it was pretty interesting seeing Iwai on the other side of the camera. Also I really miss being in Japan now.</p>
<p><strong>Waiting for Guffman</strong></p>
<p>Ah, a classic. It’s wild seeing Fred Willard in this looking so young comparatively. I watched this obsessively in high school and it really, really holds up.</p></content:encoded>

      <description>The bay this week was thankfully cooler than the past month. My body was thankful for the heat respite, and Snorri was cuddlier as a result. This week felt long, after having Juneteenth off last week, but next Friday we observe Independence Day, so it’s another short week. I can’t say I’m looking forward to the even more ubiquitous fireworks, but hopefully the cops will finally run out.
I spent a lot of time watching tv this week, and enjoying good Japanese Whiskey.</description>

I can’t say I’m looking forward to the even more ubiquitous fireworks, but hopefully the cops will finally run out.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time watching tv this week, and enjoying good <a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/ichiros-malt-and-grain-whisky/">Japanese Whiskey</a>. Hopefully you had some fun things to occupy your time as well. Oh, and I also spent an inordinate amount of time trying to fix my bike chain and rear derailleur—bike shops have 10 day waits, so needs must. I turns out I’ve forgotten most of my bike mechanic skills.</p>
<p>What skills have you forgotten/tried to learn?</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two more comics to start us off: <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/gideon-falls">Gideon Falls</a>, which is pretty damn creepy, and <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/adventureman-1">Adventureman</a>, which fortunately seems to be about a woman. The comics world is finally reckoning with predation and abusive men, which hopefully means even more great people will be able to produce content instead. Comics, other than distribution, seem to be ideally suited for quarantine creation, and it would be rad to see a new set of voices show up in print soon.</li>
<li>Speaking of fancy whiskey, before this quarantine Chinese and American customers were swiftly burning through the <a href="http://archive.is/sGUeM">stocks of all the greatest bottles</a>. I’ve heard from friends in Japan that it’s not even possible to buy a lot of great whiskeys there unless you know someone at the distillery. Production is likely ramping-up to meet demand, but it might be 5 or more years before we see the results. I plan to still enjoy Japanese whiskey then too. My favorite remains <a href="https://distiller.com/spirits/nikka-coffey-grain-whisky">Nikka Coffey Grain</a>, except when I’m in Japan and can consistently get this <a href="https://distiller.com/spirits/nikka-taketsuru-pure-malt-17-year">17 year delight</a>.</li>
<li>I dove headlong into a new tv show from HBO Europe this week: Beforeigners, which was as fun and silly as the name. Ostensibly, it’s a detective show, but the primary conceit is that folks keep popping up in the ocean from ancient Norse villages. I learned about a lot of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russefeiring">strange</a> rituals and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorir_Hund">characters from Snorri’s book</a> Heimskringkla. I also love that Vikings called Jesus, <a href="http://vikinganswerlady.com/hvitkrst.shtml">“the white christ”</a>. Showing up in a new country and saying “this is your new religion” is a total dick move, in my opinion. I wonder if any sci-fi about this exists, wherein aliens pop down to earth to convert everyone to worship space Hubbard?</li>

I think I’m likely drinking more than usual, but maybe that just balances out everyone else who apparently can only drink at bars.</li>
<li>On Friday night, I was waxing rhapsodic about the magazine Giant Robot (RIP), and then decided to check out what they’d blogged about since shutting down their print run. <a href="https://www.giantrobot.com/blogs/giant-robot-store-and-gr2-news/poston">This piece</a> by Eric Nakamura about his dad, Bob, returning to the internment camp he was forced into by xenophobic and racist white Americans during WWII was sad and beautiful.</li>

<p>Well, it’s time for me to return to my world of tv amateur bike wrenching, and <a href="https://womensfoundationoforegon.org">funding cool non-profits</a>.

      <description>Like most of the folks who marginally to maximally care about Apple stuff, I watched WWDC today from my house on my TV. Our work chat was going wild throughout, especially during the bits about the ARM transition over the next few years. Overall, I felt like this was an excellent set of announcements, handled in a fun and entertaining way despite the remote nature. Also shout out to Craig&#39;s bold chest-hair revealing sartorial choice.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Like most of the folks who marginally to maximally care about Apple stuff, I watched WWDC today from my house on my TV. Our work chat was going wild throughout, especially during the bits about the ARM transition over the next few years. Overall, I felt like this was an excellent set of announcements, handled in a fun and entertaining way despite the remote nature. Also shout out to Craig's bold chest-hair revealing sartorial choice.</p>
<h2 id="ios-and-ipad-os">iOS and iPad OS</h2>
<p>The biggest UI update in a while brings homescreen widgets. I'm excited to see what third-party developers do with this feature, as right now it's mostly just Stocks or Music on my screen. Also the delightful App Library means I can finally remove most of my homescreen apps, though for whatever reason it's not possible to remove Fitness or Watch.</p>
<p>Global search feels faster, and more consistent, with a nice non-fullscreen view on iPad that makes cmd+space feel like the best bits of Alfred. As far as I can tell, there aren't any major changes to apps like Mail though, and unfortunately the announced ability to change default apps isn't in the first beta.</p>
<h2 id="mac-os-11">Mac OS 11</h2>
<p>They finally did it! We have progressed past 10.xx.xx to the wonderful world of 11. I worried we'd just keep going endlessly in Mac OS 10, so I'm thrilled they moved forward. The visual differences between 10 and 11 thus far feel significant enough to warrant an entire number shift, with cool transparency and just a general <em>modern</em> vibe to the whole OS.</p>
<p>Gone is the strange slide-over menu that had notifications and widgets, and in it's place is a widget-only view that has stock Apple apps currently. There's also a control center similar to iPad or iPhone that makes it possible to dismiss Bluetooth and Wifi, as well as battery icons, Airplay, and brightness, making for a more streamlined menu bar.</p>
<p>Default error and trash sounds all changed, which is interesting. It's initially confusing, as someone who's used the Mac since the start of OS X, but I think I like the new sounds a bit better. I'll keep my audio unmuted for a few weeks and report back.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;I dunno about this&rdquo; column: all of the icons for widgets as well as apps got awkwardly skeuomorphic again. I'm curious to see if the design of these apps and icons changes at all before this fall.</p>
<h2 id="arm">ARM</h2>
<p>It's hard to say how the ARM transition will shake out, since it's largely going to take place over the course of the next two years, but personally, I can't wait to buy an ARM MacBook or MacBook Pro. I'm typing this on my 2018 MacBook 12&rdquo; that I dearly love, and I don't plan to replace my personal Mac until I can also ditch Intel outside of work. I think transitions like these are cool opportunities for smaller developers to really shake things up, so I sincerely hope that Indies do a great job of unseating some of the incumbent software makers. The idea of running iPad software on my Mac is kind of exciting, especially for things like Overcast, where it makes little to no sense for a single developer to make an app for 3 platforms. I remain optimistic, but skeptical.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I think today's event checked all the boxes I had for &ldquo;fun stuff&rdquo;, and even surprised me with a few little bits and pieces. The next big event should be in the fall, and that's likely when Mr. Cook and company get a lot of my money for their shiny new hardware. It was also pretty neat to watch this virtually with a bunch of folks from work—it almost felt like we were in the same place again for an hour and a half.</p>

      <description>It’s a foggy, overcast Saturday as I write this newsletter. Yesterday, my company gave Juneteenth off as time to volunteer and remember, and I spent most of the day with the Women’s Foundation of Oregon discussing budgets and our COVID relief fund. As a Texan, I grew up hearing about Juneteenth, but still hadn’t fully understood Texas as “part of the south” until a few years ago, since Austin had firmly insulated itself from owning our history.</description>

Take some time to read about Juneteenth, and why its the real Independence Day for our country.</p>
<p>(Insert picture of Snorri)</p>
<p>My good friend Snorri stood on my shoulder for this part, so I figured I should add a photo of him saying hi. Do you have a pet? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Send me a photo</a> of your pet being cute. I’m heartened by how many friends have adopted pets during this quarantine, and it feels like almost every week there are new cats showing up in our cats channel at work. I’m still studying how Snorri handles being permanently shelter-in-place for tips on how to deal with COVID. Mostly, it seems like the key is naps and purring.</p>
<p>Let’s get to the links!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>These <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/how-i-got-my-attention-back/">two</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/six-weeks-100s-miles-hours-glorious-boredom-japan/">essays</a> from Craig Mod are a very interesting look at attention and hiking. If you’re anything like me, it’s pretty hard to look away from the constant pull of the news and minute-to-minute narration of current events Twitter brings us every day. I’ve still largely stuck to my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-02-22-a-twitter-experiment-using-rss-to-readonly-twitter/">RSS Twitter diet</a>, which I still recommend, but I still load the news up on Google or Apple a few times a day. It’s super important to stay informed, but I think it’s worth thinking about the cycles of meaningless scrolling we all get into.</li>

<li>The man above makes what I call “BeEDM”. I’m fascinated by the combination of shed-made electronic music, with beekeeping. If bees aren’t your thing, you can instead <a href="https://www.midisprout.com">make music from your plants</a>. Honestly, I think it’s hard to beat music that cats make.</li>

<li>Robin Sloan is on a roll lately! This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2020/05/conspiracy-museum/610984/">piece in the Atlantic</a> was a delight, and he’s also serializing some fiction in the local paper every day too. The guy also makes a <a href="https://fat.gold">pretty solid olive oil</a>, which I received yesterday for the first time, and immediately poured on my sourdough.</li>
<li>I planned to send a few comic recommendations, but one of the folks who I’ve been reading lately was revealed to be a predator this week, so I’ll only give you one recommendation. The creator of Blade of the Immortal has two new series, and one of them is all about female assassins: <a href="https://kodanshacomics.com/series/die-wergelder/">Die Wergelder</a>. It rules. The other series is on my to-watch list, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave,_Listen_to_Me">anime just aired</a>.</li>

<p>Well, the clouds have parted, and Saturday is looking sunny and nice. I think after I take today’s loaf out of the oven, I’ll go on a bike ride with a few friends at a distance and maybe pick up <a href="https://fieldworkbrewing.com">some beer</a>.

<li>I wish William Gibson was a little less prescient sometimes. <a href="https://thequietus.com/articles/28340-william-gibson-agency-interview">This interivew</a> with the author talks about his latest work, and the eeriness of his writing about “the jackpot”. I recently reread Gibson’s Blue Ant trilogy, which was coincident with a growth in stealth brands, surveillance culture, and AR. I think it will ultimately hold up a bit better for me than the Peripheral or Agency, but it’s nice to see him still so masterfully creating fiction.</li>

<li>With some good music queued up, let’s read about <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/software_slump/">slow software</a>. I don’t agree with everything Craig concludes here, but I appreciate his digging into what makes software good and bad, and the thread he started of software folks enjoy. I sincerely hope that WWDC in two weeks brings ARM chips to the Mac, and with it, better speed and battery life. Times are rough in so many ways, but there’s still a surprising amount of interesting technology being released and neat software to play around with too.</li>

In a lot of ways, I think I miss the time where sites were static, and the social net was IRC, forums, and email. I’m curious to see what the next ten years looks like: what is Web 4.0?

<li>On Friday, I wrote about my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-06-12-stoked-on-survivor/">newfound love for the tv show Survivor</a>. It’s a very silly show, but powering through seasons is giving me a lot of joy right now.</li>

      <description>After twenty years of this CBS reality show being on TV, I finally jumped on board as a fan. A few years ago, a podcast I enjoy discussed a John Siricusa’s longstanding love of Survivor, and even offered a list of his favorite seasons. I dipped a toe in with one season, then promptly decided that was enough, until March brought a shelter at home.

<p>Until the being stuck inside this year, I had only seen season 37, David vs Goliath. Growing up I thought Survivor and most reality tv show was garbage, and instead watched a lot of auteur film and highbrow dramas. I can’t say that Survivor is high-brow, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised at the strange subtleties of its comedy, and the joy of a weird cast of characters. My friend Drew, who bought me the Cameo above, was the person that finally tipped me over the edge into being a fan. He’s got great silly taste, and our near-daily chats about this show are a balm in this time.</p>
<p>When you watch Survivor, it turns out there’s a lot to get sucked into: constant politicking and a mix of grim and utterly bizarre challenges every episode. Too often folks end up very badly injured, and need to be sent home for their safety, which I could do without. I think they do a good job of having medical staff, but I still worry someone will eventually die on this show. However as an effort to convince the viewer that this competition is grueling, folks suffering in the rain and sun and other scenes of misery are effective to say the least.</p>
<h2 id="the-format">The format</h2>
<p>Survivor is an often Machiavellian social game, albeit with occasional gaffes. There are <a href="https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor_Rulebook">official rules</a>, and throughout the years you can watch the show staff figure out strange edge cases during an episode.</p>
<p>Every season begins simply with 20 people from various backgrounds, chosen by the producers (save for one season) for their potentially compelling stories. They usually start from a boat, or a helicopter as they’re abandoned on a tropical island or deserted location. Most seasons then break the contestants down to two or three groups, occasionally with a silly theme like “brains vs. beauty vs. brawn” that can feel a little contrived. Every episode these “tribes” compete for a reward, and immunity from voting a member of their group out. As the seasons progress, Survivor adds in strange twists, like immunity idols, fire tokens, and an exile island. Some seasons are truly entertaining, with a great cast, and shocking twists. Others, I’m told, are very boring.</p>
<p>As the season continues, there is usually a shuffling of tribal membership, and eventually a “merge” of the tribes for the final ten players. There are meals from various fast-casual restaurants, prizes from weird big box stores, and people nearly crying from the chance to have a soda. It’s hugely entertaining tv.</p>
<h2 id="winning-it-all">Winning it all</h2>
<p>Different styles of players win each season, which means I’ve often found myself guessing until late in the season who might take home the cash prize. Sometimes, it’s someone physically strong, but often it’s the clever social butterfly, or conniving “villain” that doesn’t mind betraying everyone. The especially fun twist at the end of every season is that the last 8-10 people voted out of the show by their tribes vote for the winner from the last 2 or three contestants. Play too dirty, or too vindictively, and survivors run the risk of alienating their judges.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-all-white-guys">Is it all white guys?</h2>
<p>Recently, the show has grappled with its own sexism and prejudices a bit more than usual, and hopefully in future seasons women can seen in a more positive light for doing the things men are rewarded for every episode. With a very odd mistake of making a “race war” season, the casting tends to be somewhat diverse, and includes queer and trans characters occasionally as well. For CBS especially, this feels impressive—though I think that’s perhaps a low bar. Folks do tend to dislike cops on the show, which honestly checks out.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-watch">How I watch</h2>
<p>I recommend not googling any season you’re curious about too hard, as there tend to be spoilers. In my quest to watch “the good seasons” after watching the 20th anniversary season Winners at War, with only previous winners playing, I found <a href="http://www.purplerockpodcast.com/survivor-season-rankings-spoiler-free-summaries/">this spoiler-free list</a> of all forty seasons, ranked by quality. At this point, I’ve watched most of 9 seasons, and am working through Fans vs. Favorites as I write this. A few seasons offered spoilers through their “redemption” theme, but in general that list has worked well for me thus far.</p>
<p>If you can handle the SD quality of the first season, it might be nice to start right at the beginning and meet the character that made fun of my CSS earlier in this post. Richard Hatch is a whole wild story, but don’t look him up until you’ve seen at least the first season. If something more modern and HD is up your alley, David vs. Goliath was a nice starter for me, and offered a lot of entertainment, and Cagayan (Season 28) also left me laughing more often than not.</p>
<h2 id="give-it-a-try">Give it a try</h2>
<p>Ultimately if you’ve thought, like me, that Survivor isn’t worth watching, I recommend challenging that notion. Sure, it’s not the smartest thing on TV, but as we sit inside indefinitely, with limited options to visit islands of ourselves (unless you live on one), this is prime action and escapism for this time.</p>

      <description>This is my eleventh week in quarantine, since I was in Japan when the Bay Area shut down. COVID is still scary, but it’s been an even harder week due to police violence against black Americans, murdering multiple people and assaulting countless more. Fuck the cops. Fuck the violent, racist state.
With that said, I will go ahead and share some links, as usual, with a few that may help you grapple with what’s happening right now.</description>

      <description>Before March I rarely baked. Outside of a few misadventures as a kid, I’d mostly made hand pies, and a few loaves of pulla, but bread was mostly beyond me. Just like the yeast that seeded Carl, my starter, sourdough making was in the air. My favorite sourdough baker Acme’s loaves became hard to get from Berkeley Bowl a few weeks into the quarantine, so I decided to follow along with everyone else, and get way too into bread making.</description>

Outside of a few misadventures as a kid, I’d mostly made hand pies, and a few loaves of <a href="https://www.feastingathome.com/pulla-for-lea/">pulla</a>, but bread was mostly beyond me. Just like the yeast that seeded Carl, my starter, sourdough making was in the air. My favorite sourdough baker Acme’s loaves became hard to get from Berkeley Bowl a few weeks into the quarantine, so I decided to follow along with everyone else, and get way too into bread making.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/boule2.jpg" alt="best loaf"></p>
<h2 id="starting-with-starter">Starting with starter</h2>
<p>I managed to snag a little flour and using a simple <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/">starter recipe</a> from the internet I began to grow a jar full of friends. For the first week or so, I think I had the temperature wrong, because all I managed to do was get a lot of <a href="https://truesourdough.com/sourdough-starter-troubleshooting-your-questions-answered/">hooch</a> without much of the expected doubling.</p>
<p>After lots of googling, I realized the key was not only keeping the starter in the oven with the light on, but also literally discarding most of it every time I fed it with fresh flour. Ratios, it turns out, are very important. I settled on 30g of water, and 30g of wheat flour ever afternoon, and before much longer, I was getting a lot of activity.</p>
<h2 id="finally-bread">Finally, bread</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/firstloaf.jpg" alt="first loaf"></p>
<p>My first loaves weren’t anything to brag about, but they were vaguely edible. I began to make bread before I really settled on a good recipe, and definitely before I had an active starter, so they were flat and dense. By my 4th loaf, I was approaching something I recognized as bread, and by my 6th, I was consistently getting a decent rise and crust. The biggest lessons during this time were around using my cast iron with and without a lid, and figuring out how to do timing so that I wasn’t trying to bulk ferment until 2am.</p>
<p>Timing would be a lot more challenging if I had to go to an office every day, so potentially I’ll have to really figure it out when I’m back to commuting next year. I’ve seen a few helpful tools for determining timing, but if I stay deep into the bread game, I might be waking up a lot earlier in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>With some hobbies I’ve gotten into the tools of the hobby way before I had any real talent or experience doing it. For baking, I started with very little. I had a 6qt Lodge cast iron pot, some dish towels, and a few metal bowls and glass jars, and that was it. No couché, no lame, no bench knife, and no banneton. As I kept making loaf after loaf, I quickly learned why bakers use these tools.</p>
<p>I struggled every loaf with stickiness, as unbeknownst to me, <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/best-sourdough-recipe/">my recipe</a>, which was a modified Tartine one, was very high-hydration. I ordered a banneton first, then rice flour to help coat it. next I added a large couché to my kitchen island for resting after bulk fermentation, and covered it in a dusting of wheat and rice flours. Everything go much easier. Finally I added a lame, which is basically a razor blade on a stick, to make cuts that turn into gorgeous bread valleys in the oven that allow the loaf to expand without tearing.</p>
<p>My kitchen still doesn’t include a bench scraper, but since I mostly make single loaves, that’s worked out ok. Once I learned to work with my dough with wet hands, I didn’t deal much with stickiness either. When making high-hydration recipes, folding and light touch are your friends—no kneading needed.</p>
<h2 id="the-little-things">The little things</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/boule.jpg" alt="less spring"></p>
<p>After 10 or 12 loaves I started learning the small things that could compromise my loaves. Dropping proofed dough too hard into a cast iron can blow out air bubbles, which hurts the oven spring. For my fridge at least, I need to let my dough sit out for at least 5 or 10 minutes or it’s too cold going into the oven, which also hurts spring. A friend recently mentioned how every recipe has to be tweaked for <em>your</em> kitchen, and the seasons and temperatures, and he was super right. As we get to Bay Area summer, I can already tell I won’t need the oven to bulk ferment, and my starter will activate <em>fast</em>. Every little thing reminds me that this bread is a living creature, enlivened by a colony of yeast that I guess I now have a symbiotic relationship with.</p>
<p>Ultimately, bread is amazing, and I’m so happy I started making it. Long live the sourdough yeasts. Long live Carl.</p>

      <description>It&#39;s been a busy week! At my company, we had Monday and Friday off, and most of our staff took off the entire week. I decided to work through the week for some reason, and ended-up getting a lot done! Suffering from a bout of creative excitement, I also redesigned my site to try to beat the Google performance measure and load fully under two seconds. Yes. I&#39;m a frontend pervert.</description>

I decided to work through the week for some reason, and ended-up getting a lot done! Suffering from a bout of creative excitement, I also <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-05-30-blog-redesign/">redesigned my site</a> to try to beat the <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">Google performance measure</a> and load fully under two seconds. Yes. I'm a frontend pervert. At one point I almost ditched the entire site and rebuilt it in <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/css/">CSS grid</a>, but cooler heads prevailed (I got a little drunk and decided to just finish the redesign instead).</p>
<p>Did you know we have a <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Marina_Home/">cool marina</a> near our IKEA? My pal André showed it to me in a socially distant bike ride, and it's super fun to ride to, despite the slightly crowded trails. I'm trying to balance my desire to never leave the house with my need for exercise, so we'll see how many times I head to the marina in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I hope you're also not leaving the house much, but you do you.</p>
<p>Here's some <em>links</em>!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>I think it's summer now? It's definitely hot, and so I've started reading more Scandinavian fiction to keep the heat low in my head at least. Let's dive into the <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-summer-book/9781590172681">world of Tove Jansson</a> together, shall we?</li>
<li>Whether you're baking a lot now or not, I bet you don't know what makes b<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/what-is-the-difference-between-baking-powder-and-baking-soda-in-pancakes.html">aking soda and baking powder</a> different.  There's your exciting cocktail fact for the week.</li>
<li>I'm hiding this one 3 links in to try to fool a friend (hi Drew) into <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">reading it</a>. It's all about making Google Fonts faster, and since I know you all love performance fuckery, you'll get a kick out of it.</li>
<li>Every time I return from Japan, I think &ldquo;why do our trains suck so much?!&rdquo; In comparison with most of Europe and Asia, the United States lags far behind on train transport, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lawmaker-wants-fast-trains-rev-us-economy/">perhaps not for long</a>. I really hope I get to see high-speed rail in the states while I'm young.</li>
<li>Finally, here's America's number one Merlin <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/7593305-merlin-mann">talking about his favorite Elliot Smith</a> song.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a lot less fun link excavating this week because&hellip; well, have you seen the news? All I'll say about it is: Black lives matter, and cops should be held accountable for their atrocities &amp; Section 230 makes the social web work.</p>
<p>I hope you have some time away from the horrors and sad things of the world, and can take care of yourself, your family, and your friends this week. I'm rooting for you, and I'll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another month of quarantine means a few movies and books. I also dove into a freshly delivered pile of Monocle and played way too much CoD: Warzone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I also watched something like 5 seasons of Survivor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Another month of quarantine means a few movies and books. I also dove into a freshly delivered pile of Monocle and played way too much CoD: Warzone.</p>
<p>I think I also watched something like 5 seasons of Survivor.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Network Effect</strong> — Martha Wells</p>
<p>It’s nice to really stretch my legs in the Murderbot world. I hope Wells writes more novels in this fun universe, and we get to see Murderbot grow further past its general emotional discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Finna</strong> — Nino Cipri</p>
<p>A fun romp through an IKEA multiverse with a queer couple and a missing grandma. I had fun with this, and the short length meant I blazed through it almost too fast. I hope there’s more from Cipri soon.</p>
<p><strong>Zero History</strong> — William Gibson</p>
<p>I read this slowly to really savor it. The last book in the Blue Ant trilogy is the most oddball and fun, but always comes with the knowledge that I won’t get to adventure with Millgrim and Hollis again until I reread the series yet again in the future. It’s fascinating how thoroughly Gibson identified the coming brand drops, denim obsession, and obsession with quadrocopters. As a sage of the near future, he feels unparalleled.</p>
<p><strong>Spook Country</strong> — William Gibson</p>
<p>A delightful reread of a really fun Gibson near-future/near-past adventure. There are so many moments in this book that make me super jealous I didn’t conceive of them. The Blue Ant trilogy owns bones.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Nightmare on Elm Street</strong></p>
<p>Did you know Depp was in this? I certainly didn’t! This is the second movie I’ve watched because of the podcast <strong>The Scaredy Cats</strong> wherein one host of Reply All tries to help the other host inure himself to horror films. With all of the cultural cachet this movie had, it was interesting to see how quickly they showed Freddy himself. Freddy also seemed shorter than I imagined. I also always find it funny when all the “high school” actors are in their twenties. Why not just set it in college?</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade</strong></p>
<p>An interesting take on the post-human world. It’s a schlocky, funny, gory AF film, and not very into its own violence. Also it was rad to see Betty Gabriel from Get Out again.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong></p>
<p>Weird how much more low-key enjoyable this was than the last movie I watched. From the delightfully bad puns, to Jim Carrey having way too much fun, to Ben Schwartz just being himself, this was a nice Saturday afternoon romp. I went in expecting basically nothing, and was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p><strong>The Dead Don’t Die</strong></p>
<p>This movie so badly wanted to be clever, it is the film equivalent to wearing a “funny shirt” from Hot Topic and explaining the joke to everyone before they can even laugh.</p>
<p><strong>The Lodge</strong></p>
<p>One of the better horror films I’ve seen in a while, with a very scary house, and an excellent secluded location.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday Night</strong></p>
<p>A fun documentary with rather overwrought camera-work that shows what preparing for and shooting SNL is like. It’s kinda wild to see the sheer number of writers and staff that make it come alive.</p>
<p><strong>The Exorcist</strong></p>
<p>Pretty creepy, with great special effects considering the time. I always root for the demons in any one of these, and definitely wondered while watching this how many more kids priests hurt than these imagined evil spirits. The devil, it turns out, was the church all along.</p>
<p><strong>Vivarium</strong></p>
<p>Started creepy, got way creepier. I appreciate the unwillingness to tell the viewer what the fuck is happening. This plays out like a great Ursula K Le Guin novel.</p></content:encoded>

      <description>My personal site started off as a way to keep track of books and movies I’d read and watched outside of the world of Goodreads or other ad-based sites. I’ve lost lots of data in the past, and ultimately it’s just much easier to keep text portable and backed-up when it’s a .txt or .md
In the ensuing years, I’ve written a few blog posts, and listed tons of books and movies but I hadn’t done much with my site’s structure or design besides moving my static site generator from Jekyll to Hugo on a whim last year.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>My personal site <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/why-i-built-a-markdown-book-blog-a07e1a6dd163">started off</a> as a way to keep track of books and movies I’d read and watched outside of the world of Goodreads or other ad-based sites. I’ve lost lots of data in the past, and ultimately it’s just much easier to keep text portable and backed-up when it’s a <code>.txt</code> or <code>.md</code></p>
<p>In the ensuing years, I’ve written a few blog posts, and listed tons of books and movies but I hadn’t done much with my site’s structure or design besides moving my static site generator from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> on a whim last year. I can’t say that I like Go templating any better than Ruby, but I can struggle through both of them. With a site publishing workflow that automatically builds and deploys from Github using Github Actions, I’m set on the backend front, and decided to give my front end skills a dusting-off from my days in CSS 1.0 land.</p>
<h2 id="a-start-at-design">A start at design</h2>
<p>My initial foray into the design of the site was just to use an off-the-shelf theme called <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/ezhil/">Ezhil</a>, which worked pretty well for a while. Sure, there were creaky bits, and a lot of extraneous things I didn’t care for, but it was easy to install, and use, so I went for it. Hugo and Jekyll, and even <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> (if you’re a JS person) have dozens of fantastic themes and templates from folks far more talented at CSS than myself, but I’ve found my site doesn’t feel like it’s mine until I’ve done some under the hood tinkering.</p>
<h2 id="a-long-week">A long week</h2>
<p>With a three day work week, I got the jones for change. I’d tweaked the initial theme a bit to iron out features I didn’t like, but ultimately I think I made a bit of a mess of the site until now. Inspired by <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/redesign-wrapping-up/">Frank Chimero’s long redesign process</a> I decided to radically simplify my site, and try to get a total load time of under two seconds. I accomplished both of my goals, but I have a way to go before I’m fully happy with the type and margins. Fortunately, I learned a lot o CSS tricks along the way, and even dipped my toes into CSS Grid in <a href="https://github.com/brookshelley/brookshelley">another repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fonts--hierarchy">Fonts &amp; hierarchy</h2>
<p>For this 2020 version of my site, I moved to <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/quicksand">Quicksand</a> as my sans-serif, and decided to add <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-serif">Source Serif Pro</a> to make reading longer content like this much easier. As someone who is very much <em>not</em> a designer, I <em>think</em> the two go together ok, but hopefully my actual designer friends will give me feedback at some point to save me from any <em>fauxnt pas</em>.</p>
<p>For header elements, I tried to let them breathe with a big top and bottom margin. I couldn’t stomach the full 4em that Frank Chimero uses on his site, but 2em felt nice enough, especially on my iPhone. Since I was regularly testing this site on light and dark modes, on my iPad, MacBook, and iPhone, I was able to work out a lot of responsive kinks along the way.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m happy I figured out most of the margins and centering CSS amongst the tangle of elements. While I was dealing with my site’s code, a friend reminded me “hell is other people’s CSS,” and that will ring in my head until I inevitably replace all of the elements and classes in <code>main.css</code>. It’s frustrating not always knowing what changes will actually be reflected in the browser due to confusing nested values. More on this in the future along with potential font changes.</p>
<h2 id="simpler-menus">Simpler menus</h2>
<p>In his redesign blog, Frank talked about removing his reading and music lists by relocating them to <a href="https://www.notion.so/Reading-Log-3341e831fc744130bf536a54cd79ec56">Notion</a>. This isn’t a terrible idea, and I definitely like the added simplicity of his menus because of it, but my priority remains holding onto plain text versions of my lists, so that’s out for me. I thought about ways of auto-populating them when I write my media diets, but outside of a few ideas around templating I have stuck to manually copying over items for those posts. Perhaps there isn’t a need for media diets and exhaustive lists to exist? For now, I’ll keep the two lists in my top level nav, with secondary links in the media diet section.</p>
<h2 id="light-is-fast">Light is fast</h2>
<p>To hit my goal of an under two second load time, I gutted a few javascript files, before realizing I didn’t need them at all. Instead of <code>feather.min.js</code>, I just inlined the few SVG icons I wanted, and threw them in my footer partial. Bingo bango.</p>
<p>I dug into my CSS file and tried to remove everything that’s not necessary, and during the aforementioned margin struggle that meant dozens of lines of code. I also managed to bring down the total site size by 10s of Mb by using <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">Image Optim</a> to do what it says on the tin. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/automating-image-optimization/">This post</a> is a really great read if you want to dig further into image optimization, or learn just how bloated your site might actually be.</p>
<p>At the end of all of my optimizing and spring-cleaning, I hit 1.9s of load time, with a responsive design that works in light or dark mode (though light mode doesn’t get SVG icons yet because I got sleepy). I’m pretty proud of the <a href="https://lighthouse-dot-webdotdevsite.appspot.com//lh/html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookshelley.com">results I got on web.dev</a> at the end of all my hard work, but I still need to sort out a more efficient caching strategy for a few odds and ends.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I re-learned that in the year 2020, the fastest way to build a website is still to use mostly static HTML and CSS, and ditch the JavaScript completely. Web fonts are still weird, though it turns out doing <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">preloading</a> can help a bit with speed. Hopefully I’ll figure out a few more things about margins, padding, and site hierarchy as I keep tweaking this design, but I’m pretty happy with how it looks so far.</p>

      <description>Welp, first sunburn of the quarantine for this gal. I spent the afternoon in a friend’s yard (hi André and Haley) and forgot my skin has been softened by indoor lighting for months. On the upside, it was gorgeous outside, and I’m glad I got to sit in the sun.
Since I’ll be indoors for a while healing-up, a lot of todays’s links are indoor kid interests. So if you’re like me, I think you’ll enjoy these:</description>

<p>Since I’ll be indoors for a while healing-up, a lot of todays’s links are indoor kid interests. So if you’re like me, I think you’ll enjoy these:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, here’s a <a href="https://www.girlwalkallday.com/chapters-page">gorgeous dance movie</a> that I’ve had on my to-watch list for a while. It’s surreal to watch right now, since it involves a lot of public contact and even a subway ride in NYC, but it’s a nice reminder of the fun times.</li>
<li>Next, lets do a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-guide-to-dune-s-strange-and-intense-religions-1843460283">deep-dive into the religions of Dune</a>. I personally love the oddball Bene Gesserit, and one of my regrets of my previous startup selling to another company is our next code sprint title series could’ve been Dune names. Alas.</li>
<li>If reading about Dune makes you want to ship some of the characters, make sure you don’t make them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html">awkwardly lupine</a>. There’s a lawsuit brewing at the intersection of fan fiction and self-published ebooks that will help establish case law around shared universes. I get t feeling the Omegaverse (read the above to know more) will stay open to all.</li>
<li>This next one is a twofer on grammar. Why do we <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/all-your-questions-about-pronoun-deletion-and-the-inexorable-death-of-the-universe-answered.html">delete initial pronouns in English</a> lately? And how does that same deletion <a href="https://nihongoperapera.com/dirty-japanese-guide-subjects-and-deletions.html">function in Japanese</a>? I journal quite a bit and speak Japanese decently, so I’ve run into this concept of deletion and assumed context sentences often. I think it’s a pretty fascinating concept.</li>
<li>Here’s something else to watch: <a href="https://kotaku.com/8-great-anime-series-for-people-who-don-t-like-anime-1843616852">anime for folks who haven’t seen anime</a>. I’ve seen quite a few if these and can vouch for them.</li>
<li>Finally, let’s talk “warshers” and “diddles” in the <a href="http://www.washers.org/terms.html#diddle">most high-stake professional sport in America</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This image is care of Joe—thanks Joe! It’s an emoji keyboard from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/gph0lk/alps_kanji_keyboard_exotic_peripherals_week/">Reddit on strange peripherals</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.redd.it/3vs4r3ci8m051.jpg" alt="keyboard"></p>
<p>Well, that’s it for this week. I’ve spent a lot of this weekend already playing a silly war game with friends, and it’s highly likely I’ll keep that going. More bread making as well. I hope you have a chill short week, and don’t randomly set off fireworks like all my neighbors&hellip; yikes.<br>
See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Trying out a new name for this that isn’t just “links”. Fennel and dill are two of my favorite flavors, but also a terrible combination. They also happen to be my utterly bizarre chest-piece tattoo. If you follow this newsletter but haven’t ever met me in person, just know I have a lot of botanical tattoos.
My snacking game is strong now that I know how to make my own tortillas on demand, and endless sourdough.</description>

<p>My snacking game is strong now that I know how to make my own tortillas on demand, and endless sourdough. However, it’s been a while since I had some of these little treats, and I am officially missing tater tots:</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll try to cook some up sometime. It seems pretty challenging though. Putting this on a list that also includes homemade lefse and ableskiver.</p>
<p>Do you <em>you</em> like refrigerators?</p>

<p>I love the <a href="http://www.cc.com/shows/detroiters">Detroiters</a>-level excellence of this ad. It’s utterly brilliant to just show the man I presume owns the shop slowly walking towards the camera. This is cinema.</p>
<p>If that wet your whistle, let’s dive in for a full link immersion.</p>

<p>Perhaps videos aren’t your thing, and you’re more of a reading fan. Reading is my favorite thing, and one of my only consistent hobbies, so it was awesome to find <a href="https://lithub.com/26-books-from-the-last-decade-that-if-you-havent-read-you-should/">this list</a> via <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com">Robin Sloan</a> of excellent books you’ve likely not read, recommended by authors who are also rad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you still managed to avoid the siren song of Animal Crossing? I keep oversleeping/baking instead of buying turnips, so unlike some people I know, I’m not yet in a post-money economy. I’ve got bills to pay! Even still, I find this quarantine-time <a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1261295269338992640?s=20">live playing of the theme song</a> just delightful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m a big Formula 1 fan, which you might not know, but one of my least favoriting things about it is the lack of women driving in the sport. Luckily, there are efforts to sponsor and develop professional drivers, and I hope eventually Formula 1 teams and sponsors get over their misogyny and have <a href="https://wseries.com">some of these awesome women</a> drive in the most prestigious series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, deep into quarantine I’ve continued to bake up a storm, and I think this is my best boule so far!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/boule.jpg" alt="boule"></p>
<p>I’ve got another one in the oven this morning, and I hope it turns out well. Also if you’re the sort of person who practices witchcraft, or otherwise wants to send some good vibes my way&hellip; Friday could be very interesting. Hopefully I can share more, and it’s good news. Short version is I’m trying to do something very neat at work.</p>
<p>I hope however you spend your next week, it’s a good one, and as always, I’ll see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Ten loaves of sourdough! That’s how many loaves I have made thus far during the pandemic (or pan-demic if you’ll excuse my pun). Have you found a fulfilling hobby? Gotten really good at a driving simulator? Taken up amateur plumbing? I went out last weekend for the first time, albeit just down the street to sit in a friend’s yard, far from said friend. It was pretty nice, and I keep thinking I should perhaps do a little more biking and walking, but then I see a dozen people walking around massless, and I get some combination of furious and scared all over again.</description>

<p>Here’s hoping this week’s links will give you some chill times, and maybe even some laughs instead. Here’s some mood music:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you miss clubbing? Just getting hopped up on some fundrugs™ and shaking your booty in hopes you might get to swap spit with a cutie? Well, sans the spit bit, you might be in luck if <a href="https://www.core77.com/posts/98066/No-Social-Distancing-Required-Personal-Protective-Suit-Concept-Designed-for-Nightlife">you can make one of these</a>. I love this bonkers concept, because it imagines a world in which people are somehow ok with wearing spacesuits to go to a bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think any friends have taken me up on this, but I for sure wish they would try to cut their own hair with a shop vac. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-my-hair-with-a-vacuum-cleaner-and-oh-man-i-think-1843204420">I love it</a>.</p>

<p>If the previous song is over, here’s a bit more mall music to tide you over as you read these next few pieces:</p>

<li>The fantastic essayist Rebecca Solnit covered everything from pandemic profiteering to the hope that we come out of this with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit">greater respect and understanding of our interconnectedness</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process.</p>

<p>Here’s so music to bring you back from the depths that essay may have taken you through:</p>

<p>Finally, I want to leave you with the single best video series I’ve seen in a while—a cat sleeping on a piano while their owner gently plays, the hammers massaging them.</p>

<p>I hope these links have brought you some joy, and led you through a few interesting paths. I’m off to enjoy Sonic the Hedgehog in preparation for listening to this week’s Flop House. You can follow along with my cinematic misadventures <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/movies">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.letterboxd.com/brookshelley/films/">here</a>. If it’s sunny today, try to sit by a window or go on a chill socially distant walk. I went on my first bike ride since February yesterday, and though it was short, it really helped me feel a little more ok. It’s hard to remember, at least over here, that despite this feeling like forever, it’s only been two months. For how ever much time we have in lockdown, I’ll keep sending emails to you every week, and keep on baking very, very surprisingly good sourdough. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Happy May! We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you&#39;re well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer.
I&#39;ve been cleaning, rearranging, and making lots of bread—I think I&#39;ve finally sorted out my Sourdough woes.
One thing I can recommend for anyone looking to clean up a little are a bunch of little velcro strips to manage those cables.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Happy May! We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you're well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer.</p>
<p>I've been cleaning, rearranging, and making lots of bread—I think I've finally sorted out my Sourdough woes.</p>
<p>One thing I can recommend for anyone looking to clean up a little are <em>a bunch</em> of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Reusable-Fastening-Organizing/dp/B001E1Y5O6">little velcro strips</a> to manage those cables. These little fellows are super versatile, reusable, and the package will probably last the rest of your life. What value!</p>
<p>If you haven't installed a desk and a nice office chair yet, I can heartily recommend doing so. I was sitting at my dining room table until Friday, on a modern but unsupportive kitchen chair. Ow. Now I have a Herman Miller Sayl, and a cool little desk to keep my stuff away from the &ldquo;food zone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As we go through this week, I hope you have as much energy as all these cool ladies:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCO0DXAc0tk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Cool, right? Here's some links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you like memes? Do you like AI? <a href="https://imgflip.com/ai-meme?fbclid=IwAR2Z87afCI_yG2HsTyRgoa1yp5MytCPW2OB-X_TkttmJegoHnYp9BGolTg0">Boom</a>. Someone put these two forces together, and it's an eerie laugh riot. A coworker never really understands memes, so I can't wait to just start sending him these.</li>
<li>Did you know Jia Tolentino is younger than me? I sure didn't! I haven't read Trick Mirror yet, but she's pretty damn cool, I think. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jia-tolentino-interview-trick-mirror-962686/">This interview</a> gave me a lot of insight into her world, and more interest in picking it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next few links are related to a mindset for quarantine and the pandemic. Don’t worry if you feel like skipping them. I found them supremely helpful, but your mileage may vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it seems that <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2020/04/take-the-long-view/">taking the long view</a> on terrible events may help us put our own suffering and frustration in context. Terrible things have happened to so many of us, and more will happen in the future, but the span of time we’re alive is vast compared to these months of difficulty.</li>
<li>As a life post-pandemic begins, we should “prioritise people and societies, ecologies and environments, ahead of profit and productivity.” It’s not only possible for us to use this global crisis as a catalyst, I believe it’s absolutely vital. There is no “normal” to return to, because “normal” was always fucking terrible for millions. Let’s build a world we will be proud to hand off to the future inhabitants of Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I blogged about this before, but there’s a whole troupe of bloggers doing a regular column over at <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/">Indoor Voices</a>, but one of the coolest ones is Coffeecore:</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ob-X-j_hHS8/XqkGuwjkc1I/AAAAAAAAK4w/oGC5MO2D6QkSBCvIzp_zH5uQjmeqW109ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/sailorroundwindow.gif" alt="coffeecore"></p>

</div>

<p>Whether or not you like coffee, <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/2020/05/coffeecore-on-city.html">this story</a> will get you out of the house and sipping iced lattes, cups of black drip, and other delights in your mind.</p>
<h2 id="comics">Comics</h2>
<p>During this copious indoor time, I’ve enjoyed reading quite a few <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/books">books</a>, and a bunch of graphic novels, manga, and comics. Unfortunately, Marvel and a few other publishers decided to pause a number of series like <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/decorum-1">Decorum</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/injection-volume-1/9781632154798">Injection</a>.</p>
<p>If you need a few volumes to read during this pause, I recommend these three:</p>
<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/die-volume-1-fantasy-heartbreaker/9781534312708">Die</a>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/city-1/9781945054785">City</a>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/books?keywords=Dorohedoro">Dorohedoro</a></p>
<p>Also, all the new X-Men Dawn of X/House of X stuff is great as well, but those series are stuck on issue 10 until Marvel sorts out their single distributor issue.</p>
<p>Are you reading anything great? Any old favorite manga or graphic novels I should check out? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Let me know</a>. I hope the coming week is full of small pleasures, and delights. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>My first entire month in quarantine. Plenty of time to read, watch movies, and play Civ 6 (and keep losing). I also picked-up Gran Turismo and raced virtual cars for countless hours. This month felt like a year.
Books Polaris Rising — Jessie Mihalik
A mix of space caper and Harlequin Romance, there was entirely too much straight sex in this for me. But, if you think “space operas should have more picking out dresses and rough hands on waists,” then this is the book for you.</description>

<p>A mix of space caper and Harlequin Romance, there was entirely too much straight sex in this for me. But, if you think “space operas should have more picking out dresses and rough hands on waists,” then this is the book for you.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Sum Game</strong> — SL Huang</p>
<p>Ah a female protagonist who uses her math expertise to leap through windows and shoot bad guys! This book ruled. I’m not sure what this character’s “struggle” is going to be, because in the first book at least she’s a little invincible, but either way it was fun.</p>
<p><strong>The Factory</strong> — Hiroko Oyamada</p>
<p>A strange, short book with some challenging dialogue formatting. I really loved the small vignettes of slightly-slanted banal work life in The Factory. I'm excited to read more of Oyamada's work, because despite reading quite a bit of Japanese fiction, I haven't had the chance to read very many Japanese women. I hope that I either get better at kanji to the point I can read from the source, or more translators translate other women.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>After the Storm</strong></p>
<p>Koreeda is one of the best directors when it comes to presenting the sadly funny banality of life. I can’t fathom someone else who could present a deadbeat dad and dysfunctional family with such pathos. This isn’t quite as heartrending as Shoplifters, but it comes close.</p>
<p><strong>Game Night</strong></p>
<p>Just a good time. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and it hopped along at a good clip while keeping me laughing.</p>
<p><strong>Hustlers</strong></p>
<p>I love a good grift. I’m still low-key mad this wasn’t about a lesbian romance between J Lo and Constance Wu though.</p>
<p><strong>Jumanji: Next Level</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to see the Rock play Dan Devito? What about Jack Black playing a younger black guy? This movie was more bizarre than the last but hey, it was also fun.</p>
<p><strong>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</strong></p>
<p>The extras’ costuming in this film is deeply strange, with a mix of “Indiana Jones pan-middle-east” and “Mad Max”. This whole film was a glorious mess, and I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>The Guest</strong></p>
<p>This was surprisingly funny and very bizarre. I really enjoy Dan Stevens, ever since his turn as Xavier’s son Legion.</p>
<p><strong>Prisoners</strong></p>
<p>In preparation for the eventual release of the new Dune film I wanted to familiarize myself with Villneuve’s ourve. This is a very good mystery film with a grittier Gyllenhal than his turn at Zodiac.</p>
<p><strong>Rythym Section</strong></p>
<p>A training montage revenge flick that slowly transforms into a pretty thrilling action movie.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodshot</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t mind the scars, I just don’t like the stories they tell.” With a time-to-tanktop of just under 5 minutes, you know from the jump this will be a new Diesel vehicle. This movie had it all: underwater tai-chi, weightlifting, Guy Pierce, and a drinking competition to hone in on Vin’s favorite shot. Of course, as a Chinese-financed movie, there’s no blood or sex or skeletons. Also why didn’t they put that one guy’s eyes in his head instead of on his chest?! “He’s a techie, just like me!”</p>
<p><strong>Radius</strong></p>
<p>Interesting conceptually, but it didn’t really go anywhere besides the concept. It would’ve been better as an anime, lol.</p>
<p><strong>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</strong></p>
<p>Well, fuck. That was gorgeous and sad. This movie built until my heart ached, and wove a story of falling in love.</p>
<p><strong>Crawl</strong></p>
<p>It’s no Underwater, but I guess if you want to see a great reason not to visit Florida, this is a perfect anti-ad.</p>
<p><strong>Underwater</strong></p>
<p>This turned out was cooler that i was expecting. Can’t say much more without spoiling anything.</p>
<p><strong>General Magic</strong></p>
<p>After seeing the fictionalized versions of many of these folks in Steve Jobs, and hearing so many stories about others—some of whom I’ve met—this was a really interesting look at a company that catalyzed much of what we use every day to live online.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>
<p>Oh, hey, it’s Shiv! It’s kind of fascinating that the entire story is told through the lead-up to the presentations that implanted Steve Jobs in so many of our brains. I really enjoyed seeing this, and also think it’s funny this came out only 2 years after the Kutcher film. Also, Fassbender has a way cooler vibe that the actual Jobs&hellip; I mean, he’s Magneto!</p>
<p><strong>The Social Network</strong></p>
<p>One of the wildest things about this movie is the that Facebook’s valuation at the time of the credits rolling was only $25 billion. A few years later, it’s nearly 500 billion. I left Facebook 3 years before this film came out, and briefly returned while in Portland. I get the sense the characters in the film might be less likable in real life.</p>
<p><strong>Apollo 13</strong></p>
<p>Such a fantastic film. It’s surprising how well this held up, with many practical effects and no terrible CGI. It’s been 25 years and this one still had me on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p><strong>Overlord</strong></p>
<p>This felt a bit like a video game. Lots of nazis getting blown up? Weird underground lab? Strange NPCs? Check.</p>
<p><strong>Birds of Prey</strong></p>
<p>It’s a low bar, but this is definitely the best DCU movie since all the serious Nolan Batman films. Not only was it silly fun, it managed to build interesting characters and solid battles that put the overwrought CGI-fest of Avengers to shame. I hope if they make more of these they keep the formula. I really want to see a love story between Poison Ivy and Harley.</p>
<p><strong>1917</strong></p>
<p>A very intense movie but it was also beautiful in its own way. I get why this won awards. Weird cameo by Doctor Strange though.</p>

<p>In other news, my company has extended our work from home until at least September, which means I’m going to see so many more movies, and play so much Gran Turismo. I think Snorri will also be stoked to have a human pillow for longer.</p>
<p>I’ve been cooking a lot since getting back from Japan, and this week I made a lot of fresh tortillas, which it turns out are <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/simple-tortillas-recipe">very, very easy to make</a>. If you want them to even better, you’ll have to invest in lard.</p>
<p>Had enough tortillas? Here’s some dessert:</p>

<li>First, here’s a long video that explores how we ended-up in our precarious economic condition. Spoiler alert: our capitalism isn’t working:</li>

      <description>Watching friends and reviewers get their new Magic Keyboards in the mail all week was brutal, because every word I read about them, and video I watched just made me want to touch one more. In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.
In a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.</description>

<p>Watching friends and reviewers get their new Magic Keyboards in the mail all week was brutal, because every word I read about them, and video I watched just made me want to touch one more. In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.</p>
<p>In a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="heavy">Heavy</h2>
<p>My first thought when I took the Magic Keyboard package out of the mailbox was, “yow, this <em>is</em> heavy.” After taking the keyboard out of its packaging, the heft remained, but once I attached my iPad to it and started typing, I forgot all about the weight. Sure, this will be a bit heavier for travel, but the modularity is worth it for me. I can’t wait to type on this while traveling, then pull the iPad off the keyboard to carry around for reading in a park, or watching a tv show. It makes me wish it were possible to pull the screen off of my work computer and walk around with it too!</p>
<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>
<p>Ever since getting the Smart Keyboard, my iPad basically never left it. I carried my iPad around daily, fingers pressed into the keys awkwardly on the back of the screen. The previous keyboard for the iPad was also super strange in its own way, but looking back, having a primary iPad case expose you to the keyboard buttons constantly when all you want to do is read is so silly. This new Magic Keyboard makes no concessions to using it while <em>not</em> typing. The ease of removing the iPad from the keyboard (I’m almost tempted to call it a dock) is such that I don’t even think about taking my iPad with me to another room, sans keyboard. This mode-changing makes the iPad feel even more futuristic than it did before, especially because my hands are only now becoming accustomed to the thin, metallic body of the iPad, instead of the strange rubber skin of the keyboard case its lived in up until now.</p>
<h2 id="thunk">Thunk</h2>
<p>So, what’s the keyboard actually like to type on?</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Unlike most folks, I really enjoyed both the butterfly keyboard in my MacBook, and the cloth-covered one on the Smart Keyboard. I enjoyed the short-travel, and the weird texture, but the feel and thunk of this new keyboard is even better. I don’t really care about the backlighting, and I’m a little bit more concerned about the gaps that invite in stray drops of water, but as I mentioned above, I don’t plan to carry this with me all the time, so it’s more likely I’ll have a glass of wine sans non-waterproof keyboard, and keep drinks away when I plan to <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>I typed this review on the new keyboard, and the experience was absolutely fantastic. The new trackpad <em>is</em> small, but the ability to quickly laser-target my edits is a delight. No longer do I have to tap, stab, tap tap, arrow, arrow, arrow. I can just point, and click, and voila. When I’m not at work, I more or less <em>only</em> use my iPad, and this new keyboard means the typing I do will be faster, feel better, and even sound more pleasingly thunky.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-it">Should you buy it?</h2>
<p>Do you type on your iPad? Do you want to? Have you been tempted to plug your iPad into a monitor and use a Bluetooth trackpad? Do you love writing on the go?</p>
<p>If so, then this is probably the right keyboard for you. If you only occasionally reach for your iPad to watch YouTube videos, or are the kind of person who thinks traveling with an iPad <strong>and</strong> a MacBook is totally acceptable, then save your $300. In the same way that I’ve never purchased an Apple Pencil, many iPad users will never purchase this keyboard, and I think that’s totally fine. But the folks that do buy one, and get to experience the entirely wonderful experience of typing and editing will be incredibly satisfied, I think.</p>

      <description>This week marked my first sourdough loaves, which were delicious and a bit flat. It turns out having a scale is crucial, and hopefully next week I will get to address that lack. I also got a few of my hobby shipments in, which meant building a tiny Porsche and beginning a small robot. Being stuck indoors all day alone is a great excuse for rediscovering things I enjoyed when I was a weird shut-in kid.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>This week marked my first sourdough loaves, which were delicious and a bit flat. It turns out having a scale is crucial, and hopefully next week I will get to address that lack. I also got a few of my hobby shipments in, which meant building a tiny Porsche and beginning a small robot. Being stuck indoors all day alone is a great excuse for rediscovering things I enjoyed when I was a weird shut-in kid. I feel super lucky most of my hobbies involve being alone indoors, save for driving, which I also enjoyed this weekend in an undisclosed touge road.</p>
<p>How’s your week? I hope you too have been finding hobbies to tide you over, and tv shows to binge. I’m back on my Terrace House habit again, mostly so I can co-watch with friends (hi Mehan and Soleil). It’s sad knowing the filming is paused due to the pandemic, but hopefully one day we’ll get new episodes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all I can give you is a few links a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if you want to follow in my LEGO footsteps, you might enjoy <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/speed-champions">these little cars</a>. They’re pretty quick to put together and showed me how far sets have come since I was a kid.</li>
<li>What makes <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/how-did-x-become-the-most-edgy-letter">the letter ‘X’ so horny</a>? That’s right, we went from LEGO to the horniest bit of the alphabet. The history is rather religious, and somewhat surprising. Let’s not forget about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_X_syndrome">triple-x syndrome</a> or the most important XXX of all time:</li>
</ul>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<ul>
<li>If you’re my age, you likely remember when we were banned from citing the internet in papers, especially the dreaded online encyclopedia <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-online-encyclopedia-best-place-internet/">Wikipedia</a>. Fortunately, it kept getting better, and is now a fantastic place to learn a bit and find primary and secondary sources for all sorts of wild stuff. I’ve had friends engaged in edit wars over famous trans video game characters, and many other topics. If you’ve never had the chance to go down a Wikihole, I recommend you just start clicking inside of articles, and don’t stop till you get hungry. It’s a fun maze to lose yourself in.</li>
<li>This week I learned about two important memes: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/russian-butt-slapping-championship">Russian Butt Slapping</a>, and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slapping-bags-of-soil">Soil Slapping</a>. It turns out you can slap a lot of things, but butts and soil are probably the best. I hope one day we can all slap someone’s butt competitively again.</li>
<li>Remember <a href="http://sidetalkin.com/">Sidetalkin’</a>? <a href="https://overcast.fm/+W3OaQhh3s">Panic sure does</a>. The nineties were so weird.</li>
<li>Finally, here’s a short story about <a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_11_15/">cooking during a pandemic</a>. It was written way before this whole think kicked off, and was eerily prescient.</li>
</ul>
<p>How're you keeping busy? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> and let me know! This weekend I'll make more tortillas, watch more Terrace House, and finish building my small robot.</p>
<p>Stay safe, get some sun, and see you next week space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Welcome to your weekly installment of “what’s Brook reading and clicking on now?” The quarantine here in the Bay Area is 4 weeks on, I think, and today I briefly saw a friend outside while dropping off groceries. It was nice. I hope you’ve had some distant human contact this month too. I’ve also been buying wine from Ordinaire, along with various tinned fishes, because this shit sucks, but wine and mackerel are delightful.</description>

It was nice. I hope you’ve had some distant human contact this month too. I’ve also been buying wine from Ordinaire, along with various tinned fishes, because this shit sucks, but wine and mackerel are delightful.</p>
<p>Also delightful? <em>Detroiters</em>—a show about a small Detroit advertising firm by Tim Robinson, also know for <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>. I’m savoring this show, but tonight I watched an absurd episode that was all about riding that hog.</p>
<p>I found out last week after a few somewhat failed photo links that my setup blocks “hot links”, something that one reader (hi Drew) commented on with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“lol, wild that that’s enabled by default? Is hotlinking still an internet crime in 2020?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hereby swear to avoid hot linking, unless it’s a lovely chorizo.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s get down to it: here’s the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I often find myself with little chunks of text, links or errata that I need to store temporarily, or add too here and there. Luckily, there's now <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps-were-trying-tot/">an app for that named Tot</a>. It's not a notes app, per se, but more like ephemeral sticky notes. I created a global shortcut, so I can always throw things into Tot, and sharing it out, or copying it elsewhere is super simple. If you work with strings, links, or junk, this is a great app. I haven't put it on my phone at this point, but I also feel less need to store things that way on iOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of random junk, do you find outdoor advertisement to be annoying? In my opinion outdoor ads are the shitty banner ads of the real world, and I wish they didn't exist. There's <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/the-growing-global-movement-to-end">a global movement to ban them</a>, and I really hope somehow they succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week I spent some time thinking about <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54202/weird-history-pogs">Pogs</a>, those little milk-caps that folks who're in their mid-30s fell in love with as kids. It turns out their history is more complicated than I thought, but I'm still unable to find out if there was a regulation slammer size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's a brief plug for very good coffee that shows up in your mailbox: <a href="https://www.yesplz.coffee">YesPlz</a>. I have consistently enjoyed this stuff ever since my old boss (hi David) turned me on to them. The beans come from a guy named Tonx, who previously ran a coffee service with the same name. Previously I bought Ethiopian beans from Four Barrel or Sightglass, but YesPlz has taken over as my only coffee supplier, especially during this pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that you're hopped-up on caffeine, time to do <a href="https://howlowcanyourlogo.com">some terrible work</a>. That's right, it's a competition to make a shitty logo. I've done a few of these in the past, and I really, really love making nightmarish designs. Here's what I came up with:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week's long read is about my favorite Swedish-speaking Finnish lesbian cartoonist, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/inside-tove-janssons-private-universe">Tove Jansson</a>. If you haven't ever read Moomin, I highly <a href="https://shop.moomin.com/collections/books/books-books-in-english">recommend it</a>. There are tv shows as well. Often overlooked, but a real treat, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Play_(novel)">her novels</a>.　I'm also low-key fascinated by how obsessed Japan is with Moomin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that's given you a few weird places to play online for the next week. How're you doing? Are you up to anything cool or fun? <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> and say hi if you feel like it. As always, stay healthy and happy—see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>This week I spent some time thinking about hoarding.
Specifically, toilet paper hoarding. I&#39;ve yet to venture out this week to the grocery, but the TP situation in my house is on its way to dire. I was able to procure napkins a week ago, so&amp;hellip; needs must.
The only hoarding I&#39;ve managed to do, back when it was just called &amp;ldquo;collecting&amp;rdquo; was of alcohol. I&#39;m a little proud of my strange Shochu collection, largely enabled by my friends over at Umami Mart (who&#39;re still doing curbside pickup in the East Bay, btw).</description>

<p>As you can tell from the photo, I'm prepared. You can also tell that Snorri is quite glad I'm constantly around right now, since he gets a 24/7 warm body to sleep on, and climb on. He's only demanded things a few times.</p>
<p>Much of this quarantine has felt similar to my normal life, albeit with a touch more agoraphobia than usual. I spent a lot of time when I wasn't at work sitting at home in the <em>before times</em> and I'm fortunate it's to my liking. I guess I miss seeing people occasionally, or going to restaurants a little, but we'll see if even I hit my limit. I spent around 4 years leaving my house minimally when I lived in Portland, and now I also have the aid of a therapist and medicine, so.</p>
<p>If your situation is different or tougher, I send you my love and a 6m distant hug. I know a few folks who're sick right now, and I hope they heal up again quick.</p>
<p>If you're like me, you're online a lot right now to distract and entertain yourself, so I will do what I can to add some levity. Here's the links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can you <em>believe</em> it's been 30 years since <a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/pages/search-results-page?collection=shadowrun&amp;page=1&amp;rb_product_type=Rulebooks">Shadowrun</a> first launched? Frankly, I'm a little shocked. This is a bit like those &ldquo;Nevermind came out longer ago from now than Led Zepplin's II&rdquo; for me. I've only played a handful of games in those 30 years, because it seems hard to convince folks <em>not</em> to play D&amp;D, but I spent hours and hours reading the second-edition sourcebooks when I was a kid. Yes, I was the kind of child that read RPG sourcebooks alone. I still do.</li>
<li>Keeping things in the <em>past</em> I present to you an <a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch">emulator of the original NEXT browser</a> brought to my attention by <a href="www.craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> during a private live-streamed design of a website he did yesterday. I think it's a bit cool how many folks have started ambient live-streams of various activities. It feels like a very low-key way to hang out with people.</li>
<li>Another blast from the past—wow this week—is You Look Nice Today. They've <em>returned</em> with <a href="https://www.californiaking.org">California King</a> and have stayed funny and delightful. I don't think I'd seen much of Scott since the old days of YLNT, but I'm always down for <em>yet another</em> Merlin man joint. If you decide to listen to the archives of YLNT, perhaps keep in mind that they've grown a bit as people, and you might hear some less than ideal content in the old ones. Que sera sera.</li>
<li>During a foraging session, I managed to buy some whole wheat starter, but no yeast. No matter, I've begun to make a <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/">starter</a>. This feels a little prairie home for me, but I'm looking forward to <em>more bread</em> because going out to buy fresh baguette every few days is not a good quarantine habit, I've found. I'll report back on the bread in the future.</li>
<li>Finally, I share with you a regular &lsquo;ol blog from <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/">a few writers similarly stuck into their homes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to those of you who've emailed me in the past few weeks to chat or comment on the email! I really love reading stuff from y'all, and will try to reply back most of the time. I know folks who've subscribed are a bit scattered around the globe, so it's nice to get the chance to catch-up through the asynchronous magic of email and RSS. If any of you keep a blog or have a newsletter, definitely let me know. I'm logging off for now to go watch the second season of Ozark and whittle down a bit of that shochu collection. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Books Empress of Forever — Max Gladstone
A fun space romp with a Jobsian lesbian protagonist and a strange cast of characters. This quickly shifts into a very different book from what it starts as, but I still loved it. More space lesbians, please.
A Song for a New Day — Sarah Pinsker
Welp, my second book for the month was another plague book, albeit one that largely took place in the aftermath of a pox.</description>

<p><strong>Empress of Forever</strong> — Max Gladstone</p>
<p>A fun space romp with a Jobsian lesbian protagonist and a strange cast of characters. This quickly shifts into a very different book from what it starts as, but I still loved it. More space lesbians, please.</p>
<p><strong>A Song for a New Day</strong> — Sarah Pinsker</p>
<p>Welp, my second book for the month was another plague book, albeit one that largely took place in the aftermath of a pox. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, even if it was a <em>little</em> too hopeful for my usual taste. Honestly, it was a little refreshing to read a book where cool women make music and care about each other, and hope for the future. Thanks Haley for the tip on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Wanderers</strong> — Chuck Wendig</p>
<p>Phew, that was a dark fucking book. With the pandemic going on in the world right now, this wasn’t a very good idea to read, but I’m glad I finished it. Just about every bad thing you can imagine happens in this book, so I have a hard time recommending it, but perhaps for folks who don’t believe in global warming or in the danger of a pandemic, this will give them pause.</p>
<p><strong>Lurking</strong> — Joanne McNeil</p>
<p>A very interesting look at the history of the internet as a user. One of the best non-fiction books I’ve read in a while.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>The Martian</strong></p>
<p>Another rewatch. I had a FaceTime call where my friend Lena and I discussed Halt and Catch Fire, which reminded me how much I enjoyed this film, which I took to be about the competence of McKenzie Davis’ character. This was my first time watching this movie in 4K though, which made it look pretty amazing. Also, I always forget Donald Glover was in this.</p>
<p><strong>Skyfall</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the only movies to use a Land Rover Defender in a car chase, this is pure fun. The filming and action scenes were a wild step-up from the previous two films, and the stakes felt high throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum of Solace</strong></p>
<p>Far less memorable than Casino Royale. The first chase was fun, but a lot of the rest of the film kinda just meanders. I do appreciate the little nods towards older James Bond films though.</p>
<p><strong>Casino Royale</strong></p>
<p>Rewatching this in preparation for the eventual release of the final Daniel Craig bond film. It holds pretty well, save for the hilariously old-looking Sony phones and bootcut khakis. I’d forgotten Mads Mikkelsen was in this.</p>
<p><strong>Contagion</strong></p>
<p>I saw this in the theater when it first came out, but I haven’t seen it since then. This felt like a timely movie considering our current circumstances. I forgot Jude Law plays a weird crank reporter.</p>

      <description>Ah, I’ve returned to the Americas. This week, Japan started quarantining as well, so I just missed the cutoff there and was largely able to enjoy wandering around like usual. I still tried to socially distance while I was in Tokyo and Osaka however, and I even blogged about it in five parts. Overall, it was a strange trip, but a fun one. I hope I get to travel back to Japan again in November after the quarantine ends.</description>

I still tried to socially distance while I was in Tokyo and Osaka however, and I even <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/">blogged about it</a> in five parts. Overall, it was a strange trip, but a fun one. I hope I get to travel back to Japan again in November after the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-social-distancing-over-back-to-normal/608752/">quarantine ends</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you’ve been enjoying your time at home, with your loved ones and pets, or if you’re still going in to work, thank you for helping take care of the rest of us. I went grocery shopping today, and everyone was thanking the employees for their service the whole time, which was nice to hear. I sincerely hope this whole thing leads us to believing in socialized medicine for everyone, because this most certainly won’t be the only medical crisis we face in the next 50 years. Hopefully if you’re reading this, you also agree.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that you’re stuck at home, maybe you can try <a href="https://www.flowbee.com/Questions.htm">cutting your own hair</a>. My entire childhood included haircuts from my dad in the garage with one of <a href="https://haircut.com/products/clear-model-by-robocut-1040-w-power">these</a>. I hated the sound of the shopvac, but I suppose it saved us money as a family. We were definitely style innovators in the 90s.</li>
<li>Jenny wrote this essay before the quarantine, but it’s certainly more true now than ever that we’re <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/01/15/the-myth-of-self-reliance/">unable to be self-reliant</a>. We’re all in this together, it turns out.</li>

<li>I write most things these days on an iPad, and the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro/">2020 iPad Pros just launched</a>. Whether I’m traveling, or sitting at home with my iPad plugged in to a monitor, it’s an amazing computer. With the launch of iOS 13.4, Apple reinvented the mouse cursor in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-trackpad-cursor/">whole new, fun way</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ipad_home.jpg" alt="my iPad at home"></p>
<ul>
<li>While I’m at home, I’m rediscovering some nerdy teen hobbies, like <a href="https://newtypehq.com/products/hg-msz-006a1-zeta-plus-unicorn-ver?variant=14548538327089#">Gunpla</a>. Despite a #gunpla channel at work, I’d resisted the siren song of plastic models until I faced the prospect of months alone at my apartment. I’m kind of excited to have some time to really devote to reading and making tiny robots.</li>
<li>I’ve got a big queue of books to get through, and this week I’m enjoying the sci-fi <a href="https://www.maxgladstone.com/writing/empress-of-forever/">tale of a lesbian tech CEO</a> which I’m reading along with my book club. It’s a fun romp through space with a strange cast of characters.</li>

</ul>
<p>It’s scary out there, so I hope you’re staying safe and managed to find some toilet paper amidst the bizarre hoarding. It’s too bad more bathrooms here don’t have <a href="https://washlet.totousa.com">washlets</a>. Maybe you’re watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acTdxsoa428">Tiger King</a>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/03/coronavirus-trolls-world-tour-invisible-man-the-hunt-emma-debut-on-demand-in-home-theatrical-window-collapse-1202884570/">hoping more films go straight to Netflix or Apple TV</a>, or just collecting as many bells as you can to pay off that bastard Tom Nook—however you spend your week, keep washing your hands, and checking in with your loved ones. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about my time in Asakusa.

<h2 id="last-day-in-asakusa">Last day in Asakusa</h2>
<p>What was supposed to be my last day in Asakusa started late. The combination of tiredness and a very comfortable bed meant I slept in until 1pm. I played Animal Crossing for a while, then went to get ramen.</p>
<p>Later, I headed to Kamakura to meet up with <a href="https://www.craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> who showed me around his neighborhood, and chatted with me about the world, design, and reading. It really changes the nature of trips abroad when you have friends in various cities, I’ve found. I’m lucky to have a few friends scattered around Japan, so I’ve got a few mini-trips I can take each time I visit. Hopefully I’ll get to see Craig again in November for his writing retreat in Yoshino. I’m pretty excited to do a lot of hiking with him and the other participants.</p>
<p>That night, I said bye to Craig, then got ramen at a Michelin-starred spot in Kamakura, then headed back to Tokyo for some fried chicken and conbini chuhai. I caught up on tv, then got to bed on the early side.</p>
<h2 id="real-last-day-in-asakusa">Real last day in Asakusa</h2>
<p>I woke up, packed, and got coffee downstairs. I took my time because I had to kill 6 or so hours until my flight home. A coworker (hi Ricky) met up with me at Fuglen in Asakusa to get coffee and chat about the state of the world for a while, and then I introduced him to the joy of Lemon Chuhais before we parted at the subway.</p>
<p>After a brief misadventure at the wrong airline terminal, and some confusion about whether or not my flight was cancelled, I made it into the airline terminal, and found a window seat at the airline lounge. Shockingly, they had Georgian orange wine on tap, so I definitely enjoyed my last few hours before my flight.</p>
<p>The flight was bumpy as hell, but I managed to sleep for a bit.</p>
<p>And now, I'm home&hellip; quarantined like the rest of California.</p>

Previously, I wrote about my time in Onomichi.</em></p>
<h2 id="yakitori-party">Yakitori party/焼き鳥のパーテイ</h2>
<p>After a drink at my hotel’s bar, I got a hot tip to check out a yakitori place a ten-minute walk away. I threw on my coat, and walked over, enjoying the peace and darkness of a city that actually sleeps.</p>
<p>The place was called 鳥徳 or Toritoku, and immediately on entering I was befriended by a Brazilian guy and his partner and their older math teacher friend. We talked for a while about tattoos, and drinking, and I mostly kept up in Japanese, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I stayed after they left, and then met a cadre of carpenters, including a very grateful American man named Jason (hi Jason!). The drinking continued as we cleared the place of all of its chicken bits, and all gotta a little cheerier and a little louder.</p>
<p>Finally, around midnight, I left to walk home. Somehow I’d spent quite a bit of money, and was a bit more tipsy than I figured. When I got back to my hotel, I had the presence of mind to take a bath, and wash all my clothes, then throw a few things on the charger for the next day.</p>
<p>I had an inkling I’d have a hangover&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="heading">二日酔い</h2>
<p>Ouch. I woke up with a wanging headache, and managed to get dressed and fill myself with the multi-course breakfast, including a very tall dairy-free pancake. I finished packing, then checked out of my hotel, quickly hopping on the phone with Chase to address my ticket issue and try to head back to the states earlier, in light of the US state department’s recommendation.</p>
<p><em>Cut to four hours later</em></p>
<p>Good news: I started playing animal crossing
Bad news: Chase never picked up (shakes fist at Chase Bank), and at the four hour mark, the call suddenly disconnected. What. The. Fuck.</p>
<p>I gave up.</p>
<p>I walked around for a while to find ramen and at least fill the hole in my stomach.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-tokyo">Back to Tokyo</h2>
<p>Freshly full of karaage and ramen from a cute local shop, I hopped on the X train, followed by a trip on the Nozomi high-speed Shinkansen to Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, I spent the whole train trip playing Animal Crossing and trying to appease that bastard Tom Nook.</p>
<h3 id="animal-crossing-interlude">Animal Crossing interlude</h3>
<p>Animal Crossing was a favorite of mine in college on the GameCube, and each iteration is a simple joy. The Switch update is the best version yet, and looks gorgeous. If you’re the type of person who enjoys games like Harvest Moon, or just has a lot of time over the next few months while we’re all social distancing, I highly recommend picking this game up. Email or text me for my friend code so we can trade fruit, or whatever. My island is called Lesbos. So far we only have peaches on Lesbos, which is kind of a cliche, but oh well.</p>
<h2 id="asakusa">Asakusa</h2>
<p>Found my hotel, and checked-in. There was art all over the place, including some from <a href="https://www.frankie-cihi.com">Frankie Cihi</a> from Terrace House. Dinner was a chill diner meal of yakitori and some cucumber stuff while watching a weird 罰ゲーム (punishment game) tv show. I rounded out the night with Devs episode 4 and some Animal Crossing.</p>
<h2 id="day-two-in-asakusa">Day two in Asakusa</h2>
<p>It was David’s birthday (hi David), so I woke up at 8:30am to play Animal Crossing with him and his pals. This continued through breakfast, where Haley (hi Haley) even visited my new island.</p>
<p>Later, I went to Fuglen for coffee and was recognized from tv by a Kanae and her boyfriend. I read for a while over a tasty cup of Columbian coffee, then headed back to my hotel for some shochu. After a shiokoji shochu-induced nap, I headed to get onigiri from the oldest onigiri shop in Tokyo, Yadoroku. Wow. It was so, so good. Afterwards I wandered around and ran into my first 外国人を入れない on this trip. Dang.</p>
<p>I ended up at a shop called 初代チョベリバ for a few drinks and chicken parts, then went home to read and watch tv.</p>
<p>Overall, a pretty chill day.</p>

      <description>Hello from a 200mph Nozomi Shinaksen train on my way to Tokyo! This train still feels like the future, and it’s especially wild that people are riding it and no one seems particularly worried.
Onomichi—where I was for the past few days—was gorgeous! Truly in rare form. If you’d like to read about that and see some photos of my hiking and exploring, you know where to go.
I spent four hours on the phone today with Chase bank trying to move my flight forward a few days to try to ensure that I won’t be trapped outside of California.</description>

<p>I spent <em>four hours</em> on the phone today with Chase bank trying to move my flight forward a few days to try to ensure that I won’t be trapped outside of California. Were it not for Snorri, I might consider trying to just work and hide out in Japan during this pandemic, but for both him and my work, it’s probably good to head home. Knock on some wood for me, or send good travel vibes—whatever your method of magic may be.</p>
<p>You’re probably not here to read about my Japanese vacation travails though, so without further ado, here’s the links:</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/davdchristmas/status/1239196410857340933">https://mobile.twitter.com/davdchristmas/status/1239196410857340933</a></p>

<li>You might know that I’m a racing fan, and especially love Formula 1 racing, but currently all the races this season are cancelled. Bummer. To get my high-octane thrill, I’ve resorted to watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3hEfwmzgDI">matchbox cars</a> thanks to my friend Stephan, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1cFm3dsaU">sim racing with actual F1 drivers</a>. YouTube is often a shitshow of terrible videos, but this week it’s a true savior with all of its odd niches. Maybe you’ll find a cool substitute for something you miss on there as well.</li>
<li>A few weeks ago, when we could still <em>gather</em>, I saw Kyle Chayka and Robin Sloan discuss Kyle’s new book. It was pretty fun, albeit sparsely attended. If you haven’t read <em>Longing for Less</em>, perhaps this will <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/03/the-pitfalls-and-the-potential-of-the-new-minimalism">convince you to pick up a a copy</a> from an independent bookstore. Robin even recommends a few other books in <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletter/march-2020/">his latest newsletter</a>.</li>
<li>I’m fascinated with the idea of <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/but-and/">“but/and”</a>. I’m not sure if it’ll catch on, but/and it’s cool.</li>
<li>Do you love museums? Do you love cats? <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cats-sneaking-security-ken-chan-gosaku-hiroshima-onomichi-city-museum-of-art/">Then you’re in luck</a>!</li>

<ul>
<li>Are you as amped about Animal Crossing: New Horizon as I am? Make sure you’re prepared if you plan to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185977/animal-crossing-new-horizons-local-multiplayer-island-sharing">share your island with your family</a>. There are benefits, but as a woman who lives alone, I certainly would prefer to keep my island of Lesbos to myself. Reply to this email if you want my friend code though :D</li>
</ul>
<p>The train is about to pull into the station in Tokyo, and then I’ll hop onto the metro line to Asakusa. Drop me a line and tell me something you’ve loved this week. I’ll share some good things again next week if you’d like me to pass them along. And as always, wash your hands and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

<h2 id="heading-south">Heading south</h2>
<p>Hopping on a call in the morning with Haley, Drl, and Zech was a nice way to start my last morning in Osaka. Background images were quickly swapped, and everyone was both upbeat, and a little stir-crazy. It felt nice to speak English a little, and hear about the bay and NYC.</p>
<p>After packing up my stuff, I headed to Lawson for onigiri, then walked towards my go-to coffee shop. Sadly, it was closed for the morning, so I sat and read until I could grab some ramen. I briefly got a little lost near Osaka station, but eventually made my way to the Shinkansen to head to Fukuyama, then Onomichi.</p>
<p>Transit is the scariest part of this trip.</p>
<p>Every year, the train journeys are one of my favorite part of coming to Japan, but this time, they feel a little more like steel-encased petri-dishes. The train to Fukuyama was busier than I thought it would be, and I sat next to a very quiet older woman for the 2 hour trip. I’d picked up some water and a lemon chuhai to keep me hydrated and chill during the trip, but since I was still reading Chuck Wendig’s <em>Wanderers</em>, I wasn’t exactly relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>Top Tip</strong> be careful not to read about plagues while you’re in the middle of one.</p>
<p>A brief stop in Fukuyama meant a small cup sake, then a local train to Onomichi.</p>
<h2 id="onomichi">Onomichi</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_view.jpg" alt="onomichi view"></p>
<p>Wow. This town is gorgeous. I fully plan to come back here and spend more serious time when I’m able to in the future. I love the river that runs through the middle of town, and the winding hilly roads and stairs. I learned on my first night that this town is <em>well known</em> for <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cats-sneaking-security-ken-chan-gosaku-hiroshima-onomichi-city-museum-of-art/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">cats</a>. I’m sure somewhere in the back of my head, I’d seen this and taken note, but mostly I came here to stay at <a href="https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/122/destination-japan/">LOG</a> and relax a little.</p>
<p>My first day was certainly relaxing after a hike up a hill to get to the hotel. I walked into the lobby sweating profusely and was offered oolong tea. After a brief tour I rested in my room and read. Later I took a long bath (I still can’t get over how wonderful Japanese bathtubs are—they actually <em>fit</em> my whole body), and then got a welcome drink at the bar.</p>
<p>Wow! They had <em>natural wine from Alsace</em>. Honestly LOG felt like a heaven—a retreat and a recharge from my worries. I hope more of you reading this are able to visit in the future, despite the nightly rate being a little steep (~$350 a night).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_dinner.jpg" alt="dinner"></p>
<p>Dinner was a multi-course vegetable-focused feast with more white and whiskey to go with it. The small restaurant could seat 20, but only myself and two other women (a couple?) were there. It was utterly bizarre to be the only guests in a hotel.</p>
<p>I chatted with the waiter and the other guests a little about food, drift-racing, and Slack.</p>
<p>Later I read by my window, and listened to jazz.</p>
<h2 id="day-two">Day two</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_pancake.jpg" alt="pancake"></p>
<p>I woke a little before my alarm and got ready for the day. My breakfast was served in the same small cafe as dinner, and included the best pancake I’ve had in years. The maple syrup was delightful and not to sweet, and there was coarse sea salt sprinkled over the top to balance the flavor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_library.jpg" alt="library"></p>
<p>While my room was cleaned, I hung out in the library of the hotel with the windows open, despite the construction on the street outside. The sawing and jackhammering was somehow oddly soothing. I liked the idea that despite everything, this crew was still repairing a mountain path hundreds of years older than my own country.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/ono_library_view.jpg" alt="view from library"></p>
<p>From what I’ve read, Onomichi was spared from bombing during the war, so many of the houses I see around are a very old style, with tiled roofs and small engawas. If it wasn’t for the electrical lines running overhead, my view from the library window would’ve seemed like time-travel.</p>
<p>It was gorgeous.</p>
<h2 id="cat-hunting">Cat hunting</h2>
<p>Later, I walked on the literature path all the way up to an observation point, and also visited the famous Tadao Ando-designed museum. I saw more than a few cats, but fellow was my favorite. We sat together for five minutes or so and appreciated the view.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/mr_cat.jpg" alt="mr cat"></p>
<p>All told I climbed 50 flights of steps during my hike. I only saw one other foreigner, but made sure to greet the older folks I walked past in the neighborhood with a cheerful 「こんにちは！」.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/elephant.jpg" alt="I later learned photographs were prohibited"></p>
<p>The museum had so much great cat art. I’m not a huge fine art lady, but even I enjoyed the 18th and 19th century Japanese paintings. It was pretty funny to see how white people were depicted in these paintings—all the bearded cello-playing weirdos from Holland and Portugal.</p>
<p>I also saw a mini-museum to the maneki neko while on the short cat alley walk, and later visited a few temples.</p>
<p>Overall, I loved the hike, and all the spectacular views of the city and the hills to the north and west of Onomichi.</p>
<h2 id="lunch-and-relaxing">Lunch and relaxing</h2>
<p>After a climb down the hill, I dropped by a 7/11 to pick up cash, then got ramen at a shop that I <em>think</em> used beef lard in the stock. I’m unclear. It was called 牛ちゃん, but the ramen had tonkatsu, and I also got karaage, so who knows. It was tasty though, with a Hakata-style straight noodle.</p>
<p>I made a fresh cup of Haiku-roasted Ethiopian coffee beans, and read for a while before exploring the city more for dinner.</p>
<p>I knew I would be sad to leave this place on Friday.</p>

      <description>Wow, things sure are quiet&amp;hellip;
Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about packing and my initial few days in Koenji in western Tokyo.
Off to Kyoto Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience.</description>

<h2 id="off-to-kyoto">Off to Kyoto</h2>
<p>Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience. If you’ve ever been to Japan, there’s a near-constant mass of people traveling via train stations, so I was both sad and glad to see folks taking none traveling seriously. I picked up an ekiben of box sushi and a chuhai, then headed to the old capital city for one night at BNA Alter Hotel, the Kyoto cousin of Koenji’s BNA.</p>
<p>In general, Kyoto was also much quieter, but had a slightly upbeat vibe and a bit more foot traffic than I saw in Tokyo. I think the smaller number of COVID cases meant Kyoto kept moving.</p>
<p>I found some amazing yakitori for dinner and drank a few glasses of fancy whiskey later on back at my hotel. I watched Contagion before drifting off to sleep, and it unfortunately felt prescient. I hope we have more Matt Damons and less Gwyneth Paltrows in our current pandemic.</p>
<p>Day two meant a solo breakfast at the hotel. There were only two of us there in the entire 31 room place. Wild.</p>
<p>I went on a walk later, to get some air, and come coffee at Dongree, where I also sat alone. On the way to the train station I got ramen at an empty shop run by two older people who were very happy to have me. One downside of this spot—they didn’t have hand soap in the restroom. Fortunately, I was carrying alcohol wipes, but I made a note to find alcohol spray at the next conbini I visited.</p>
<h2 id="osaka">Osaka</h2>
<p>The train ride to Osaka was a little nerve-wracking. The small train got much more crowded than any other train I’d been on, and the asshole youth who sat next to me picked his nose under his mask and coughed into his mask for a few stops. The older woman sitting near us kept giving him the stink eye. Seriously, fuck that guy.</p>
<p>I made it to my hotel a little early, and sat in the lobby before check-in. In a stark contrast to my huge room in Kyoto, the Nest hotel is a very tiny business hotel. I wasn’t really clear on the amenities when I booked it, but it’s basically a room large enough for a bed and a small chair. I spent most of the first night in my room, with a short excursion to get udon nearby. Later I watched Casino Royale, and had a canned highball. Truly high class, eh?</p>
<p>Every morning so far has meant catching up on the news around the world, practicing kanji, and trying to keep a little calm. I definitely felt more anxious in Osaka than in Koenji or Kyoto. Everyone outside seems much more blasé than other parts of Japan I’ve been to on this trip, despite the higher infection rate here.</p>
<p><em>knocks on wood</em> I hope this apparent nonchalance is fully warranted, and folks here will stay healthy.</p>
<p>I got Vietnamese food in an empty restaurant with my friends Laurie and Stephan, and then got coffee at Haiku, a local spot I love. Later I took a leisurely walk, followed by a little chuhai purchasing at the Lawson. Having a beer in my hotel room isn’t as great as a nice whiskey out, but I figured it’s better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Day two meant a long walk after buying some onigiri at the Lawson. Crowds were sparse, but a surprising number of people were still walking around and playing baseball in the park. I’d just read about the shutdown in San Francisco, and Osaka felt like the opposite. I got more coffee at Haiku, and made sure to buy extra pourover bags to-go so I would have backup coffee for my time in Onomichi.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon back at my hotel, watching sim-racing championships and napping. Later I got karaage and more chuhai at Johnny’s, then walked back under the subway line, and listened to a podcast. I felt lucky in a way that I could still experience wandering around Osaka during this pandemic, but also scared for what lies ahead for my friends and our homes.</p>
<p>Lawsons came through with another chuhai for my tv-filled evening. First up was the finale of Avenue 5, and then Quantum of Solace. Uncomplicated action movies are a nice escape, I think.</p>
<p>I set my alarm for a video call with my friend Haley, then headed to bed.</p>

<p>Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the following weeks COVID-19 grew at a wild rate, the cases in the United States were clearly skyrocketing despite a complete failure of the CDC and leadership to provide ample testing. My company cancelled business travel, but left it to us to determine our risk profile for personal travel, so I reached out to friends in the US and Japan to take stock. After a weekend of thinking and reading, I decided to travel to Japan unless flights were cancelled.</p>
<h2 id="the-trip-begins">The trip begins</h2>
<p>Many travelers had clearly cancelled their flights, as the plane was largely empty. Out of caution and care for passengers, the staff of the JAL plane were all wearing masks, and taking extra measures to clean and prepare our plane as well. As I boarded and settled-in, my first thought was “I wish folks too health this seriously all the time”.</p>
<p>Our flight was fairly bumpy, but I managed to sleep for a few hours, and even eat a bit before landing at HND. The usual self-service immigration booths were closed, but as one of the only visitors, I still made it through immigration and customs in minutes. As usual, the customs agent gave me an odd look for my small backpack and lack of luggage.</p>
<h2 id="the-bag">The bag</h2>
<p>This trip I brought a single bag: the <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/studio-backpack/venture/black">Bellroy Studio in Venture Weave Black</a>. After many trips with my RYU Quick Pack with a smaller day bag, I looked forward to a single light bag instead. So far on this trip, it’s been a comfortable bag, that easily hauls between locations. I haven’t used it very much outside of traveling to my hotels, as due to the virus I haven’t done a lot of writing from coffee shops or hiking. I used this bag daily for the past few months to go to work though, and am confident it would also be great to take a couple things with me to a coffee shop.</p>
<p>My packing list was pretty typical:</p>
<h3 id="clothes">Clothes</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 pairs of <a href="https://darntough.com/products/womens-ss18-vertex-no-show-tab-ultra-light">Darn Tough wool socks</a></li>
<li>1 <a href="https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-tops/cool-lite-solace-short-sleeve-scoop/104640.html">wool shirt from Icebreaker</a></li>
<li>1 pair of <a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/rectrek-pant">RekTrek pants from OV</a></li>
<li>1 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Peak-Womens-Rain-Trench/dp/B07MWC4KZ8">Snow Peak FR trench</a></li>
<li>2 pairs of <a href="https://negativeunderwear.com/collections/underwear/products/black-whipped-high-rise">Negative underwear</a></li>
<li>1 sports bra</li>
<li>1 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcteryx-Eagan-Tank-Top-Womens/dp/B078XHPXJH/ref=pd_sbs_468_4/136-2112403-2472869">tank from Arcteryx</a></li>
<li>1 pair of <a href="https://www.foxers.com/boxer-briefs/">shorts from Foxers</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3>
<ul>
<li>iPad 11” Cellular</li>
<li>Kindle Oasis</li>
<li>Switch Lite</li>
<li>Anker 10kmah battery</li>
<li>Cables</li>
<li><a href="https://satechi.net/products/usb-c-magnetic-charging-dock">Satechi watch charger</a> (got this for free from a Satechi rep. Thanks!)—short review: this is a little more compact and chill than bringing a watch cable, and can stick into the side of my iPad to let me charge while I’m writing. It’s a little more awkward plugged into a battery, but not too bad. It’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX2G2AM/A/apple-watch-magnetic-charging-cable-03m?fnode=83">only 10 bucks more than an Apple charger</a> so if you don’t have a travel charger this might be a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2020/all_about/weeks/">Hobonichi Weeks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kaweco-pen.com/en">Kaweco fountain pen</a></li>
<li>Toiletries in a <a href="https://matadorup.com/products/flatpak-toiletry-case">Matador bag</a> which so far, wow. I love this little bag.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m additionally wearing a duplicate of most of what I brought, save for the jacket and sleep clothes. I’m also testing out some <a href="https://us.soakwash.com/collections/laundry-soap">new laundry soap</a> while I’m here to see if it can keep my clothes fresh without needing a full in-shower scrub.</p>
<h2 id="koenji-social-distancing">Koenji social distancing</h2>
<p>My trip started in Koenji, where I stayed at my <a href="https://www.bna-hotel.com">favorite BNA</a>. By and large, I kept to my room, or did some socially-distanced hiking around Suginami. Lawson was a block away, and provided coffee and onigiri, but I also had coffees at Coffee AMP and INC near the train station. Honestly, other than mounting panic online, I found it to be relaxing to stick close to home. I went out for food a couple of times, but honestly felt a little afraid to go out. If I were in Oakland right now, it’s likely I wouldn’t have left the house this week at all, save for a walk around the block.</p>
<h2 id="to-be-continued">To be continued&hellip;</h2>

      <description>Welcome to a new world without toilet paper. Seriously, it’s fucking depressing seeing pictures of grocery stores post-hoarding. I hope everyone reading this cares for your fellow humans more than building a fort out of sanitizer and toilet paper.
Here’s a cat to help you feel better:

Sorry for starting on a bummer note, but it’s kinda wild out there, eh? I hope you’re taking care of yourself, washing your hands for 20 seconds, using lotion to protect your skin, and breathing deeply.</description>

<p>Sorry for starting on a bummer note, but it’s kinda wild out there, eh?
I hope you’re taking care of yourself, washing your hands for 20 seconds, using lotion to protect your skin, and breathing deeply. In this midst of the wild times, I bring you links and love from a train in Japan traveling 200 miles per hour. Everyone is wearing masks, and it’s gently raining outside of the window as we pass Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Ok, here’s the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>It turns out, on some sites it’s <a href="https://www.cjr.org/first_person/the-infinite-scroll.php">ads all the way down</a>. I personally use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bltoTMJZetc">an adblocker</a> for many, many reasons. It really helps with page load times too. If you’re feeling fancy, you can <a href="https://pi-hole.net">install one on your router</a>, or use something like an Eero that can handle blocking for you with no installation.</li>
<li>This piece was written <a href="https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2020/01/08/i-think-you-should-leave/">for our current world</a> about the Netflix show <em>I Think You Should Leave</em> and using Tim Robinson’s absurdist comedy to cope with dread. I loved this show, and have watched it more than once at this point. If you like it, I also recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMW-SzZKJ-Q"><em>Nathan for You</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2dSE6_utcE"><em>Review</em></a>, both of which are equally strange and oddly comforting. I know for some of you reading this, your empathy extends to fictional characters on tv, and makes watching “cringe” shows essentially impossible, but if you are like me, and enjoy some good old-fashioned schadenfreude&hellip; “Absurdist humor is a means to express the core disillusionment that lies at the heart of the millennial generation”.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/12/814414450/comic-i-spent-a-day-in-coronavirus-awareness-mode-epidemiologists-how-did-i-do">comic about trying really, really hard not to touch your face</a>. I always think “hot hands!” which helps a little. A habit I picked up from conferences, which are always hotbeds of illness, is to never touch my face or food until I’ve washed thoroughly. It even helps to wash during “transitions,” like, getting home, going to the restroom, etc. Soap: it’s really good.</li>
<li>This link might be a little odd considering we’re all working from home indefinitely, but here’s a bit about how folks are using mute and noise-cancelling to <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/hit-the-mute-button-why-everyone-is-trying-to-silence-the-outside-world">escape the world around them</a>.</li>
<li>Today, I’m off to Kyoto, which is trying to attract tourists currently through an <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/travel/Kyoto-starts-new-%27Empty%27-tourism-campaign-to-attract-tourists-during-coronavirus-outbreak">odd campaign</a>. I’m only there for one night, to enjoy a hotel room designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamantaka_Eye">EYヨ</a>. It promises to be an interesting experience. Hopefully I’ll have photos to share with you next week. Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUSGujidgns">one of my favorite albums by Boredoms</a>, the band that アイ started.</li>
<li>Finally, for you documentation nerds out there, I think this is a pretty interesting solution for folks who like <a href="https://hackmd.io/">using Github and Markdown to write</a>. It’s not particularly mobile-friendly, but theoretically one could edit and write in a markdown tool of choice, then use this app to do the collaboration bits. I still don’t really like Google Docs, and I fear for the future of Dropbox Paper, so I’m glad to see more work on open standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it from me today in 日本. I hope your Saturday is quiet and relaxing, and you’re able to have a great big belly laugh every day this week. Love yourself, and those around you, and as always—see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>This email comes to you from a rainy port city, where I am spending time on strategy and vision for the Women’s Foundation of Oregon. Spending the weekend with a room full of amazing women from all over the state comprising our board was incredible. My heart is full, and I’m hopeful for the work we can accomplish in the coming years.
Next week I’ll be in yet another city on the other side of the globe, and despite the prevalent fear of disease right now, I’m excited to be on the road again, testing my travel packing and gear.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>This email comes to you from a rainy port city, where I am spending time on strategy and vision for the Women’s Foundation of Oregon. Spending the weekend with a room full of amazing women from all over the state comprising our board was incredible. My heart is full, and I’m hopeful for the work we can accomplish in the coming years.</p>
<p>Next week I’ll be in yet another city on the other side of the globe, and despite the prevalent fear of disease right now, I’m excited to be on the road again, testing my travel packing and gear.</p>
<p>Whether you’re also traveling, or spending some time working from home this week, here are some links to keep you curious:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the topic of travel, did you know that scientists can’t agree on <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/">how planes stay in the air</a>? There are theories that mostly work, but all of them are missing some part. Honestly, it’s probably just an aeromancer on each plane.</li>
<li>Remember Fraidycat from last week? Robin wrote a bit more about how <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/master-tapes/">he’s enjoying it</a>, and how the creator of the site just wants to be left alone.</li>
<li>Here’s a heartening tale of a company that raised their <a href="https://kottke.org/20/02/what-happened-to-the-company-that-raised-minimum-wage-to-70kyr">minimum wage to 70k a year</a>. A lot of folks wanted them to fail, and thereby prove that the system works better when some people live in poverty, but it turned out folks do better work when they’re less stressed about money. I mean, c’mon.</li>
<li>Do you like books? Do you like arbitrary tournaments? Boom, here’s <a href="https://themorningnews.org/tob/2020/golden-state-v-oval-v-we-cast-a-shadow.php">both at once</a>. I love these silly march-madness-esque book-offs. I’ve only read a few books on this list, so I can’t wait to read more. Hopefully this tournament adds a few items to your to-read list too.</li>
<li>Speaking of good books, I’m loving <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8756/q-and-a-joanne-mcneil-lurking-book-how-person-became-user">Lurking</a>, which outlines the growth of the social web, and how people became <em>users</em>. I remember many of the events in this book very well, and Joanne interviewed folks that I know to write it, so it hit me at home. I usually don’t like non-fiction, Lurking moves through ideas in such an entertaining fashion that I forgot my preference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I saw cherry blossoms all over the city, and it got me excited for the new season! Japan traditionally has 24 seasons, and we just entered 啓蟄 which is when all the little critters crawl out to celebrate and move about. Personally, I’m very excited to be one of the animals exploring the world during this season, dutifully avoiding crowds. As I saw someone say online last week: “Avoiding crowds? I’ve been preparing for this my entire life.” Jokes aside, I hope you and yours stay safe and happy during what is a scary time. And as always, see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>XOXO it was the month of love&amp;hellip; for my new bike, and my always valentine Snorri. I watched a lot more movies this month than I read books, but that felt alright. Video games were also a theme, with lots of Witcher 3 and Dead Souls to keep me occupied. I also powered through a number of TV shows, like the Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan and the October Faction.

Video games were also a theme, with <em>lots</em> of Witcher 3 and Dead Souls to keep me occupied. I also powered through a number of TV shows, like the Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan and the October Faction.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>The Longing for Less</strong> — Kyle Chayka</p>
<p>This was far funnier than I expected, and also taught me a lot about a few areas of art and architecture I didn’t know about. A really informative and fun book.</p>
<p><strong>しろくまカフェ　1</strong></p>
<p>私のこれが最初日本語の漫画を読んだ。面白かったよ。次に谷崎の文学を読むww。</p>
<p><strong>Outline</strong> — Rachel Cusk</p>
<p>This was recommended to me, but I can’t say I loved it. The story here read more as a series of strange anecdotes, without a lot of core thread to grasp. There are two more books in this series, but I think I may pass on them.</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong> — William Gibson</p>
<p>A nearly present-day story of AI, art, and San Francisco. I really enjoyed this Peripheral sequel, though I think on the whole the fashion and strange web world of the previous trilogy was more my speed. I hope we get one more book with Netherton, Ash and company.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Jojo Rabbit</strong></p>
<p>A deeply strange film about learning how to be a person and unlearn fanaticism. There were some pretty excellent cameos in this, and a very dark comedic beat.</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Thread</strong></p>
<p>Wow, this movie was hilarious from top to bottom. A friend (hi Drew) invited me to see it for the first time in 70mm, and all I want to do is channel Woodcock every day. &ldquo;What am I supposed to do with that?&quot;. What a joy. I can't wait to watch this again.</p>
<p><strong>First Love</strong></p>
<p>A strange mistaken gangster film. This was much more straightforward than many Takeshi Miike films, but still managed to add in some really bizarre bits, and even some surprises.</p>
<p><strong>Elle</strong></p>
<p>Yow. That was&hellip; a lot of movie. Isabelle Huppert was fantastic, but I don't know if I could recommend it. Definitely one of the stranger Verhoeven movies I've seen.</p>
<p><strong>Anna</strong></p>
<p>Another lady assassin movie. It was a helluva ride and I enjoyed it. I don’t think it added anything huge to the genre, but I’m just glad to have more cool movies about tough women. That said, I wish Anna had been able to just be with her girlfriend instead of randomly fucking spymasters.</p>
<p><strong>Gennocidal Organ</strong></p>
<p>I read the book this movie is based on last year, and it’s a truly brutal story of linguistics and massive unrest. This movie is grim in a way that feels a little too prescient. Definitely one of the better anime thrillers I’ve seen in a while though.</p>
<p><strong>Psycho Pass Movie Trilogy</strong></p>
<p>After season 3, Psycho Pass had a trilogy of films in Japan. They’re fun continuations of the characters from all three seasons, and a bit of a sequel to the first movie. The future this film presents is pretty grim, but the animation is fantastic.</p>

      <description>This weekend is a bit sad, as it would have marked my countdown to a two week vacation in Japan, but due to coronavirus I had to cancel the trip. Perhaps I’ll do something else, but right now I’m just worried for my friends and coworkers abroad and at home. Keep your hands washed, your spirits up, and your days full of love.
I did plan a second trip this year in November for the amazing Focus retreat put on by Craig Mod.</description>

Perhaps I’ll do something else, but right now I’m just worried for my friends and coworkers abroad and at home. Keep your hands washed, your spirits up, and your days full of love.</p>
<p>I did plan a second trip this year in November for the amazing <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com/collections/retreats/products/focus-yoshino-retreat-2020-apply">Focus retreat put on by Craig Mod</a>. If you’re reading this, you might enjoy it, so I recommend <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com/collections/retreats/products/focus-yoshino-retreat-2020-apply">applying</a>.</p>
<p>Snorri is currently sitting on my shoulder, and I’m taking his plaintive cries as a, “get to the links!” so I will:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/036/">This is a wide-ranging newsletter installment</a> from one of my favorite newsletter writers recently. I particularly enjoyed this quote about developing our ideas and giving them real space:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If an idea is any good, chances are you shouldn’t just be tweeting it, but rather giving it a more solid, fleshed out form as a blog post or essay or zine or whatever. This is out of respect for the idea itself. What I find most dangerous about Twitter is that it can generate similar chemical feelings to having done “the work,” when in fact, you haven’t done the work. You’ve just micro-plastic’d idea potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There are so many ways to delete your tweets. I like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jumbo-privacy-security/id1454039975">Jumbo</a>, but perhaps you’re <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2/">into</a>  <a href="https://gist.github.com/robinsloan/3688616">scripts</a> or just want to artisanally <a href="https://micahflee.com/2019/06/semiphemeral-automatically-delete-your-old-tweets-except-for-the-ones-you-want-to-keep/">prune</a>. Take this opportunity, if you want, to <a href="https://tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me/">unfollow people</a> who no longer bring you joy. I’m still off of Twitter and I think it might just stick.</li>
<li>If you’ve been on the internet your whole life, or even just a lot of the adult parts, you perhaps carry shame from something you did or said. <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/emily-gould-gawker-shame.html">Emily Gould tackles hers from her time at Gawker</a>.</li>
<li>Chances are, you’ve worked in an open-plan office during your career. It <em>turns out</em> these are just about the <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/its-official-open-plan-offices-are-now-dumbest-management-fad-of-all-time.html">worst idea since Six Sigma</a> or trust falls. I don’t think cubicles are the solution either, but what if at some point we could have offices again?</li>
<li>Do you love cool women and skateboarding? Yea, me too! You might <a href="https://www.oh-so.co/shop">dig this magazine</a> in that case. Personally, I’ve got a serious backlog of <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com">Offscreen</a> and <a href="https://monocle.com">Monocle</a>, so I can’t quite subscribe right now, but it looks dope.]</li>
<li>I’m also reading <a href="https://www.kylechayka.com/book/">The Longing for Less</a> this weekend, which I got to hear a discussion about between Robin Sloan and the author, Kyle Chayka this week at the cute <a href="https://www.booksinc.net/SFOpera">Opera Plaza Books Inc</a>. If you’ve been around minimalism at all, or are curious about it, it’s well worth a read. It’s a critical survey and personal journey through music, writing, architecture, and hellish instagram minimalism.</li>
<li>Finally, I hope you get a chance to <em><a href="https://www.eattheball.com/">eat the ball</a></em>. Eat. The. Ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this deluge of links gives you something nice to read and explore as you take time for yourself this week. The times may be scary, but there are so many neat people and things around too, and I am personally trying to stay focused on that. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

I’ll write more about that experience soon, with some light suggested reading and a few tips. My main takeaway so far is that I spent a lot of time opening and closing and reopening Twitter for the last 10 years.

      <title>Using RSS to read-only Twitter</title>

      <description>The problem I&#39;ve been on Twitter for over a decade, and found that lately it&#39;s been more depressing and less enjoyable. I follow around five hundred people, of which I&#39;d estimate 2-300 actively tweet every month. Because many of the users I follow are friends of mine I want to keep up with their lives and jokes, but that leads me to compulsively check my Twitter client of choice throughout the day on iOS and Mac.</description>
      <content:encoded><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>I've been on Twitter for over a decade, and found that lately it's been more depressing and less enjoyable. I follow around five hundred people, of which I'd estimate 2-300 actively tweet every month. Because many of the users I follow are friends of mine I want to keep up with their lives and jokes, but that leads me to compulsively check my Twitter client of choice throughout the day on iOS and Mac. This habit distracts me from doing other things like being bored or curious. Really, I miss things I want to see and see ads instead.</p>
<h2 id="a-test">A test</h2>
<p>While I thought about my problem last weekend, I saw yet another friend swear off of the bird site for the month—I wondered if I could do the same. Would I miss it? Would I have trouble restraining myself from the twitch to launch the app and check in? Further, since a few writers post links to long-form writing on Twitter, might I actually miss some truly good stuff?</p>
<p>RSS is my main avenue for reading longer-form articles, and keeping up with the news and tech news—what if I could also use RSS for a few important-to-me Twitter accounts? Twitter <a href="https://mashable.com/2012/09/05/twitter-api-rss/">dropped official RSS support</a> before most people even knew Twitter existed, so a native solution was out of the question. Fortunately, a friend in the #xoxo Slack pointed out that many RSS services handle this natively—including, it turned out, Feedbin.</p>
<p>As it says on the site: <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/01/11/feedbin-is-the-best-way-to-read-twitter/">Feedbin is the best way to read Twitter</a>. It's even possible to only subscribe to media posts, or create and use a list of a few friends or publications.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-went">How it went</h2>
<p>After one day this test already feels pretty great. I saw a few updates in my RSS reader whenever I felt like checking-in, and I didn't need to scroll through ads and other random posts to find the gems. The design of my RSS solution was such that I wasn't encouraged to mindlessly like posts, or respond with commentary—I could text or talk to folks in Slack instead.</p>
<p>There was a real twitch by the end of the first couple days, where I kept thinking, &ldquo;launch Twitter and say <em>something</em> or read something,&rdquo; but fortunately I held out.</p>
<p>As a solution for &ldquo;where do I say random things?&rdquo; I created a drafts doc in iAWriter where I put my weird ideas. Perhaps I'll blog some or post some in my newsletter in the future as a single roll-up of random Brook thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="want-to-do-the-same">Want to do the same?</h2>
<p>If this seems interesting to you, you'll need three things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An <a href="https://feedbin.com">RSS backend</a></strong>. I prefer Feedbin because it's <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/09/11/private-by-default/">private by default</a> and is actively developed. It costs $5 a month, but is outstanding. Easily this is one of the most dependable, useful services I pay for every month.</li>
<li><strong>An <a href="https://reederapp.com">RSS app/reader</a></strong>. I prefer apps that work well across all the platforms I use: iPad OS, iOS, and MacOS. Reeder is made by a small shop, charges a small price for a very polished client with regular updates. Feedbin also has an app that is pretty great, and soon <a href="https://inessential.com/2019/08/26/netnewswire_5_0_now_available">NetNewsWire</a> will also have an iOS client. Try a few of these apps and see what suits your fancy.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter usernames</strong> you'd like to follow, or a list of those users. For this step, I highly recommend limiting yourself to users who tweet infrequently, or folks you absolutely love to read tweets from. Some folks are just joyful and funny, and I feel glad to see their updates whenever I check in. Other users are high-signal, but low frequency, so they're also ideal for this experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also two books I recommend if you're considering this and other ways that your life is made worse by a twitch to open things on your phone whenever life gets a little dull:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jkglei.com/unsubscribe/">Unsubscribe by Jocelyn Glei</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.catherine-price.com/how-to-break-up-with-your-phone">How to Break Up With Your Phone by Catherine Price</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There's a strong temptation to replace Twitter or other social networks with &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, but in my opinion, this is a trap, and what we actually can do is leave space for creativity, boredom, and the world around us. Every minute of every day doesn't need to be &ldquo;productive&rdquo;, and one doesn't need to flit from activity to activity like a hummingbird with an MBA.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd recommend Slacking, emailing, or texting anyone you'd like to &ldquo;reply&rdquo; to when you read something enjoyable. For a lot of folks, myself included, there's a real community to Twitter on the best of days, and I don't want to lose touch with people I like on there, so reaching out, actually reaching out, might just work.</p>

      <description>First of all, look at this DUCK!
https://twitter.com/hartyt_/status/1228149203261698048?s=21
I’m writing this intro at my dining table, while someone cleans my house. Hiring a house-cleaner is one of the most awkward and also incredible things I’ve done in the past few years. I learned it’s a lot cheaper than I thought it would be—in Portland it cost 60 bucks a session. I haven’t figured out how to not feel like I’m in the way the whole time, or how to comfort Snorri, but at least my house is pretty damn clean for a few days.</description>

I haven’t figured out how to not feel like I’m in the way the whole time, or how to comfort Snorri, but at least my house is pretty damn clean for a few days.</p>
<p>It’s cloudy outside today, but I still plan to venture to a pop-up Yakitori thing put on by some pals at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/torimancal/">鳥万
</a>. Feeling hungry? Feast on these links:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you ever want to explore the fantastic electronics market of Shenzhen, <a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/essential/essential-guide-shenzhen-web.pdf">this guide is a must read</a>. I've never been, but I've heard it handily beats out Akihabara for wacky and delightful electronic goods.</li>
<li>While we're on the topic of China, this Chinese fashion designer blew me away with <a href="https://coolhunting.com/style/penultimates-dazzling-diy-influenced-collection/">this collection</a>. I love the utterly bizarre combination of patterns and body-horror.</li>
<li>You probably saw this online this week, but this guy's daughter rocked the world with the creation of <a href="https://twitter.com/craigcalcaterra/status/1227594895747141632?s=12">long Chile and Ohio 2</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, you don’t know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg4Dyx3XXDg">about squeakin’?</a>?!</li>
<li>If you’ve ever talked to a person in tech, you may have heard, “you should learn to code. This refrain sometimes come from a good place, but also feels like “hey dumdum, just make a software!” I really like the way that Robin Sloan reframed it this week as: “learn to be a home cook”. We usually don’t learn how to cook so we can open a Michelin-started restaurant, but instead so we can feed ourselves. <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">What does this look like when the oven is computers?</a></li>
<li>If you’re a podcast fan, perhaps some of the shows you love are celebrating ten years of recording. One of my favorites is the extremely nerdy <a href="https://overcast.fm/+kMZLu2m8">The Incomparables</a>. Every episode is a discussion of comics, movies, books, or something equally nerdy. There are lots of drafts, and I have genuinely enjoyed laughing along with them since 2010. MBMBAM will also hit 500 soon. Feeling a little old, lol.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoyed today's whirlwind tour of <em>links</em>. The cleaning is still going on here near the IKEA, and I'm getting peckish. Tomorrow is a holiday here, luckily, and I plan to do very little. I hope you have a long weekend too, and tomorrow will be a day of rest and relaxation. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>Shochu, CSS, and “enough”
This week marked the inaugural Figma conference, which I was able to attend through my employer. It was neat to be surrounded by designers from all over the world, and think about how to solve bigger problems than just “how to make people click”.
I also got to meet up with Craig Mod of hiking, ebook, and Leica writing renound—he’s a delight. At a certain point in life I realized most of the people I dig know each other, so it wasn’t a surprise he knew the Andys and Patrick.</description>

<p>This week marked the inaugural <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL_ruBAwVmo">Figma conference</a>, which I was able to attend through my employer. It was neat to be surrounded by designers from all over the world, and think about how to solve bigger problems than just “how to make people click”.</p>
<p>I also got to meet up with <a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/035/">Craig Mod</a> of hiking, ebook, and Leica writing renound—he’s a delight. At a certain point in life I realized most of the people I dig know each other, so it wasn’t a surprise he knew the <a href="https://waxy.org/">Andys</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hoverbird">Patrick</a>. We got to talk about the realities of living in Japan as a white American, as well as creating our own families outside of the heteronormative frame.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a nice week. How was yours? Reply if you feel like sharing.</p>
<p>And now, the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/">the time before CSS</a>? The simple text-mostly world of blue underlined and tables? This is the internet I cut my teeth on, and learned how to code into.</li>
<li>In the world of tech and productivity, everyone is pushing harder and harder to get more done. What if instead of efficiency, we looked <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/energy-efficiency/forget-efficiency-it-time-get-serious-about-sufficiency.html">towards <em>sufficiency</em></a>?</li>
<li>On the same note, this article is a meditation on <a href="https://pjrvs.com/enough">having enough</a>.</li>
<li>If you’ve been outside in the states at all, you’ve likely noticed the preponderance of huge, lumbering SUVs in the past two decades. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7q7eb/electric-or-not-big-suvs-are-inherently-selfish">Vice dug into why they exist</a>, and I have a feeling you won’t be surprised much by who drives them.</li>
<li>Need something to watch? This week I saw <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80187302">The Stranger</a> on Netflix, with Richard Armitage from a very good season of Spooks, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/07/apple-tv-plus-mythic-quest-now-available/">Mystic Quest: Raven’s Banquet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not you’re celebrating the annual chocolate and mistake-a-thon that Valentine’s Day is, I hope you treat yourself to something nice to drink or eat. See you next week space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>A fiscal happy new year to you! I still don&#39;t really understand how fiscal years work, but in addition to a lunar new year, Snorri and I celebrated the beginning of FY21, and the 6th anniversary of my employer this weekend. Thrills and chills.
Doesn&#39;t it already feel like spring? Just a little bit? At least in the bay, the plant outside are flowering, and it&#39;s already a little warm-is. This is my second year of not really having a winter, and I find the whole thing deeply confusing.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>A fiscal happy new year to you! I still don't really understand how fiscal years work, but in addition to a lunar new year, Snorri and I celebrated the beginning of FY21, and the 6th anniversary of my employer this weekend. Thrills and chills.</p>
<p>Doesn't it already feel like spring? Just a little bit? At least in the bay, the plant outside are flowering, and it's already a little warm-is. This is my second year of not really having a winter, and I find the whole thing deeply confusing. On the upside, I never needed to add anything beyond a <a href="https://www.tannergoods.com/products/merino-watch-cap">beanie</a> and a <a href="https://www.parachutehome.com/products/waffle-robe">bathrobe</a> to my wardrobe.</p>
<p>On to the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>The well-regarded Mac and iOS calendar app Fantastical released a somewhat <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/the-new-fantastical-review/">controversial new version</a> this week that adds a ton of great stuff, but also moves to a subscription. I think I'll pay for this, especially because it means I can now create Zoom video links without needing to use Chrome. I'd reverted to using the basic calendar app on all my devices until now, but Fantastical 3 adds just enough polish and feature magic to get my cash.</li>
<li>Do you ever think about the future of the internet? <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/before-zuckerberg-gutenberg/603034/">This article from the Atlantic</a> takes lessons from the printing press to assert we're likely wrong. I still think in general there will be a mix of democratizing and open publishing and the horrible continuation of the advertising gristmill.</li>
<li>Frankly, if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113421/soft-robot-hands-sweat-overheating-research">sweaty robots</a> are the future, count me out.</li>
<li>Need a little pick-me-up? Perhaps you'd enjoy some <a href="https://tinyspells.xyz">tiny spells</a>.</li>
<li>My friend Casey gave a seminar on writing recently, and luckily for us, she shared <a href="https://caseyplett.wordpress.com/2020/01/31/notes-from-my-seminar-at-usask/">her notes</a>. If you care at all about writing, it's worth a read.</li>

<p>As always, may your week be filled with the appropriate amount of hydration, rest, and merriment. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>2020 began in earnest, and despite it being winter, in the Bay Area it’s delightfully sunny. I spent the first week largely sitting by the window of my apartment, reading and studying Japanese. So far, I really enjoy the slower pace of this decade.
Books Mainline — Deborah Christiansen
A fun throwback to the world of cyber decks and assassins. I wish I’d found this in 1996, but it holds up well.</description>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Mainline</strong> — Deborah Christiansen</p>
<p>A fun throwback to the world of cyber decks and assassins. I wish I’d found this in 1996, but it holds up well. The plot got a little convoluted, but supposedly there’s a very recent sequel, so perhaps there will be payoff.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Valley</strong> — Anna Weiner</p>
<p>Ah, the tech industry. I’ve been working in this world for over a decade and this book felt like a survey of it. I know a few people mentioned in the chapters, and am unfortunately very familiar with many of the events. I think Weiner did a great job of capturing the constant, weird feeling of trying to survive and often getting lost in the self-satisfied world of tech founders and “disruption”.</p>
<p><strong>Throne of Glass</strong> — Sarah J. Maas</p>
<p>I was drawn to this book by the front cover and the vague notion that it might be like Gideon the Ninth. It’s not exactly super different, but it’s clearly YA, where Gideon is not. I may continue the series, as it was decently compelling, but I wish it were more genre and less youth.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribe</strong> — Jocelyn Glei</p>
<p>Although this book is deep in the details of email, most of it applies just as well to Slack and other forms of messaging. I appreciate her approach to mindful work, as well as how she thinks about the problems of people and communication. A worthwhile read, especially if you struggle with a mountain of other people’s problems</p>
<p><strong>The Walking Man</strong> — Jiro Taniguchi</p>
<p>The art in this manga is gorgeous. I especially love the way the leaves and grass are drawn. The stories are largely dialogue-less vignettes that meander through cities and the countryside, taking it all in. When I open this book, I wish I were in Japan again, following stray cats around town.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Eternal</strong> — M.G. Wheaton</p>
<p>This is an interesting take on apocalyptic fiction. With an AI protagonist and a dying sun, the story careens across the Americas and then even further. There’s a strange love story I didn’t care much for, but otherwise this was a nice romp.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Weathering with You</strong></p>
<p>I found out I don’t need to worry about climate change because it’s just rain, ya know? This film was gorgeous and fun and o loved the cat in it with my entire heart.</p>
<p><strong>Matrix: Reloaded</strong></p>
<p>Really starting the year off right. We talked through most of the exposition, which was like 75% of the movie. I hadn’t seen this since it came out, and it really didn’t hold up.</p>
<p><strong>The Lighthouse</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I noticed in this film was the tight, constrained feel of a square frame with deep black and white images. I immediately had to look around for <a href="https://www.musicbed.com/blog/filmmaking/cinematography/breaking-down-the-cinematography-of-the-lighthouse/">how this was made</a>. The VVitch is one of my favorite movies of all time, and Eggers doesn't disappoint in this haunting film either. The dread builds as the antipathy between the two men grows. A joy.</p>

      <description>redesigns and long reads. I got to see William Gibson this week in the city, and listening to his southern drawl discuss the intricacies of stubs and alternate realities. Once I finish Mainline, I can’t wait to dive into Agency. Maybe every generation has a real feeling of living in the future, but between tech news and world news, things are a little too reminiscent of sad cyberpunk. This is why I read fiction—at least there we can have heroes.</description>

<p>I got to see William Gibson this week in the city, and listening to his southern drawl discuss the intricacies of stubs and alternate realities. Once I finish <a href="https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/deborah-christian/mainline.htm">Mainline</a>, I can’t wait to dive into <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/william-gibson-takes-aim-at-the-silicon-valley-he-helped-create-in-an-exclusive-excerpt-of-agency-97c3604fbcde">Agency</a>. Maybe every generation has a real feeling of living in the future, but between tech news and world news, things are a little too reminiscent of sad cyberpunk. This is why I read fiction—at least there we can have heroes.</p>
<p>And now, the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>No family? If you’re in Japan, you can <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry">rent one</a>. I wonder if this would save me money on therapy, or leave me even more psychically confused?</li>
<li>Two sites I read have recently gone through a redesign (much like mine), and it’s fun to see how they <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/gardening-vs-architecture/">thought about it</a>. Even when the site update isn’t a bit overblown it can be <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/the-great-anifem-makeover-is-here/">very interesting</a>.</li>
<li>In addition to redesigning our personal websites (you started blogging, right? It’s good for you), perhaps we should find other ways to <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/opinion/world-wide-web.html">fix the web</a></em>.</li>
<li>One friend who blogs blessed us this week with a survey of the <a href="https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/579803.html">feral cats of their neighborhood</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, here’s <a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/essays/my-instagram/">a longer read about Instagram</a>. More than a few friends consider Instagram to be their nice, chill place online—a place for soothing images and creativity. I wish it had stayed that way for me, but alas, between ads, and folks aiming to take the exact same photo or get <em>really stoked</em> on exercise, I found it uncomfortable at best. For me, Slack is largely the place I see friend’s photos. I hope that at some point a non FB company will try to solve the friends + friends of friends photo sharing problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year I decided to upgrade my coffee at home a bit more than before, and my latest acquisition is all about <a href="https://www.hario.jp/seihin/productdetail.php?product=XGS-60TB">drinking coffee by the window</a> and reading books. Prior to this coffee server, I would drip directly into a Zojirushi vacuum thermos, but I prefer the look at ease of carrying that this brings. It’s never a bad idea to add a little class to one’s weekend, I think. On that note, I would encourage you to take a few deep breaths, and think about simple ways you can make your days off even more relaxing and delightful.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Sunday, and I’ll see you next week space cowgirls~</p>

      <description>January is nearly over! I had a delicious meal last night of pork cartilage soup (豚軟骨汁) and dug into an old classic sci-fi book on recommendation from Robin Sloan’s newsletter. It’s weird and fun so far. I also started back at the gym last week, which left me hobbling around as my body complains about all the rowing I did. At least it’s next to my office!

<li>Throw on the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-knows/1479120003?i=1479120009">new Alice Boman</a> while you read, or even after, on a long walk.</li>
<li>Anne Helen of burnout fame wrote elegantly this week about how we manage to <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-wages-of-productivity">always be working, and never actually resting</a>.</li>

<li>Maybe we should start thinking <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/01/06/circular-time-vs-linear-time/">more about seasons and less about years</a>. I’m really enjoying this winter, partially because I’m trying to embrace the good things about it.</li>

      <description>We’re halfway through with the first month of 2020, and the sun has been out a lot this week in the bay. Luckily, I got some new sunglasses so I’m feeling great about the whole thing.
Have you already mastered all of your New Year’s resolutions? Mine was the same as it is every year: “do more of what you love and less of what you hate”. So far, so good.</description>

<p>Have you already mastered all of your New Year’s resolutions? Mine was the same as it is every year: “do more of what you love and less of what you hate”. So far, so good.</p>
<p>One of the things I love is writing, so I’ll keep on doing it. Another is the television program <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-09-rewatching-halt-catch-fire/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which I wrote about so that I could combine pleasures. If only I’d managed to eat prosciutto while writing, I would’ve likely passed out from delight.</p>
<p>Two new things I’m trying this year: going to the gym next to my office, and washing my face. I was a big powerlifter for over a year in Portland, but never found my rhythm here in the bay due to a weird commute. Fortunately, the gym next to my office seems great for lifting, and since it’s literally a few feet from the bus home, I think I’ll be able to use it at least a few times a week. Time will tell. As for washing my face? I’ve never really done it, so I’m not sure what I’ll get out of the whole endeavor, but I’m <em>aging</em> so I figured no time like the present.</p>
<p>Ok, sorry for the rambling, I know you’re here for&hellip; the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s chilly out in the northern hemisphere, so perhaps you’d enjoy a sauna or hot tub dip. If you’re not quite sold on them yet, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/05/16/sauna-enthusiasm-manga-sadou-steams-up-a-live-action-tv-drama">Sadou</a>, the delightful program about a sauna a lover is really delightful. I’m not sure if there are subtitles out there yet, but if you can speak Japanese, or just enjoy a show where you don’t know what’s being said, I highly recommend taking a look.</li>
<li>While we’re on the topic of Japan, how about a man who bakes <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7571/meet-lord-rod-the-sweet-potato-king-of-yokohama-japan?zd=1&amp;zi=uyn27jjq">sweet potatoes on the back of his custom Miata</a>? My friend Joe writes some truly engaging essays, and this one is especially fun.</li>
<li>If you prefer animated shows, <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/winter-2020-premiere-reviews/">this season of anime</a> is promising, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Eizouken">Eizouken</a>. There are some stinkers too, but hopefully you can avoid those.</li>
<li>Currently I’m reading a few things, and you might like them. First, a <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/">magazine about life</a> and often about turning things off and going out into the world. Next, a book that teaches you how to <a href="https://jkglei.com/unsubscribe/">get better at time and communication</a>. Finally, I am exploring the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_of_Glass">assassins with Celaena</a> and an assortment of dull men.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully these links keep you warm this week, and you’re able to find time for yourself and the things you love. Until next week!</p>

      <description>The first time When Halt &amp;amp; Catch Fire first aired, I was lucky enough to clue in and watch it weekly on AMC. As a Texan with a dad who occasionally worked in or at least around tech, and then joined the industry myself, it captured the world I grew up in incredibly well. Starting out a little rough, it became a show all about family and how ambition can destroy everything.</description>
      <content:encoded><h2 id="the-first-time">The first time</h2>
<p>When Halt &amp; Catch Fire first aired, I was lucky enough to clue in and watch it weekly on AMC. As a Texan with a dad who occasionally worked in or at least around tech, and then joined the industry myself, it captured the world I grew up in incredibly well. Starting out a little rough, it became a show all about family and how ambition can destroy everything. H&amp;CF remains one of my favorite shows of all time, and despite it being entirely too emotionally intense to watch again before now, I happily tuned back in this past fall.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/Halt.jpg" alt="halt and catch fire logo"></p>
<h2 id="a-rewatch-begins">A rewatch begins</h2>
<p>I'd almost forgotten how hopeful the show began. Joe, Cameron, Donna, Boz, and Gordon all dove in and ended up going to an early CES—when AVN still happened next door. As I write this, CES is happening again in Vegas, but the dreams are smaller and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/concept_electronics_show">the concepts more far-fetched</a>. In the 80s of this show, the world was about to change completely. We follow a company at the time of IBM's dominance, with a parallel but less successful track than Apple. Word processors barely existed, and computers weighed 30lbs.</p>
<p>What so quickly began as a dream to make the future of computing turned into just making another IBM clone. What stuck with me in this first season was the crushing sadness of mediocre money. When I watched season one, I was a younger woman with a lot of dreams. Five years later, I've had a fair amount of failure, and some great success. I work for <a href="https://slackhq.com">an amazing company</a> after <a href="https://www.turbinelabs.io">our Mutiny</a> petered-out. Unlike the Cardiff Electronics or McMillain Utility of H&amp;CF, my next adventure is delightful.</p>
<p>I still haven't seen another show that so fully captures how difficult it is to build something with the folks you love or how much it hurts to lose them. With a second watch, I brought my feelings and memories of all of the ups and downs, which compounded each wave. Everyone was so young. It felt like this show was about adults when I first saw it, but now they seem like me or even younger. This realization helped me have more compassion for the idiocy and backstabbing as I watched. Before I saw a thoughtless jerk, and now I saw the pain of making tough decisions. When I first watched this show, I had just moved to Portland, Oregon, and now that I'm watching it for a second time, I'm in the bay—the setting for most of the show. I see many of the backdrops that Joe and Donna see on a daily basis, and it really makes the show come alive.</p>
<h2 id="a-queer-angle">A queer angle</h2>
<p>From the first time I saw him on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Daisies">Pushing Daisies</a>, I had a feeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Pace">Lee Pace</a> was on my team. Last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/style/gay-actors-on-broadway-lee-pace.html">in the NY Times</a>, he confirmed it. H&amp;CF showed a brief glimpse of the AIDs crisis, and one fleeting queer party at Joe's house. I wish they'd let written the show with more queer characters, or done more too how the struggle of gay men in the 80s and 90s, but even these little bits were more than I ever expected from a show about tech. I hope one day a story like this can have queer and trans women too.</p>
<h2 id="donna-and-cameron">Donna and Cameron</h2>
<p>By the second season, it seems like the show runners had the same revelation many of my friends watching the show for the first time have: this show is better when it's about Donna and Cameron. The tensions between them, and the challenges of their friendship are the lifeblood of the show. Cameron needs Donna's stability, and Donna wants the respect that everyone has for Cameron's abilities. As Mutiny struggles, and Swap Meet kicks off the tensions almost destroy them, but by the end of the show, they're ready to trust again. Their love and sisterhood are often sad, but ultimately an inspiring look at how two women can go beyond a competition to something lasting.</p>
<p>I haven't seen Kerry Bishé in much since H&amp;CF, but it seems like she's been busy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happily_(film)">big film projects</a>. Meanwhile, Mackenzie Davis was in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Junipero">incredible episode of Black Mirror</a>, the upcoming adaptation of Station Eleven, and the ridiculous new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_Dark_Fate">Terminator film</a>. I don't know if they'll ever work together again, but they were incredible together in this show.</p>
<h2 id="the-tech">The tech</h2>
<p>Most of the first few seasons were populated with technology I never got to use as a kid, save for the Apple IIe, but by the third season I saw myself in Donna and Gordon's daughter's eagerly waiting for a chance to play the NES. My parents used to bogart Super Mario Brothers just like Cameron and Gordon did as they played it on their new projection screen. My dad was never a HAM radio guy, but the single-minded love of hobbies mirrored Gordon's. I remember Lotus software, and the rise of laser tag, the thrill of dialing-up to the burgeoning world-wide web. I wish anyone on this show had learned how to touch-type.</p>
<p>I don't fondly remember the rise of security software, but hey, neither did the show. Watching this show, I saw myself as a kid around with a big set of headphones over my head, and a walkman on my belt. Those were the days. The community of Mutiny was what I found eventually on forums and in queer chat rooms and that too fly true in this show. I even love some of the cars—RIP Joe's 944.</p>
<h2 id="halt-and-catch-fire-is-incredible">Halt and Catch Fire is incredible</h2>
<p>This rewatch was inspired by <a href="https://500ish.com/halted-caught-fire-8128de2d111a">a newsletter I read</a>, wherein the writer is afraid to finish the show completely. I understand this feeling completely, as I find myself slowing down while I watch in order to savor every episode. I'll probably rewatch this show a few more times this decade, and I can only hope someone else one day makes a show I'll love as much as this one.</p>

      <description>Links: Week One It’s 2020! Welcome to the new decade. Imagine for a moment the news hasn’t already been wild, and step into a this list of joy and edutainment instead. A lot of links this week are to older projects for folks I’ve mentioned before, because I just got back from a long holiday of reading and watching things on tv, so I rediscovered some old favorites. I also redesigned my website, and moved it from Jekyll to Hugo, which meant some painful time with Go templating.</description>

<p>It’s 2020! Welcome to the new decade. Imagine for a moment the news hasn’t already been wild, and step into a this list of joy and edutainment instead. A lot of links this week are to older projects for folks I’ve mentioned before, because I just got back from a long holiday of reading and watching things on tv, so I rediscovered some old favorites. I also redesigned <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">my website</a>, and moved it from Jekyll to Hugo, which meant some painful time with Go templating. Yikes.</p>
<p>Without further ado, release the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>My friend Andy ran another conference before the delightful XOXO, and the talks are still archived for your edification. <a href="https://vimeo.com/63008757">This one from Robin Sloan</a> is a delight. From a different year of build, <a href="https://vimeo.com/33919422">Craig Mod talks about books</a> and their future. 2019 was a banner year for both of their newsletters, and if you haven’t seen them, here’s <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/">Craig’s</a> and here’s <a href="https://desert.glass">Robin’s</a>.</li>
<li>If you enjoyed watching Craig Mod’s talk, and you want to read more, his <a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/">work on ebooks holds up well</a>. As a person who reads every day on a Kindle, I have hope that perhaps the love of text and reading experience will one day fully enter the digital realm. Until then, I’ll keep vacillating between books and ebooks.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>During the break I picked up a rad re-release of a classic manga called <a href="https://www.greenapplebooks.com/book/9781912097364">“The Walking Man”</a>, and it’s both gorgeous and delightfully banal. The book is mostly about a man walking quietly through urban Japan. That’s it. Sometimes he climbs trees.</li>
<li>During the holiday I also got to spend a lot of time with my friend Julian, who writes <a href="https://maudlinhouse.net/i-am-a-beautiful-bug/">excellent short fiction</a> and a column about <a href="https://entropymag.org/the-care-and-feeding-of-your-sex-change-dan-ortberg-discusses-the-important-matter-of-soup/">gender and food</a>. We ate quite a bit of food, and rang in the new year at a party where everyone wore wigs. A+ would hang out again.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right, thanks for reading along, and being part of my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-30-what-i-learned-from-sending-a-newsletter-this-year/">newsletter journey over this last year</a>. If you’re still hungry for more newsletter <em>content</em>, I recommend learning about life and birds with <a href="https://tinyletter.com/night_heron">Morgane, the night heron</a>.</p>

      <description>Out of 74 movies, I wanted to pick a few that really stood out, and then talk briefly about a few that I really didn&#39;t enjoy. I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn&#39;t get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I&#39;ve accrued over the years.</description>

Other films that I didn't get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I've accrued over the years.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/letterboxd.jpeg" alt="favorite movies photo"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-list">The List</h2>
<p>In no particular order, here are ten films that really stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>‌Uncut Gems</strong></p>
<p>A real delight of failure and crushed dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Shoplifters</strong></p>
<p>A family of criminals gets to be perfectly human.</p>
<p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p>
<p>Nicole Kidman is a badass drunk detective.</p>
<p><strong>Us</strong></p>
<p>Under the boarrrrddddwalk. Boardwalk.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic</strong></p>
<p>Competence porn.</p>
<p><strong>Midsommar</strong></p>
<p>The best breakup film ever.</p>
<p><strong>The Farewell</strong></p>
<p>I cried quite a bit—major family feelings.</p>
<p><strong>First Reformed</strong></p>
<p>The world is getting hotter, and Ethan Hawke is too, inexplicably.</p>
<p><strong>Booksmart</strong></p>
<p>Cool buddy comedy with a talented younger cast.</p>
<p><strong>Parasite</strong></p>
<p>Eat the rich.</p>
<p>Honorable mention: Ford Vs. Ferrari.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p><strong>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker</strong></p>
<p>Look, I don't want to spoil this for anyone who cares, but has somehow not seen the film yet. I was super disappointed in how the series ended, and what a raw deal Rose got. Did we need <em>yet another droid</em>? It's particularly sad that with the Mandolorian really succeeding as a tv show, this is the pap we get in theaters. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/demiadejuyigbe/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/1/">Demi is better at tearing this apart than I am</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Predator</strong></p>
<p>Wow. Even as a fan of crap action films, this was a letdown.</p>
<p><strong>Hobbes &amp; Shaw</strong></p>
<p>Listen, I <em>love</em> the Fast &amp; Furious series like a warm blanket—it has cars, explosions, family, and little-to-no-complexity. Some of that was still present in this film, but they managed to hamstring the only female protagonist, and replace all the joy with ball jokes.</p>
<p><strong>Wandering Earth</strong></p>
<p>I don't know why I expected this to be great, but it was just hokey as hell.</p>
<p><strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong></p>
<p>I know, right? I hated the new Star Wars and the end of the Avenger's duology? I'm obviously a monster. Unfortunately, this movie was much like Rise of Skywalker in that it mistook random scenes of characters folks recognize for a plot or joy. It takes more than seeing Spider-Man appear on screen for me to be excited these days—just look at the incredible Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse for tips on how to do this well. I think some plot lines do better in multiple comics, and not on the silver screen. Smaller, more fun superhero films in 2020, please.</p>
<h2 id="2019-streaming">2019 streaming</h2>
<p>Wow, 2019 was a great year for films! If you want to read longer reviews of the above films, visit my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/movies">movies page</a>. I didn't set out to watch more films this year, but with Amazon Prime, Criterion, Kanopy, iTunes, and Netflix, it was super easy to watch most of the stuff I wanted to see. I finally upgraded to a 4K TV and 4K Apple TV too, so I will likely watch even more things at my house without trekking to the land of empty cola machines and questionable curly fries.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2020">2020</h2>
<p>Looking towards next year, the films I'm currently most excited about are:</p>
<p><strong>A Promising Young Woman</strong></p>
<p>Revenge films? Yes please.</p>
<p><strong>New Mutants</strong></p>
<p>One of the coolest X-Men teams ever, in the theater.</p>
<p><strong>No Time to Die</strong></p>
<p>I honestly love James Bond films, and I can't pretend otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Monster Hunter</strong></p>
<p>I don't know why I love Resident Evil movies so much, but the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson has moved to a new video game adaptation has me stoked.</p>
<p><strong>Dune</strong></p>
<p>The David Lynch version of Dune, in all of its weirdness, was one of the movies I watched on repeat as a child. I know, that explains a lot, right? I can't wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the subject matter. The spice must flow!</p>

      <description>Books Dept. of Speculation — Jenny Offill
A gorgeous and sad book that captures long relationships so well. I loved for narrator and the strange poetic style of storytelling. I read this in two sittings and was enraptured.
Dead Astronauts — Jeff Vandermeer
This book did some interesting things with time, and some deeply annoying things with text. I feel like I know what he was doing with this book largely, and support his environmental aims (a+ murderous blue fox), but it never really came together for me.</description>

<p><strong>Interference</strong> — Sue Burke</p>
<p>A fun follow-up to a great book from last year. I loved seeing how modern Earth folks mixed with the people on the rainbow bamboo planet. I was surprised to find that we only followed a single generation of characters this time, but I did enjoy how they were more fleshed-out.</p>
<p><strong>This is How You Lose the Time War</strong> — Amal el-Mohtar and Max Gladstone</p>
<p>A deeply strange time-travel romance between two competing spies, Blue and Red. The central conceit of shifting threads of history and letter-leaving was fun, but at times I honestly had no idea what was going on. I really enjoyed this book.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Ford vs. Ferrari</strong></p>
<p>A blast! I love car racing so much, and this film was a gorgeous vision of a famous showdown between an incredible car company, and Ford. I grew up hearing stories about Shelby, and this film brought him to life.</p>
<p><strong>Uncut Gems</strong></p>
<p>This was wild! From front to back this movie was a rollercoaster of poor decision-making and the world of vigs, 3 way parlay, and Kevin Garnet. Adam Sandler showed that he could really act in Punch Drunk Love, and he absolutely owns in Uncut Gems.</p>
<p><strong>One Cut of the Dead</strong></p>
<p>Without spoiling it, all I’ll say is this film went to fun places I didn’t expect, and was a delight throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Psycho Pass</strong></p>
<p>The episodes of this show already feel fairly cinematic, so stretching the show to nearly 2 hours felt right. It was super jarring to hear random English throughout the film though—at the start I thought I was accidentally watching a dub.</p>
<p><strong>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker</strong></p>
<p>Frankly <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/emperor-only-has-32504876">this post from Film Critic Hulk</a> covered my feelings well. I described it as a movie trying to fellate itself. Scenes rarely got to breathe, and the movie felt packed with fan service and confusing backtracking from Last Jedi. Also wow, they just dropped a bunch of character storylines.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Astra</strong></p>
<p>Space Brad Pitt! We’ve sent most leading men to space, but never Pitt (I didn’t check this too carefully). Also this had Donald Sutherland, who is a personal favorite. I appreciate that none of the things in space made sound at least. Sad dads in space. It was pretty, and exciting, but ultimately didn’t really give me much to latch onto.</p>
<p><strong>Ready or Not</strong></p>
<p>Lol can't wait to never get remarried. Rich people are the worst. Also it's a real bummer that &ldquo;satanists&rdquo; get such a bad wrap in a world where the christians are the ones actually harming children. Fuck the <a href="https://overcast.fm/+VX6lxzezs">satanic panic</a></p>

      <title>One year of newsletter</title>
      <link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-30-what-i-learned-from-sending-a-newsletter-this-year/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-30-what-i-learned-from-sending-a-newsletter-this-year/</guid>
      <description>Way back in February of 2019, I sent my first newsletter—a repost of a blog post about learning Japanese, then petered out for a bit. In July, I began sending weekly link emails, which I managed to keep up through the end of the year. It&#39;s been quite a fun Sunday activity, so I thought I&#39;d chat a bit about what the experience of weekly link writing was like.
Why links?</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Way back in February of 2019, I sent my first newsletter—a repost of a <a href="https://dillandfennel.substack.com/p/learning-japanese-again">blog post about learning Japanese</a>, then petered out for a bit. In July, I began sending <a href="https://dillandfennel.substack.com/p/weekly-links">weekly link emails</a>, which I managed to keep up through the end of the year. It's been quite a fun Sunday activity, so I thought I'd chat a bit about what the experience of weekly link writing was like.</p>
<h2 id="why-links">Why links?</h2>
<p>This year I got really stoked about Robin Sloan's <a href="https://desert.glass">Year of the Meteor</a> newsletter, which was full of incredible links that led me to read quite a bit, and even <a href="https://underarmbalm.com">change my deodorant brand</a>. Robin consistently finds interesting and strange things all over the web, and I thought, perhaps I could do the same. I struggle to find writing topics at times, but I still journal daily, and try to keep up a writing practice during the fallow uninspired periods. A weekly newsletter seemed like an excellent idea, but I tend to write less, and not more.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-digression">A brief digression</h3>
<p>I've found that writers are usually in one of two camps: the underwriters, and the overwriters. As a member of the former camp, I can crank out 1-2000 words in no time, but asking me to go beyond that is a torture, whereas my overwriting friends tend to need an editor to get down to 2000. Because of this the idea of writing a novel, or even a longish short story is really hard to consider—but short creative nonfiction? Hell yes.</p>
<h2 id="ok-back-to-the-links">Ok, back to the links</h2>
<p>Having realized I wasn't able to creatively write every week without a good prompt, I settled on looking around the web through the week, and sending my baubles to you, the reader, on Sundays. I settled on Sunday because it felt like a good time to have coffee and enjoy a little surfing around. Perhaps you do this reading on another day, but for me, Sundays are for coffee and words.</p>
<h2 id="finding-links">Finding links</h2>
<p>The links I share come from all over the place. Sometimes I reshare things I found in another newsletter, like <a href="https://www.densediscovery.com">Dense Discovery</a>, and other times, they come from my <a href="https://feedbin.com">long list of RSS feeds</a> (feel free to request my OPML file). I read quite a bit every day, both on and offline, so it really isn't hard to find a few tidbits to share.</p>
<h2 id="the-satisfaction-of-analytics">The satisfaction of analytics</h2>
<p>I don't spend a lot of time thinking about how many readers I've amassed (spoiler, not many), but I do love that I can see that folks generally <em>are</em> reading the emails I send out. There's a small sense of accomplishment when I know that someone has found something neat because I shared it. I really do love a recommendation, and it seems like some of you do as well.</p>
<h2 id="platforms">Platforms</h2>
<p>This year began on <a href="https://substack.com">Substack</a>, which seems like a decent platform, and has attracted <a href="https://www.shatnerchatner.com">more than</a> a <a href="https://grace.substack.com">few friends</a> as users. As someone who isn't really planning to  find success or payment via a newsletter, my main goals were something easy to use, and ideally something I could send content to directly from <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iAWriter</a>, my markdown editor of choice.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I was eager to switch to <a href="https://buttondown.email">ButtonDown</a> after reading about it via Robin Sloan. I love how both the <a href="https://www.notion.so/639bdb37786e489a960d4810ee6ce351?v=58ef759254094357bdb04d715e9c518b">roadmap</a> and <a href="https://buttondown.email/running-costs">costs</a> are fully public, and the developer responds really quickly via email. This small, sustainable app is something I'm really keen on supporting, as I love sustainable apps much more than venture-funded privacy-less hockey-stick comapnies. Plus using Working Copy and Shortcuts, I managed to build on top of their really <a href="https://api.buttondown.email/v1/schema">easy to use API</a>, and now have a one-button send draft to ButtonDown</p>
<h2 id="next-year">Next year</h2>
<p>My plan currently is to just <em>keep on keeping on</em> with this weekly links newsletter, and aspire to continuing monthly blog posts about longer topics. If you have things you'd love to see, or things you want to chat about, you know <a href="mailto:brookshelley+blog@gmail.com">how to reach me</a>.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic new year, and I'll see you next Sunday!</p>

      <description>This year I read 55 books and a lot of graphic novels. Fortunately, most of them were pretty great, which made it even harder to pick out my five favorite. I gravitated towards a lot of fantasy and sci-fi in 2019 as a nice way to escape or even think about a potentially scarier future. My plan to keep reading primarily female authors also paid off.
In no particular order, here’s the list:</description>

Fortunately, most of them were pretty great, which made it even harder to pick out my five favorite. I gravitated towards a lot of fantasy and sci-fi in 2019 as a nice way to escape or even think about a potentially scarier future. My plan to keep reading primarily female authors also paid off.</p>
<p>In no particular order, here’s the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Starless Sea</strong> — Erin Morgenstern</p>
<p>Her first book was great, her second was outstanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Future of Another Timeline</strong> — Annalee Newitz</p>
<p>It’s wild that two of my favorite books this year came out near the end of the year. Newitz created a fascinating time-travel technology, with an amazing world. Here’s to the Daughters of Harriet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Psychology of Time Travel</strong> — Kate Mascarenhas</p>
<p>More queer time travel? Hell yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gideon the Ninth</strong> — Tamsyn Muir</p>
<p>Lesbian necromancers in space. Ok, there’s a theme to most of these and it’s around queer ladies and space or time-travel. I’m here for it, and so glad the whole zombie thing is over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Noumenon</strong> — Marina J. Lostetter</p>
<p>Multi-generational spaced exploration? Yes, please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did more full-fledged reviews for each of these in the link at the start of this post, though as always my book and film reviews are short because I got my fill of analytical book essays in college.</p>
<h2 id="stand-out-comics">Stand-out comics</h2>
<ul>
<li>The whole X-Men relaunch! From Powers of X/House of X to the weekly series like X-Force, I’m stoked to be enjoying the X-Men again.</li>
<li>Paper Girls &amp; Wicked and Divine: These two series finished strong, and I’m excited to read through them again sometime.</li>
<li>Die! An amazing series that’s just kicking off. This feels like a fresh take on D&amp;D, so I’ll be glad to read more.</li>
<li>Shirokuma Cafe: the first series I can actually read in Japanese! This feels huge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kindle-oasis">Kindle Oasis</h2>
<p>This year I read a few physical books, but by and large I read on my Kindle Oasis. In addition to being great for bathtub reading (hi Japan), the one-handed reading makes laying in bed super comfortable. Plus, I’ve found the Kindle to be a pretty solid place to read manga. I still hope that Amazon actually pushes the envelope on these at some point, but until then, I’ll hold onto this one. If you want to think more about ebooks, <a href="https://medium.com/@craigmod/reconsidering-the-hardware-kindle-interface-3c54088bed9e">this is a great essay</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2020">2020</h2>
<p>There are quite a few books in my queue for 2020, and I’m especially excited about a new William Gibson novel! I’ll likely travel a bit more, and as I start to finish up my big kanji learning project, I’ll be able to read more in Japanese as well.</p>

      <description>A new backpack for everyday carry, and travel.
First Sight After first getting my new Bellroy sling, I fell in love with the delightful material for these bags. A few months later in Iitoya in Japan, I got to see their new Shift backpack in person, and almost bought one on the spot. that bag was a little larger than I need, but then I saw this. With the launch of the Studio Backpack, Bellroy has made an excellent bag that holds a little or a lot without every looking absurd.</description>

With the launch of the Studio Backpack, Bellroy has made an excellent bag that holds a little or a lot without every looking absurd.</p>
<h2 id="sizing">Sizing</h2>
<p>For quite a while, I’ve <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/11/06/devreltour-packing-list.html">brought my Topo Trip Pack</a> to work as it fits my coffee bottle, iPad, journal, and a few other things perfectly. Adding in a spare jacket could stuff it pretty tight, but I preferred that to hauling a bag that was typically too large. With the Studio Backpack, my everyday stuff fits well, with ample space, but the shallow depth of the bag means it looks nice even unloaded.</p>
<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>
<p>This is a slim, but tall-ish bag that measures 500L x 370W x 100D mm or 19.69”x14.57”x3.94”.</p>
<p>It has an 18-liter capacity, which while entry isn’t nearly as big feeling as my similarly-sized RYU Quick Pack. It weighs 650g or 1.43lbs, nearly half the weight of the <a href="https://ryu.com/shop/us/quick-pack/quick-pack-lux">RYU</a>, and only a little heavier than the 567g <a href="https://topodesigns.com/products/trip-pack?variant=946319253">Topo Trip Pack</a>.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this bag feels like a great balance between a daily size and one that I could fly around the world with.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/bellroysmall.jpg" alt="Bellroy Front Pocket"></p>
<p>This bag is a top-loader, with a generously-wide opening, and a fidlock magnetic closure I can open with one hand using the small fabric loop. This flap makes for an easy way to use the main compartment, while keeping the rain off of my stuff. On the outside, there’s a pocket a little bit lower than mid-way that zips shut, and has pockets for pens, AirPods, and a few other things along with a key loop on a long fabric loop. Usually, I keep a Hobonichi Weeks, a Kaweco fountain pen, house keys, AirPods Pro and my work badge in here.</p>
<p>Inside of the main bag area, there’s a laptop area that can hold up to a 16” MacBook Pro—the new one with the real escape key—or an iPad Pro of either size. The bottom of the bag is generously padded to keep your stuff safe, and the laptop sleeve ends before the bottom for more safety. On the front wall of the main bag opening there is another zipped compartment for glasses, cables, or other odds and ends that you don’t need as often.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/mainbellroy.jpg" alt="Bellroy Main Pocket"></p>
<h2 id="colors-and-materials">Colors and Materials</h2>
<p>I have the black version of this bag, which I find delightful, though if I could customize it, I might have chosen a light purple or blue interior instead of the tan it comes with from Bellroy. Bellroy won me over on the idea that a lighter or brighter interior helps in finding your gear, though as a top-loader, even bright fabric doesn’t help you dig at the bottom of the bag. The Venture Weave fabric feels very strange, but in a cool, high-end way, and does a good job shrugging off rain. There are leather accents in various places on the bag that give it a little extra luxury.</p>
<h2 id="rating">Rating</h2>
<p>This bag rules, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it for the past few weeks. I plan to take it on my next trip abroad, and likely won’t bring a separate daypack. I think this bag will be comfortable on a hike, or fully-loaded with my typical travel gear. If you need a bit more space, I highly recommend checking out Bellroy’s other larger version of this, the <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/shift-backpack/venture/moss">Shift pack</a>.</p>

      <description>It’s finally chilly hygge-weather in the Bay Area, so I’ve been reading a lot after returning from a long trip to Japan. I hope wherever you are, you’re warm and feel loved.
Books The Starless Sea &amp;ndash; Erin Morgenstern
I read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea.</description>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>The Starless Sea</strong> &ndash; Erin Morgenstern</p>
<p>I read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea. This is a book for those of us who love exploring, and digging into a fantastical tale.</p>
<p><strong>The Infinite Wait</strong> &ndash; Julia Wertz</p>
<p>My friend Jenny recommended this one a while ago, and I finally got around to reading it. I couldn’t put it down. It’s hilarious, sad, and very close to home. I’d never heard of Wertz until now, but I plan to immediately buy all her comics.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Another Timeline</strong> — Annalee Newitz</p>
<p>Wow. This book was a triumph, and seriously seals Newitz as a scifi master. I only wish I could explore this world for longer. A perfect blend of history, speculation, and feminism—this book imagines a world in which collective action is possible deep into the past. Dang.</p>
<p><strong>How to Do Nothing</strong> — Jenny Odell</p>
<p>Now that I've finally finished her book, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn't the self-help palp that so many books about your phone are, but instead a wildly revelatory piece on bioregionalism, art, mystery, and birds. So many cool birds. This is a book I had to sip, because every few pages were full of so many ideas I wanted to savor them. I learned quite a bit from Jenny in these pages, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. Don't worry if it takes you a while to read this, just buy a copy and meander through California through it.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow and Bone</strong> — Leigh Bardugo</p>
<p>This was a neat YA that ended far before I thought it would—my edition had almost 100 pages of previews after the book. I enjoyed the magic system, despite the unfortunate teen romance that tends to plague YA. I'll likely read more of this series, in hopes that it continues to build a cool world.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Knives Out</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, I wasn't feeling great so I missed a bit of this, but I think I got all the important bits. I really want to see this again in the near future. The overall tone of the film was fantastic, and the comedic hits were delightful.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Color</strong></p>
<p>The preview of this movie had me hoping it was a potential adaptation of NK Jeminson's Broken Earth trilogy, but alas, it wasn't. Fortunately, it was still a fun movie about family and mutant powers. I wish there was a little more substance to the whole film, but on the upside, the mood was pretty interesting. Also it's weird seeing a belter as a sheriff (please see the Expanse for more details).</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had this on my to-watch list for years, and finally decided to dive in. It was a beautiful and strange mediation on life, death, and family.</p>
<p><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate</strong></p>
<p>A nice return to form. This felt like a nice natural extension to Terminator 2, and while it wasn't a great film by any means, it was a fun romp with lots of goofy jokes, explosions, and Mackenzie Davis.</p>
<p><strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>This was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/485/">Incomparables</a>. I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.</p>

      <description>Another year has rushed past, and with it, another iPhone update and some changes to my phone since last year&#39;s setup. My use of a single screen of apps continues, with a few major and minor changes alongside.
I&#39;ve posted these for the past few years, so if you want to see what apps I was using in 2017, here you go.
Some things change 3 app dock—I moved my Twitter app out of my dock in order to spend less time on Twitter.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Another year has rushed past, and with it, another iPhone update and some changes to my phone since <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/12/14/2018-iphone-homescreen-update.html">last year's setup</a>. My use of a single screen of apps continues, with a few major and minor changes alongside.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/2019iphone.png" alt="2019 iPhone Screen"></p>
<p>I've posted these for the past few years, so if you want to see what apps I was using in <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/2017-homescreen-ac92817eae60">2017, here you go</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-change">Some things change</h2>
<p><strong>3 app dock</strong>—I moved my Twitter app out of my dock in order to spend less time on Twitter. I figured if I wanted to to launch it I could easily search for it, but perhaps by having it out of reach I wouldn't launch the app out of habit or boredom. This worked pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>Fantastical</strong>—Last year I said &ldquo;This is definitely the app I am most interested in replacing.&rdquo; I replaced it with <strong>iOS Calendar</strong> not too long after writing this post because of the cleaner look, date view icon, and a better visualization of my next meeting on my phone and watch. I also really hate how Fantastical uses space on the iPad. I still hope that someday Apple opens up the ability to change icons based on events or time, but until they do, I'll have a hard time moving away from the default calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Bear</strong>—I moved completely off of Bear in favor of <strong>iAWriter</strong>, largely due to <a href="https://workingcopy.app">Working Copy</a>, which is an excellent Git client for iOS devices, and means I can use iAWriter's file function to open up posts like this one that live in my personal blog's Drafts folder.</p>
<p><strong>Google Maps</strong>—I moved back to <strong>Apple Maps</strong>. In general Apple Maps got a lot better, and works better on my watch. Also, in Japan, Apple Maps often shows results from TabeLog, which tends to have much better local recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Tweetbot</strong>—I replaced this with the weird beta Twitter app <strong>twttr</strong>. It's hidden in a folder now to encourage me to not use it as often, and that is working pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>Fiery Feeds</strong>—<em><strong>Reeder 4</strong> came out</em> and it's amazing. I moved to Reeder 4 on all of my devices, and I love it. The read later feature has also replaced Safari's read later for me in all instances. I don't use Bionic reading, but it's a neat feature regardless. I continue to use <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> to back my RSS.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-stay-the-same">Some things stay the same</h2>
<p><strong>Overcast</strong> — Overcast is great. This year it just got better, from CarPlay, to the watch, to my phone. I am really excited for Marco to update for more Airplay 2 features as he mentioned in a recent episode of <a href="https://atp.fm/episodes/352">ATP</a>. There are other podcast apps out there, but for smart-speed, playlists, and everything else, there is only Overcast.</p>
<p><strong>Spark</strong>—I kept using Spark this year, especially as they updated for a great black-screened-OLED-friendly dark mode, and <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/blog/new-design-dark-mode-ios13">rethought their entire interface in 2.5</a>. This is a great email app on all my devices, and has fantastic keyboard support for iPadOS.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Music</strong>—I've barely opened Spotify all year. Apple Music keeps getting better, and it seems like more of my friends have moved over to it as well.</p>
<p><strong>Things</strong>—This app is how I keep track of all my work and personal tasks. It's incredible. Keyboard shortcuts are available on iOS and Mac, and in general this app is a great example of how a cross-platform app should function.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Photos</strong>—This app got a lot better in iOS 13, and I really enjoy it. Not much else to say.</p>
<p><strong>Slack</strong>—I work at Slack still, and it's still a great app.</p>
<p><strong>Single folder</strong>—65 extra apps live in this folder. They range from rarely-used travel apps for work, to translation apps, to video and banking apps. I don't <em>love</em> all of the apps in this folder, but I regularly go through them to make sure they're still needed.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-of-the-rest">The best of the rest</h2>
<p>A few of the apps that live inside my large catch-all folder and are opened via search.</p>
<p><strong>Working Copy</strong>—This app is amazing. In addition to functioning as a great Git tool, it also has syntax and code-highlighting for tons of languages. I don't work in Working Copy all the time, but when I'm iPad-only, I use it quite a bit for work and my personal projects.</p>
<p><strong>Google Fi</strong>—I moved to Google Fi last year from AT&amp;T largely due to the free and easy international roaming. It's great.</p>
<p><strong>Tsurukame</strong>—This is my daily second job. I spend around two hours a day in this app and reading in order to become fully literate in Japanese. As I write this, I'm at level 39, and have over 1300 Kanji above Guru level. Learning Japanese is super hard, but worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Plex</strong>—Lots of video sources live here. It's a great app, and I wish other video streaming services would learn from Plex's great example.</p>
<p><strong>1Password</strong>—All my passwords live here, and are super long and complex. Similar to Things, I don't think I could work the same way without 1Password.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Last year I suggested my list of apps might not shift much, but five of my major home screen apps changed due to updates and simplicity. I'm happy this year with the apps that I use and due to my requirements of quality Apple Watch, Mac, and iPadOS cross-platform functionality the bar is really high for other apps to knock these off of my phone. I'm very excited about iOS 14, especially with news that it might be more stable than the particularly rough iOS 13 release. Perhaps Apple will give more features to devs that unlock unimagined new functionality. We'll find out in 6 months.</p>

      <description>The Playlist Here&#39;s all the albums I really loved this year easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.
The Albums  Cheap Queen — King Princess  Bless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.
Emily Alone — Florist  A deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.</description>

<p><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/favorites-of-2019/pl.u-vp3jjIrk0xN">Here's all the albums I really loved this year</a> easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.</p>
<h2 id="the-albums">The Albums</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cheap Queen</strong> — King Princess</li>
</ol>
<p>Bless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Emily Alone</strong> — Florist</li>
</ol>
<p>A deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Interloper</strong> — Momma</li>
</ol>
<p>Just the right amount of harmonies and hooks to draw you into a strange and fun indie rock band.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Family Tree</strong> — Oh Land</li>
</ol>
<p>A gorgeous album from a Danish former dancer. I just love her voice—from the start the album has a haunting beauty.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Scholars</strong> — Buke &amp; Gase</li>
</ol>
<p>I've had every album Buke &amp; Gase put out on repeat for some time after their release, and dearly love their jangly, angular rock. This album doesn't disappoint.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Beast on Beast</strong> — Gabby's World</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first band I've listened to that has gone through three name changes, from Eskimeaux, to Ó, then finally Gabby's World. I've loved them the whole time, and find this to be especially good sad subway music for when you're a little bummed and riding home at night.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Placeholder</strong> — Hand Habits</li>
</ol>
<p>A complex jam album with fantastic guitars and vocals weaving in and out of downtempo songs.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Memory Streams</strong> — Portico Quartet</li>
</ol>
<p>I first heard this band at a vinyl bar in Oakland, and their latest album rules.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Trust In The Lifeforce Of The Deep Mystery</strong> — The Comet Is Coming</li>
</ol>
<p>Fantastic end of the world music. This is really strange, funky jazz, and I dig it. Many mornings start off with this album and some coffee.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Nowhere Now Here</strong> — MONO</li>
</ol>
<p>I've been stoked on MONO since high school, and was lucky enough to see them perform many times at Emo's (RIP) in Austin. They just keep on making fantastic music that vacillates softer beautiful sounds and driving melodies. Whether you're walking around the city or taking a train to another city, this album creates a gorgeous soundtrack for your life.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Patience</strong> — Manequin Pussy</li>
</ol>
<p>A chill mix of punk and indie rock jams. I think I first saw this band at a show/benefit for Bernie Sanders that I didn’t know was a benefit. It was a super washed crowd, but Manequin Pussy owned bones. This record rules.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>Crush on Me</strong> — Sir Babygirl</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m really enjoying the new influx of queer and lesbian pop music these days. This album is infectiously catchy and often hilarious. Put it on and enjoy the short bouts of sun this winter.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>Miss Universe</strong> — Nilüfer Yanya</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure how to describe this album, but it's a jam. A bit of r&amp;b, a bit of indie rock, and a lot of really solid tunes. I've put this album on a repeat a few times this year.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong>Hifalutin</strong> — Lowly</li>
</ol>
<p>Super dance-y-yet-downtempo album. I can throw this on for a variety of moods, and it seems to always suit them. There’s something about Denmark that must inspire people to make brilliant music—this album was recorded in a small warehouse near Aarhus.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li><strong>Weird</strong> — Juliana Hatfield</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh hey, an album that feels like I do sometimes: “I'm staying in/My hair’s not right/And if I go out/Somebody might
Take me for a functioning/Human being”. I’m sure I heard Hatfield before this album, but this is the one where she came together for me as an artist.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li><strong>Fibs</strong> — Anna Meredith</li>
</ol>
<p>This album is a solid jam. Anna Meredith's compositions feel important, weird, and powerful. I often listen to this album in the morning to wake up and feel better about the day.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li><strong>Four of Arrows</strong> — Great Grandpa</li>
</ol>
<p>For a sophmore effort this is a really fun, mature album. I like that they've moved from more straightforward poppy indie music to a little more melodic rock.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li><strong>Two Hands</strong> — Big Thief</li>
</ol>
<p>Honestly, the fact that Big Thief put out <em>two</em> incredible albums this year is wild to me. I love both of their 2019 records, but Two Hands especially keeps going back on the stereo. It's gorgeous. Jia Tolentino wrote about them recently, and I recommend <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-ordinary-brilliance-of-big-thief">reading her piece</a>.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li><strong>Any Human Friend</strong> — Marika Hackman</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;I've got BDE/I think it's a venereal disease&rdquo;. Ugh. This album is an instant lesbian classic. I've loved every album Hackman has put out, with That Iron Taste immediately pulling me in, and constantly being on rotation. I got to see her perform in Portland a few years back, and the show was outstanding. Between her soft vocal delivery, which whispers with poetry and sensuality, and the brutally raw lyrical content&hellip; just wow.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li><strong>Lost Wisdom Pt.</strong> — Mount Eerie</li>
</ol>
<p>After the utter devastation of his past two albums, this truly sad album about an impending divorce with beautiful guest vocals from Julie Doiron almost comes as a relief. This is a tragedy I can almost understand, feelings I have felt. Microphones and Mount Eerie have held me through many hard times, and this album is an excellent entry into their discography.</p>

      <description>As usual, when I go on a DevRel tour, I like to write about what I&#39;ve packed. This trip was a 3 week journey from Tokyo, through Kyoto, to Osaka, and back. As I write this, halfway through the trip, I feel very good about the amount of stuff I brought.

<h2 id="bags">Bags</h2>
<ul>
<li>RYU Quick Pack 18L</li>
<li>Topo Designs Trip Pack</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/photos/ryubag2019.jpeg" alt="bags"></p>
<p><img src="/photos/travelbag2019.jpeg" alt="bag2"></p>
<p>Last time I went to Japan, I brought the DSPTCH Waist Bag as my day bag, and my shoulders immediately regretted it. I think my days or a one-shoulder bag with a computer are pretty much over. This time I returned to my tried and true setup. I’ve reviewed or written about both of these bags previously.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/drybags2019.jpeg" alt="drybags"></p>
<ul>
<li>Two Sea-to-summit dry bags</li>
</ul>
<p>These are great for clothes and toiletries, and additionally ensure that even in a downpour I can keep a few things dry.</p>
<ul>
<li>One Topo Designs accessory bag</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/photos/drybagsinside.jpeg" alt="drybagsinsidebigbag"></p>
<p>This time around, I loaded my toothbrush and some other non-leaky toiletries into this bag because I noticed the metal tip of my electric toothbrush kept <em>almost</em> poking through my dry bag.</p>
<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/clothes.jpeg" alt="clothes"></p>
<h3 id="jackets">Jackets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mission Workshop Torre Windshell</li>
</ul>
<p>My daily jacket. I’ve got two of these and they’re awesome. Not quite waterproof, but warm enough, and water-resistant enough for a drizzle and temperatures between 7-20C (mid-40s to mid-60s F).</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcteryx Cordetta</li>
</ul>
<p>If it rains, I’m covered.</p>
<h3 id="shirts">Shirts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wool t-shirts from Ryu and Icebreaker</li>
</ul>
<p>A great way to stay dry and warm or cool. These wash easily and are comfy for all-day-travel.</p>
<h3 id="pants">Pants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two pairs of Outdoor Voices RecTrek pants</li>
</ul>
<p>I wear these to work daily, and they’re pretty ideal. Comfy, flexible, and a bit water-resistant. The pockets are also <em>huge</em> which means my phone fits easily in a front pocket.</p>
<h3 id="shoes-and-socks">Shoes and socks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blundstones</li>
<li>Bombas no-show</li>
</ul>
<p>These shoes go on and off pretty easily, and look nice enough for business meetings while still feeling good for longer walks. Half of this trip was a vacation, where I wandered around all day, including hiking. I almost went with my new KOIO shoes, but at the last minute, opted for slip-one with a <em>lot</em> of grip.</p>
<h3 id="underwear">Underwear</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wool stuff from Icebreaker</li>
</ul>
<p>Wool is the way to go. I’ve tried other solutions and they were nice enough, but ultimately, wool holds up the best and wicks super well.</p>
<h2 id="tech-gear">Tech gear</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/electronics2019.jpeg" alt="electronics"></p>
<ul>
<li>Kindle Oasis</li>
<li>Battery</li>
<li>USB-C -&gt; C, and Lightning: iPad and iPhone</li>
<li>USB-A -&gt; Watch</li>
<li>USB-A -&gt; Micro: Kindle</li>
<li>iPad Pro 10.5 w/ Smart Keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point, maybe I can travel with only USB-C cables, but that world doesn’t exist yet. Fortunately my external battery has a USB-C port and a USB-A port, so I use those two to charge my phone and watch at night. On the plane my USB-C to USB-C cable means I can top-up my iPad if I play too many games or get low mid-season of a tv show. It completely boggles the mind why the Kindle isn’t a USB-C device yet. Seriously. It’s 2019.</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>

      <description>Books To Be Taught, If Fortunate — Becky Chambers
This is one of the best sci-fi short novellas I’ve read in a while. It’s not quite hard SF, but I love all the little details. The characters are great, and just casually queer, and there’s just enough suspense to make it a real page-turner. A triumph.
The Guest Cat — Takashi Hiraide **
Definitely cried reading this one. I’m a sucker for Japanese cat literature for sure.</description>

<p><strong>To Be Taught, If Fortunate</strong> — Becky Chambers</p>
<p>This is one of the best sci-fi short novellas I’ve read in a while. It’s not quite hard SF, but I love all the little details. The characters are great, and just casually queer, and there’s just enough suspense to make it a real page-turner. A triumph.</p>
<p><strong>The Guest Cat</strong> — Takashi Hiraide <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>Definitely cried reading this one. I’m a sucker for Japanese cat literature for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Revenant Gun</strong> — Yoon Ha Lee</p>
<p>The final book in the Ninefox trilogy, and definitely the horniest one. If you military guys, there’s probably some fun for you in here. For me though, this was a great conclusion to a often confusing and wild series. I still don’t understand all of the math, but I love the world. There were some really interesting character choices here, and even though I wish we’d seen more of Cheris and Jedao chatting, the bits we did get were rad. This series was fantastic overall.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong> — William Gibson</p>
<p>A reread of a favorite. I might or might not partially owe Cayce for a major style inspiration for my daily wardrobe. This story has a lot of artifacts of the early oughts, but most of it feels delightfully timeless.</p>
<p><strong>Hollow Kingdom</strong> — Kira Jane Buxton</p>
<p>Still not sure how i feel about this book. I think the idea of the book was better than the execution.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>In the Shadow of the Moon</strong></p>
<p>A mid-flight watch on my way to Tokyo. Pretty interesting, engaging flick that gets weird.</p>
<p><strong>Parasite</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a lot I can say about this without spoiling the whole endeavor, but suffice it to say this movie is incredible. There’s <em>so much</em> going on in every shot, and the actors performances are incredible. This is a rare movie that just keeps building and building throughout. Truly one of the best directors working.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do in the Shadows</strong></p>
<p>A rewatch of an utter classic of mockumentary. So many quotable lines and absurdly delightful scenes. The last word in vampire media.</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Self Defense</strong></p>
<p>The dialog delivery was definitely from the Yorgos Lanthimos school of deadpan, and the general vibe was extremely absurdist. I loved this film. Quite a bit of this movie was unexpected, and had me cracking up. A genuinely odd delight.</p>
<p><strong>The Day Shall Come</strong></p>
<p>An utterly bizarre and fantastic satire about the very real lengths the state goes to in order to prop up folks with no real chance of committing “terrorist acts”. It’s worrying watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqUsiV8LPkM">this interview</a> to get more behind the scenes of this film. Morris makes seriously strange stuff, and this is no exception.</p>
<p><strong>High Life</strong></p>
<p>Space dads! I don’t know if this is a genre, but perhaps it should be since Interstellar, High Life, and Ad Astra all appear to answer: “what if dads, but in space”. However there was a <em>lot</em> of assault in this film&hellip; it’s largely about felons being jettisoned into space, and artificial insemination experiments, it turns out. If you like very grim space movies, this might be for you.</p>
<p><strong>Promare</strong></p>
<p>A wild visual ride with a rather bizarre (it’s Trigger, naturally) story of fire people and the folks who fight them. There’s mecha, tons of goofy jokes, and even though it felt a little long, it was fun.</p>

      <description>(this is a very earnest post, and if you&#39;re here for backpacks and travel, maybe skip this one)
Hey Brook,
This letter in a sci-fi tale would come to you out of the ether, dropping onto your iBook G3 on some particularly dark night of the soul. I&#39;m you, but 16 years older, and hopefully a little wiser.
(Spoiler alert)
The next few years will be a lot of fun, but also really, really tough.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>(this is a very earnest post, and if you're here for backpacks and travel, maybe skip this one)</p>
<p>Hey Brook,</p>
<p>This letter in a sci-fi tale would come to you out of the ether, dropping onto your iBook G3 on some particularly dark night of the soul. I'm you, but 16 years older, and hopefully a little wiser.</p>
<p>(Spoiler alert)</p>
<p>The next few years will be a lot of fun, but also really, really tough. You will lose friends and family to cancer, then to divorce and&hellip;</p>
<p>You transition. You finally do it, and it goes mostly ok! You don't talk to family anymore, but you probably saw that coming, and it's fine because you have friends who love and support you.</p>
<p>Your finances will get worse for a while. Really bad. You're going to spend a little while sleeping in your car and on folks&rsquo; couches. It sucks. You'll smoke too many cigarettes, and do some ridiculous stuff.</p>
<p>It works out.</p>
<p>Eventually, you get a job with folks who you really like, and they encourage you. You join a company that is doing amazing stuff with messaging (kind of like IRC, but way, way cooler—you'll see). After a year, you get a little bit of stock, and finally pay off your student loan debt that you'll have ground down for 13 years. It will feel great.</p>
<p>You'll see a therapist, and a doctor, and a dentist with a regular cadence. It will help. I promise.</p>
<p>You'll love, you'll lose, and you'll get back on that horse. Ultimately, you'll do a <em>lot</em> of reading and spend a lot of time with your best friend, a cat named Snorri. You and Snorri will travel from Austin, to Portland, to Oakland, with a <em>ton</em> of flights in between to Europe, Asia, Canada, and NYC.</p>
<p>I know what it feels like a lot of nights right now. It sucks. It's real, and you've had a hard time. Most people you know won't get it, and you deserve better. When you get older you'll know more people who've also gone through a lot of shit, and they'll be good listeners, and you'll listen a lot too. Don't stop loving, and don't stop trying to be open with your friends. It pays off more often than not. Your biggest asset is your heart. Don't lose it.</p>
<p>I love you, and I can't wait for you to get to where I am now. For all the good times, and the bad ones, just know I'm here in the future cheering you on.</p>

      <description>Media diet for September Books Gideon the Ninth — Tamsyn Muir
Queer space necromancers! Queer space necromancers! OMG. This book was utterly bizarre, and a hell of a lot of fun. I’m a fan of low-tech future space stories, where for the most part the book seems more like fantasy than sci-fi, so this book was a joy. Plus there was necromancy! Apparently there are going to be two more books in this series, which is a delightful thing to learn, because I want to stretch out and learn more about this strange universe.</description>

<p><strong>Gideon the Ninth</strong> — Tamsyn Muir</p>
<p>Queer space necromancers! Queer space necromancers! OMG. This book was utterly bizarre, and a hell of a lot of fun. I’m a fan of low-tech future space stories, where for the most part the book seems more like fantasy than sci-fi, so this book was a joy. Plus there was necromancy! Apparently there are going to be two more books in this series, which is a delightful thing to learn, because I want to stretch out and learn more about this strange universe.</p>
<p><strong>Raven Strategem</strong> — Yoon Ha Lee</p>
<p>All the world building and deciphering of the strange calendrical system paid off in full in this book. Getting a hint of what Jedao/Cheris might want at the end of Ninefox, this book deals with the aftermath of a dangerously peerless tactician let loose in the galaxy. I enjoyed all the strange details of the hexarchs, and imagining what each moth looked like. It’s been a minute since a sci-fi book got me so excited. This series can feel like a slog at first, but I think it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Ninefox Gambit</strong> — Yoon Ha Lee</p>
<p>This was one of the more challenging sci-fi books I've read in a while. Ultimately, figuring out what the hell was going on was well worth-it, but the first half or so was a frantic dog paddle to stay afloat. The world of NineFox Gambit is deeply strange, with technology that borders on magic that requires an empire to hold to a strict calendar for it to function. We follow a rad lady, with a homicidal general trapped in her head as she runs what seems like a suicide mission. I'm excited to read the rest of this series.</p>
<p><strong>Masterworks</strong> — Simon Jacobs</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/09/03/Masterworks-Review.html">Long form review</a></p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></p>
<p>The idea of this movie made me <em>very</em> anxious. Middle school is rough, and I was on edge for most of the film wondering if something very bad would happen, or if Checkov's AR-15 would reappear. <strong>Spoiler Alert</strong> No. There're definitely some sad moments, and some very tender and sweet ones, but no one big terrible event occurs. This isn't that kind of movie. Instead, Eighth Grade perfectly encapsulates how nervous and awkward we felt in our youth, and just how embarassed we were by our parents. I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Between Two Ferns</strong></p>
<p>I love the parallel world of these bizarre and failed actors. I haven’t seen very many episodes of the web show, but this was pretty fun.</p>
<p><strong>Aniara</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR: Low-budget sci-fi cruise ship. This movie reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode, at least in its premise. I really enjoy movies where something goes horribly awry, and &ldquo;what if we're stuck in space forever&rdquo; definitely meets that criteria, but unlike the Twilight Zone, there's no big twist, just a slow sadness. There's a certain charm to the fact that it's Swedish as well. Plus, there’s space lesbians. We’re everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Mega Time Squad</strong></p>
<p>Completely silly and fun. Low-budget time travel movies are often awesome (think Primer), but what if it was also a very low-brow comedy? Sweet as.</p>
<p><strong>Booksmart</strong></p>
<p>Wow, I really should've watched this in the theater. This movie ruled. Outstanding cast, hilarious from start to finish. I want so many more amazing comedies that center rad women. More. Lesbian. Characters. In. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Universe: The Movie</strong></p>
<p>I'm not super fond of musicals, and this was most certainly a musical. Generally, I've enjoyed Steven Universe, but more so when it's weird, and not saccharine. This movie leaned more towards the latter, so it was cute, but not really my bag. If singing and supportive friendships are your favorite part of the show, you'll love the movie. TL;DR your ex's polycule adopts you.</p>
<p><strong>Godzilla: King of Monsters</strong></p>
<p>Ridiculous, but exactly what I expected. A bit of Godzilla, a bit of the Core. I'm fascinated by the idea that &ldquo;eco-terrorists&rdquo; have wide-reaching military power, lol. Shin Godzilla is still the best movie in the series, hands down, but this was a silly action romp.</p>
<p><strong>MI-5</strong></p>
<p>I fondly remember the British show <em>Spooks</em>, which ended in 2011. This movie was a nice reminder of the great things about that silly spy show.</p>

      <description>A return to form This year marked my 4th XOXO, and my 3rd at Revolution Hall. Last year was big, which meant it was even harder to wave at, or spend time with the other amazing attendees I knew. This year, it felt just right. I still waved at too many folks, and wished I had time to have a number of small dinners over the next year instead of so many “hey, I see you, sorry I’ve gotta run!</description>

<p>This year marked my 4th XOXO, and my 3rd at Revolution Hall. Last year was <em>big</em>, which meant it was even harder to wave at, or spend time with the other amazing attendees I knew. This year, it felt just right. I still waved at too many folks, and wished I had time to have a number of small dinners over the next year instead of so many “hey, I see you, sorry I’ve gotta run!” However, I got to spend time with a smallish group of friends, see all the talks I wanted, and even play some <a href="http://www.killerqueenblack.com">amazing</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ_I8SSVKto">new</a> <a href="https://play.date">games</a>.
If you’ve never been to XOXO, and you make things on the internet, and enjoy building relationships, this is a great place for you.</p>
<h2 id="day-one">Day one</h2>
<p>As usually, the first day of the conference was a social one—with Glitch doing an <a href="https://glitch.com/~appy-hour">Appy Hour</a>, and Panic showing off the <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>. It was super cool seeing all the strange community games and creations of Glitch users, along with a few presentations, and the Playdate is something I can’t wait to own. Topped-off with a dinner at Kachka, a lot of upcoming games, and one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/9/9/20849172/unraveled-how-to-calculate-pet-hp-hit-points">most hilarious videos</a> I’ve seen in a while, wherein Brian Gilbert attempts to calculate his pet’s HP, Friday was a delight. The weather held, the <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1171647388001406976?s=21">toilets were uniquely chill</a>, and the layout of the festival ensure I could wander and find neat things.</p>
<h2 id="day-two">Day two</h2>
<p>One of the first pieces of advice I’d give anyone going to a multi-day festival is “don’t drink too much on the first night”. I didn’t take my own advice. I wasn’t ill, but a combination of 3 glasses of wine and too little sleep meant 10am felt <em>very</em> early. Thankfully my hotel had Proud Mary coffee, and XOXO had Deadstock. A breakfast sandwich from Fried Egg I’m in Love completed my resurrection.</p>
<p>Day two felt a little longer, as I sat through every talk, alternately crying and laughing. A definite emotional rollercoaster. Helen and Hrishikesh were excellent hosts, and seeing their banter develop over the weekend makes me hope they host again next year. I missed the Andy’s camaraderie at times, but I hope <em>only</em> being responsible for the whole festival was a nice change from also MCing.</p>
<p>Lunch was Basilisk. Unbeatable fried chicken I eat every time I visit Portland. Yes, even when I’m there for hours.</p>
<p>Favorite talks from Saturday: Harry Brewis (very funny guy who I didn’t know anything about beforehand), Hundred Rabbits (delightful French Canadian vegan sailors), and Soleil Ho (what happens when you become the representation?!).</p>
<p>After a quick dinner, I sat down for a night of unforgettable podcasts. I watched a man interview a chainsaw, and was utterly destroyed by Demi and Miel with special guests Neil and Mike doing Ray Parker Jr’s Ghostbuster song. The number of folks I heard singing “bustin’ makes me feel good” after this podcast taping tells me I wasn’t alone.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-closing-time">Day 3 (Closing time)</h2>
<p>Coffee. Sandwich. Almost there. I was wiped at this point, but the talks were delightful. Mikki Kendall, Jenny Odell, and Rhea Butcher were my favorites from Sunday. A great mix of comedy and art. Food highlights were Navarre (another favorite), and dinner at Sardine Head. OMG Sardine Head. Oxidated white wine. Salt-cured anchovy. Dang.</p>
<p>The karaoke list was full by the time my friends and I got back from dinner, and a cab ride that included an episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1170902500083322880?s=21">King of the Hill</a>. It was fun watching various speakers and friends sing Pavement, Lizzo, and of course, the Ghostbuster’s theme. I ended my night with my friends Jenny and Joe, drinking on the balcony at my hotel. Our friend André’s room was right by the balcony, and he wandered out mid-way through. That moment of kismet was generally how the whole conference felt—friends wandering by, saying hi, and going on adventures.</p>
<h2 id="a-great-year">A great year</h2>
<p>XOXO at its best feels like what I imagine a community <em>should</em> feel like. It’s full of new people, old people, dear friends, and acquaintances. If XOXO was every day, I would lose my mind, but once a year, it feels incredible to be surrounded by so many people I care about, as we’re inspired together by talks, art, and each other. I’m so glad I got to go to Portland, for the first time as a non-resident, for XOXO. I can’t wait for another year of this magical festival, and hope many of the same folks will get to attend. My only regret is that I can’t somehow bring Snorri with me too. He’d hate it.</p>

      <description>I wish I knew more about art. Reading the titular story, I found myself reaching for my phone to understand each scene in the strange and delightful post-apocalyptic tale. As I held the painting in my mind, and explored the flooded wastes with Liam, Nell, and Co. I found myself enamored by the framing. How often are our relationships held together by a retelling of an old picture? Are we always trying to build a life out of the classics of our youth?</description>
      <content:encoded><p>I wish I knew more about art. Reading the titular story, I found myself reaching for my phone to understand each scene in the strange and delightful post-apocalyptic tale. As I held the painting in my mind, and explored the flooded wastes with Liam, Nell, and Co. I found myself enamored by the framing. How often are our relationships held together by a retelling of an old picture? Are we always trying to build a life out of the classics of our youth? There’s a survey of life, and an exploration of lost moments in these vignettes.</p>
<p>The opening tale of this collection plants us in Ohio, a place, we see, where even supportive friends or loved ones can’t save you from the yawning abyss. The suburban Olive Garden echoes in my mind with all the breadsticks I absorbed through my high school years. These youth were me, and the chasm felt real then too. From there, we follow a mother who lost a son, and a sliver of a life exploring a name—just enough of both to leave the reader wanting more. Then, a journey through art, mentioned above. It’s strange and beautiful, and a great opportunity to learn about the great works of fine art, if like this reviewer, you largely skipped-out on art class.</p>
<p>Finally, we readers are washed up on the shore, like so many dead fish, with a man watching a lodge, and time-displaced, dealing with an all-too-familiar moldy bathroom. A word of warning: if you’ve lived in the the Pacific Northwest, the squelch of wet tile will be all too real. This novella is reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, or another fairy tale of exploring a new land. The phrase “crotchal belch” made me laugh out loud. There are so many great turns of phrase in Masterworks. The story propelled me forward, alternately laughing and cringing. I wanted the protagonist to seize his agency, and change in the ways he so clearly desired. I find these characters at turns fascinating and deeply frustrating. There were so many places where I yelled, “say something” in my head, but this isn’t a story of success, but learning and remembering.</p>
<p>On the whole, I loved this book. Masterworks, by Simon Jacobs, is a fantastic collection of imagination, and creative bombast. At times it leans into magical realism, in others outright fantasy. There a slightly disjointed nature to these stories, as they’re collected over years of writing, and lead me to hope Simon writes more—a novel perhaps—in the future.</p>

      <description>Books The Light Brigade — Kameron Hurley
Definite Catch-22 vibes throughout this book, with a hearty helping of Starship Troopers. If you like time-travel and space military, this is a solid read.
The Psychology of Time Travel — Kate Mascarenhas
Ah, time-travel and lesbians: two of my favorite things. This book was an interesting take on time-travel, and inevitable meeting of your future and past selves. I really enjoyed the small strange moments between characters.</description>

<p><em>The Light Brigade</em> — Kameron Hurley</p>

<p><em>The Psychology of Time Travel</em> — Kate Mascarenhas</p>
<p>Ah, time-travel and lesbians: two of my favorite things. This book was an interesting take on time-travel, and inevitable meeting of your future and past selves. I really enjoyed the small strange moments between characters.</p>
<p><em>From the Fatherland with Love</em> — Ryu Murakami</p>
<p>One of the more bonkers books that Ryu Murakami has written, it combines both  his fascination with violence with a scathing satire on bureaucracy. I couldn’t put this down and found myself alternatively horrified and laughing.</p>
<p><em>The Book of Joan</em> — Lydia Yuknavitch</p>
<p>This was a very strange, disjointed tale of a post-apocalyptic redemption narrative. I can’t say that I know a lot about Joan of Arc, but I trust that Yuknavitch drew from her history to write this. I can’t decide quite how I feel about this, but I will say that I found the author’s obsession with genitals and gender rather much. Does the author dislike trans people? Was she attempting to suggest that they are leading us to a dark, genderless place? This was unclear. There was a blurb that claimed this author is at the forefront of writing about gender fluidity, and I would say instead, she is mired deep in the past.</p>
<p><em>Magic for Liars</em> — Sarah Gailey</p>
<p>Ah! I loved this book. What a brilliant marriage of noir and magic school. I devoured it in two sittings with a big grin on my face. Gailey is a delight, and after seeing them read the first chapter in person, I couldn’t wait to dive in. I hope they write more novels soon.</p>
<p><em>River of Teeth</em> — Sarah Gailey</p>
<p>What an absurd romp. This would’ve worked better for me if I enjoyed cowboys or the romance of men, but still it was fun enough. I don’t think I’ll read the next few books in this series, but I’m certain my friend in book club will devour them. Well-written and imagined, just not for me.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></p>
<p>I read this comic when I was younger, and it’s kind of neat to see it made into a live action film. I still can’t get over the uncanny valley eyes that Rose Salazar’s character has though. Overall, this was ￼￼a fun action film.</p>
<p><em>The Predator</em></p>
<p>I’ve seen folks watching this on a bunch of planes in the past year or so, and as a long-time fan of the Predator, I entered into it grudgingly. The first two films were tight thrillers, but at this point, I can’t tell what the series wants to be. If you can watch this for free, I guess it’s ok?</p>
<p><em>Bad Times at the El Royale</em></p>
<p>This was fun enough, with a pretty good ensemble cast. Nothing really stuck out as excellent, and in a few ways it felt like a less-ambitious Tarantino film.</p>
<p><em>The Quake</em></p>
<p>A good reminder that disaster movies don’t need to have the glitz and glam of a big budget Hollywood film. This sequel to The Wave was rather slowly-paced, but exciting as it picked up steam.</p>
<p><em>Killing of a Sacred Deer</em></p>
<p>Wow, this was an eerie film. At this point I’ve enough of Yorgos Lanthimos’ films that I enter into them thinking “what’s the strange twist?” This film delivered on that quite well. I love the strange, flat performance Lanthimos actors provide—they lure you into this world with everything just /a bit/ off. Also the young man in the film was /haunting/.</p>
<p><em>First Reformed</em></p>
<p>I went into this movie thinking &ldquo;it's about religion and maybe climate change&rdquo;. That covers it to a degree, but beyond that is so much truth and sadness. This was a grim, beautiful film that struck me right at the core—both as an ex-religious person, and someone who often mourns for the end of life for so many folks effected by climate change. The movie, at it's core, asks if there's any forgiveness for our destruction of the planet, for our destruction of humanity. I don't have an answer to that question. This film however, was excellent.</p>
<p><em>The Lobster</em></p>
<p>I can now say that I have indeed considered the Lobster. After seeing The Favourite earlier this year, I decided to go back to watch Yorgos Lanthimos‘ other films. I’m glad I did. This was fantastic.</p>
<p><em>The Ceremony (儀式)</em></p>
<p>A bizarre 70s Japanese film about family, duty, and incest. Reading about this film, it seems like much of it was meant to be an indictment of the older generation, as well as the younger generation’s unwillingness to speak out against tradition. As a film, it’s truly strange, but also brutal in its methodical breakdown of the protagonist.</p>
<p><em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</em></p>
<p>A very silly buddy comedy. They talk about balls a bit too often for a movie with two 50 year old protagonists, but it was fun at times. There’s very little connection between this and Fast &amp; Furious, but if you like Stratham &amp; The Rock, you’ll have fun.</p>

      <description>As my clothes gradually wear out, I’m slowly trying to replace everything with my current favorites. This makes for a very simple wardrobe that works for all 4 seasons.
Lots of this stuff is wool, all of it is pretty durable, and when possible I tried to find vendors that were environmentally friendly and smaller.
Shirts 4 tank tops — These are fantastic tank tops. They wick well, don’t get stinky, and look good enough to wear outside of the gym.</description>

      <description>Books Dune — Frank Herbert
A classic. I read this when I was a kid, but hadn’t reread it since then. It’s weird, long, and great. The rest of the series is supposed to be bizarre, so I can’t wait. The spice must flow.
Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead — Sara Gran
An alright mystery book, but more than a few times, I think the author attempted to add grit but just ended up sounding like a very awkward narrator.</description>

<p><strong>Dune</strong> — Frank Herbert</p>
<p>A classic. I read this when I was a kid, but hadn’t reread it since then. It’s weird, long, and great. The rest of the series is supposed to be bizarre, so I can’t wait. The spice must flow.</p>
<p><strong>Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead</strong> — Sara Gran</p>
<p>An alright mystery book, but more than a few times, I think the author attempted to add <em>grit</em> but just ended up sounding like a very awkward narrator. Also points off for a trans slur—like, c’mon, I don’t care who your narrator or, or how much of a fuck-up she is, leave us alone.</p>
<p><strong>Paradise Rot</strong> — Jenny Hval</p>
<p>A strange story of roommates, love, and interior mold. I hope Hval writes more strange books.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>The Farewell</strong></p>
<p>I cried a lot during this film. Awkwafina did a fantastic job, and it's cool to see a major US release mostly in Mandarin. If you've recently lost a grandparent, or have gone through family illness, this might just hit you really hard.</p>
<p><strong>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</strong></p>
<p>This was a very strange movie, even by Tarentino's standards. A mix of fake show clips, stories of a man and his valet, and glimpses into the Manson family. I laughed quite a bit, and generally found this movie to be a blast.</p>
<p><strong>A Vigilante</strong></p>
<p>This was hard to watch. It was very well done, and intensely paced, but the abuse in the films was painful. There’s a grim morality in this film, and a certain catharsis in seeing abusers punished, but fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Thoroughbreads</strong></p>
<p>A fantastically creepy film about ennui and friendship. I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Spiderman: Far from Home</strong></p>
<p>This is exactly what I want from a superhero movie: fun. The stakes were much smaller than an Avengers movie, despite this film happening in the aftermath of both the “blip” and many deaths, and that’s a good thing. Instead of world-changing events, we got to enjoy Peter and his classmates goofing around in Europe, and the zany world of Mysterio. I loved this movie. The action was exciting, and the jokes were silly and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Hospitalitié (歓待)</strong></p>
<p>A strange movie reminiscent of a short story I read years ago where. house guests slowly take over a family’s home. It’s dark, funny, and a poignant commentary on xenophobia.</p>
<p><strong>Midsommar</strong></p>
<p>Wow. What a gorgeous, twisted, wild film. From the music to the ultra-bright summer of it all, I loved this movie. If you’re quite squeamish, give it a pass. Otherwise, skål!</p>

<p>I’ll still write here as often as I can, but I found myself wanting a quicker way to write weekly, without needing a <em>big</em> thing to blog about, or something to review. My monthly media diets will still be posted to brookshelley.com as well. It’s been fun to do tiny reviews of books and movies, even if it’s mostly for my own memory of what I consumed in a year. Not using Letterboxed or Goodreads for this was a very conscious decision—I want to own and control my own data. If you keep track of this kind of stuff yourself, or run your own little slice of the internet, I’d love to <a href="mailto:brookshelley@gmail.com">hear about it</a>!</p>

      <description>Books The Fated Sky — Mary Robinette Kowal
More cool space stuff! I enjoyed the pacing more in this book, and despite the frustration with very 50s attitudes that still pervade the modern world, I enjoyed journeying with these two books to mars.
The Bone Clocks — David Mitchell
A delightful collision of strange characters across time. This book is just fantastical enough to scratch my sci-fi itch, and literary enough to keep me satisfied.</description>

<p><strong>The Fated Sky</strong> — Mary Robinette Kowal</p>
<p>More cool space stuff! I enjoyed the pacing more in this book, and despite the frustration with very 50s attitudes that still pervade the modern world, I enjoyed journeying with these two books to mars.</p>
<p><strong>The Bone Clocks</strong> — David Mitchell</p>
<p>A delightful collision of strange characters across time. This book is <em>just</em> fantastical enough to scratch my sci-fi itch, and literary enough to keep me satisfied. I hadn’t read Michell in a while, but diving back in was like slipping on a well-fitting shoe. My only complaint is that I got a bit sick of “psycho-“ being applied to every magic thing, as it felt a bit too much like RPG spell naming, lol.</p>
<p><strong>An Elderly Lady Is Up to No Good</strong> — Helene Tursten</p>
<p>Delightfully wicked tales of a murderous octogenarian. I laughed, and cringed in turn. A short, strange read.</p>
<p><strong>The Calculating Stars</strong> — Mary Robinette Kowal</p>
<p>This is an interesting alternate history where a disaster changes the fate of the planet, and accelerates the space race. Unfortunately, no disaster can change the rampant misogyny and racism of the men in power in this world. The protagonist, Dr. York, is a calculator, and dreams of being an astronaut, after years of flying planes as a WASP. I’m excited to read the sequel, but so many of the scenes of men being jerks to everyone else were pretty frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Exhalation: Stories</strong> — Ted Chiang</p>
<p>Chiang is one of the only authors I’ve read that truly puts the “speculative” into speculative fiction. Combining a curiosity about math, physics, and philosophy, Exhalation’s stories show a very adept storyteller playing with quite a few ideas. Each story is so different, and yet similarly great. I really hope Chiang writes a novel at some point, because I want to roam around his world’s for much longer.</p>
<p><strong>Sourdough</strong> — Robin Sloan</p>
<p>A fun book on getting into a new hobby, and getting out of tech. I’m not a baker, but I really liked how Robin described the baking process. There weren’t many characters with real depth, but our protagonist was fun.</p>
<p><strong>The Book of M</strong> — Peng Shepherd</p>
<p>An interesting take on a plague/zombie-style post-apocalypse. I had trouble putting this book down, and the story kept me reading most of the day. I got to hear Shepherd read from her book at a literary event in the bay, and I’m very glad I did—this book ruled.</p>
<p><strong>Noumenon: Infinity</strong> — Marina J. Lostetter</p>
<p>This series ruled. There were pretty significant characters who were trans, or differently abled, and I feel like they were written pretty dang well. The space exploration and discovery plotlines split and re-intertwined many times, and always kept me fascinated. Definitely one of the most interesting sci-fi series I’ve read in years.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Force Majeure</strong></p>
<p>A slow burn of a movie. Largely, this is about a family, and a father who is kind of a shit. Tormund from GoT shows up. Lots of skiing. Grey fog. Fin.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph Breaks the Internet</strong></p>
<p>This was super cute, with a nice mix of weird jokes and internet references. It’s wild how many amazing actors they got to join in the strange fun. If you liked the first film, you’ll enjoy the new one.</p>
<p><strong>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</strong></p>
<p>This movie wasn't as bad as critics have said, which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Out of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Last_Stand"> two treatments</a> of the Dark Phoenix, I think this one was better. The story was a bit odd, but overall, it was fun and a lot of shit blew up. B- summer pap.</p>
<p><strong>Starfish</strong></p>
<p>A largely solo trek through grief, loneliness, and the end of the world. The soundtrack to Starfish was excellent, as was the performance of Ginny Gardner. Without spoiling anything, it’s best to say this movie goes in interesting directions and is shot beautifully.</p>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>Good Omens</strong></p>
<p>The best parts of this show were the weirdly delightful friendship scenes between Sheen and Tennant. I hadn't read this book, but the story moved along at a good clip, and remained strange and funny enough to delight me.</p>
<p><strong>Bake-Off: Professionals</strong></p>
<p>I watched two seasons of this show this month—the second season is currently airing. It's got the drama and silliness of GBBO, but with teams of two, and A &amp; B groups that whittle down for a final set of showdowns. Liam does a great job hosting, and just like GBBO this show is a warm and fun thing to watch while unwinding.</p>

      <description>It’s probably clear by now that I love my iPad Pro. I travel with it, write on it, and practice Japanese on it. When Apple announced iPadOS, it suddenly seemed liked my dream of only using my iPad had come true.
Major updates New home screen With a glance at the home screen, it’s clear that this isn’t iOS 12. Onscreen widgets isn’t exactly revolutionary, but it saves me a slide-over every time I want to check the weather, or which meeting I’m headed to next.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>It’s probably clear by now that I <em>love</em> my iPad Pro. I <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/03/13/travel-kit-update.html">travel</a> with it, <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/05/02/On-Notes-and-ToDos.html">write on it</a>, and <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/01/27/learning-kanji-again.html">practice Japanese</a> on it. When Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/">iPadOS</a>, it suddenly seemed liked my dream of only using my iPad had come true.</p>
<h2 id="major-updates">Major updates</h2>
<h3 id="new-home-screen">New home screen</h3>
<p>With a glance at the home screen, <img src="/photos/ipadhome.jpg" alt="photo of home screen with slide-over widgets"> it’s clear that this isn’t iOS 12. Onscreen widgets isn’t exactly revolutionary, but it saves me a slide-over every time I want to check the weather, or which meeting I’m headed to next. It’s pretty cool, and even though it’s in some ways a catch-up to what other platforms have had for a while, I dig it.</p>
<h3 id="copy--paste--select">Copy &amp; paste &amp; select</h3>
<p>Copy and pasting also get a refresh in iPadOS, with three-finger gestures copying, cutting, and pasting. I’m not sure how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18654314/apple-ipad-os-ipados-wwdc-first-look-windows-usb-user-interface-new-features">intuitive it is</a>, but for power-users at least, it should work quite well. I’ve gotten somewhat used to the gestures already. Multiple taps allow for some cool selection specificity, though occasionally this feels more frustrating as I struggle to remember how many taps to select a word. I think this will get better with practice</p>
<h3 id="swipe-to-type">Swipe to type</h3>
<p>Ever since I started practicing kanji for an hour or two every day, I noticed I was getting repetitive strain on my thumb and hand. I’m not sure how much this new swipe-to-type will help, but I’m enjoying the faster typing it enables.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-safari">Desktop Safari</h3>
<p>This single change is the reason iPadOS is a massive update for so many of us. Desktop versions of websites mean I can finally use Google Docs, or Notion, or Figma without pulling out my MacBook Pro at work. In testing, it seems like it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652163/google-docs-ipad-ipados-safari-apple-wwdc-2019">really works</a>, which rules. The first version of the OS just launched, so I’d expect we might see even better support between now and the launch of the OS in the fall.</p>
<h3 id="sign-in-with-apple">Sign-in with Apple</h3>
<p>This sign-in upgrade will come to iPad and iPhone, and is an amazing privacy boost for everyone using an iOS device. By removing the need to give your email address to every service I use, Apple is potentially saving me hundreds of unsubscribes and delete from inbox actions, not to mention all the scraping and ad targeting. I’m very stoked.</p>
<h2 id="minor-changes">Minor changes</h2>
<h3 id="dark-mode">Dark mode</h3>
<p>I love dark mode, don’t get me wrong, but this update is a small change compared to the rest of the amazing stuff packed into iPadOS.</p>
<h3 id="files-updates">Files updates</h3>
<p>Column view, quick actions, more metadata, and a downloads folder all mean better file management without a desktop. Apple also added the ability to use thumb drives and hard drives in the USB-C drive, which isn’t really something I need, but seems to be a big deal to a lot of folks.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest">The rest</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/features/">The list goes on and on</a></p>
<h2 id="what-it-means-for-me">What it means for me</h2>
<p>With iPad OS, I can’t think of a single thing I do on my Mac that I can’t do on my iPad with the exception of working with a very large Github repo (just try downloading and updating a 6gb repo over WiFi, yow). With the addition of Catalyst apps on Mac, I hope that even more developers will devote energy to making powerful and fun iPad apps in the future. This fall will likely bring device updates with minor spec bumps, and likely this time I’ll snag a Cellular version so I can take advantage of <a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6330195?hl=en">Google Fi’s data sim</a>. Until now I’ve always been fine with tethering my iPad to my phone, but international travel makes that impossible due to Google’s restrictions, and since it’s essentially a free add-on, it seems like a no-brainer.</p>
<p>As of this year, I carry my iPad to most meetings, and almost always bring it instead of my Mac on trips—even for work. This new OS ensures that this will keep being the case. Macs will keep being a great option for my desk at work, but more and more, the iPad and the iPhone are where I prefer to do my computing.</p>
<p>If you haven’t checked out an iPad in a while, this fall will be a really good time to do so. You might not love it as much as I do, but it might surprise you.</p>

      <content:encoded><p>The search for the best, most optimized, beautiful, light, and pleasing things.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-search">Why do we search?</h2>
<p>Scrolling through my RSS feeds, I’m reminded daily that so much <em>stuff</em> exists. I subscribe to newsletters for fashion, backpacks, apps, and general tech, and every single one has an endless march through the days of new things. This <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/ulysses-16-adds-powerful-split-view-editing-on-ipad-plus-ghost-publishing/">app</a> has <em>two columns</em> for editing! This <a href="https://www.carryology.com/liking/industry/best-new-gear-march-2019/">backpack</a> is “able to transition from work to play and travel.” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bombas-socks-review">These</a> are the <em>best socks</em>.</p>
<p>I could go on.</p>
<p>The search for the best thing is best represented by the website <a href="https://thewirecutter.com">The Wirecutter</a>, with its incredibly thorough reviews of the <em>best</em> things in almost every category you can imagine. Started by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lam">a guy</a> and his friends to get out of the grind of tech reporting, they began to painstakingly investigate categories of tech, gear, and housewares to recommend one thing you could buy. My friend’s homes are filled with these <em>best</em> things. Hell, mine is too. They’re right most of the time, save for when taste or niche need intervenes. But why do we care?</p>
<p>Supposedly, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3043858/the-science-of-why-you-should-spend-your-money-on-experiences-not-thing">experiences make us happier than stuff</a>, but we still buy a good amount of stuff. Talking with friends, it seems like most of us like to think we’re getting a deal—by buying the <em>best</em> thing, we’re ensuring that our dollar goes furthest. The single thing we’re buying is categorically superior, and knowing that means we can stop looking, secure in the knowledge that we’ve made the <em>right decision</em>. And yet, I still browse these sites.</p>
<p>There’s a sense, at least for me, that something could be better. A new thing might suit my needs, or a specific complaint better. Yes, I have a raincoat, but do I have one I can wear near a campfire? Actually, <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/04/08/minimal-travel-clothing.html#jacket">yes, yes I do</a>. In an effort to be minimal in my ownership of things, I’ve also bought quite a few of them. The irony is not lost on me.</p>
<h2 id="the-happiness-factor">The happiness factor</h2>
<p>Honestly, I own three backpacks, and three raincoats, because each of them is the <em>best</em> at some aspect of making me smile. There’s no way to quantify this that I’m aware of, but everyone has a thing, or things that are so neat or personal that every use or interaction with them is a small joy. And we all want to <a href="https://konmari.com/products/spark-joy">spark joy</a>, right? As hokey as I’m sure many of you think Konmari’s Shinto-sequel philosophy of things is, it has certainly helped me in pinpointing why I own them. I pared back my clothing, and donated bags of tech detritus. And yet, I still look for new joys.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a new iOS text editor, or a new pair of lightweight shoes, I browse through my RSS feeds with a delight in seeing fresh things. And fortunately, the delight of looking is relatively free. This daily routine of mine is akin to the window-shopping of old. I’m fascinated by the portrayal of the new things—the praises of their qualities. The search itself makes me happy.</p>
<h2 id="hobby-hunting">Hobby hunting</h2>
<p>I’ve found it’s useful to check in every so often on why I do things. Do my habits make me happy? Do I find joy in studying 漢字 every day? Lifting weights? Lightweight packing? Is my search fo the best things also a way to hunt for new hobbies? The answer, for me, to all of those questions is a yes. And frankly I don’t think there’s anything particularly wrong with this search. I do wish that this curiosity could be de-coupled from capitalism, but the world we live in doesn’t seem to wish for the same thing. I think the best we can do is keep on searching if it makes us happy, and share the things we find and the things we own with each other—sharing the joy as well.</p>
<p>We might all search for our own reasons, but curiosity and interest is a one of the best things of all. When we find satisfaction, the key, I think, is recognizing it, and enjoying it. Until then, happy hunting.</p>

      <description>This was a really great month for books largely because I got really into the Themis Files series. Price’s book on breaking up with your phone also encouraged me to pick up my Kindle more than I refreshed Twitter, and honestly, so far that’s been a positive experience.
Books Noumenon — Marina J. Lostetter
Ah! Another great multi-generational space exploration story. I don&#39;t really get why so many sci-fi books are doing this sort of thing lately, but I&#39;m into it.</description>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>Noumenon</strong> — Marina J. Lostetter</p>
<p>Ah! Another great multi-generational space exploration story. I don't really get why so many sci-fi books are doing this sort of thing lately, but I'm into it. What happens when a ship heads into deep space to explore a distant star? This book. It rules.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Strategy</strong> — Martha Wells</p>
<p>A delightful end to this quadrilogy. I hope we get more Murderbot stories, but even if not, I've thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Protocol</strong> — Martha Wells</p>
<p>I’m really loving this series. Murderbot meets a new pal on this romp on a research station.</p>
<p><strong>Hatching Twitter</strong> — Nick Bilton</p>
<p>This was a tour of betrayal, man-children, and absurd amounts of money. I’d love to see an Armando Ianucci adaptation of this book—especially the incredibly awkward visits with Zuckerberg. Well-written, and easy to read, this kept me very entertained on my flight.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Condition</strong> — Martha wells</p>
<p>It’s really nice to dive back into the series, and the MurderBot continues to be a funny narrator a distant space-bound future. I still think it’s a little odd that these were all published as novellas instead of a full-length, but the episodic quality does give me an easy place to pause and get more to drink. I hope we see more of the new ComfortBot.</p>
<p><strong>Only Human</strong> — Sylvain Neuvel</p>
<p>A solid conclusion to an excellent series. It’s too bad there’s not any more to read, but on the upside, it never dipped into uninteresting territory. The tone of this book is a little post-apocalyptic, and I’m a sucker for that kinda thing.</p>
<p><strong>Waking Gods</strong> — Sylvain Neuvel</p>
<p>This is a series that seems to amp up the excitement with each installation. The first book set the stage, and this is the play. There is quite a bit of action, and a lot of fallout from the first book. A great sequel.</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping Giants</strong> — Sylvain Neuvel</p>
<p>Told through a series of interview transcripts, de-briefings, and diary entries, this rad giant robot story managed to suck me in fast. I burned through this book in a couple of days, and loved every minute. I grew up on Robotech, so some of this plot felt familiar, except without all the singing. If you like giant robots, and somewhat mysterious non-governmental entities, this is a series to check out.</p>
<p><strong>The Traveling Cat Chronicles</strong> — Hiro Arikawa</p>
<p>This book was an emotional rollercoaster. I should’ve be surprised, since it’s about a cat—one of the few things that makes me feel all of the emotions, but wow. This book was very, very good from start to finish. I picked it up on a whim, and it’s perhaps my favorite of the year.</p>
<p><strong>How to Break Up With Your Phone</strong> — Catherine Price</p>
<p>A pretty solid book on establishing more thoughtful ways of dealing with our devices. The advice to think about <em>why</em> you’re reaching for your phone when you do is extremely good, and deceptively simple. I’ve found myself trying to just be in a place without immediately flipping though phone screens to kill time, and <em>maybe</em> it’s helping? I’m going to keep on following the advice of this book for a while, and see how it helps or doesn’t. There’s good advice on email and other types of organization in here as well.</p>
<p><strong>Killing Commentadore</strong> — Haruki Murakami</p>
<p>This novel feels like a return to form, and yet also building on themes and ideas Murakami laid down in earlier books. His obsessions with pits, cats, WW2 history, jazz, and simple lunches are all here. I'm a little tired of the downtrodden male narrator, but despite being first-person, generally our painter guide moved the story along, interspersed with interesting observations. If you enjoy Murakami, there's much joy here. I hope this author is with us for quite some time to come.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Wandering Earth</strong></p>
<p>This is the second-highest grossing film in Chinese cinematic history. I’ve heard about this book for a while, and conceptually it’s interesting to think about the Earth moving instead of colony ships leaving, but it’s frustrating that Chinese censors meant that the themes of the film are somewhat limited. The end result felt more like The Core than Star Wars, and overall it was rather disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>John Wick 3</strong></p>
<p>Ridiculous from start to finish. The fights were fun, the plot moved forward at a fast clip, and this is one of my favorite silly action franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Lego Movie: Part 2</strong></p>
<p>Fun, but didn’t match up to the sheer weird joy of the first movie.</p>
<p><strong>Detective Pikachu</strong></p>
<p>Hilarious and so, so fun. This was definitely a kids movie, but aimed solidly at kids who’re 28-35 now—my generation has the funds to relive our childhoods in cinema. I played a few Pokémon games, and watched the cartoon for a little while in middle school, and seeing all of the Pokémon I know flitting around the screen was a hoot. Ryan Reynolds did some fantastic Pikachu voice acting, matched by the incredible CGI of his fur. One of the sillier, funnier movies I’ve seen in a minute. “My clues!”</p>
<p><strong>Burning</strong></p>
<p>It’s been years since I read the story that this movie was inspired by, so I barely remember it. The pacing of Burning was slow, but each shot was artful, and each scene a strange delight. Also, the ambling, slightly clueless protagonist seemed to fit right in to Murakami world.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic</strong></p>
<p>This was in a really intense movie about how fucking cold it can get in the Arctic, and how scary it is to be crashed there. I like to think that this is somehow an extension of the Hannibal universe, and that in order to escape capture he became a pilot.</p>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>Ghost in the Shell SAC</strong></p>
<p>I finally finished this series! I stole my haircut (sorta) from the protagonist from Ghost in the Shell, but I’d never made it through the early 2000s anime series. It’s very episodic, and uneven, but there are so many highlights and breathtaking scenes. It’s definitely a classic.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong></p>
<p>It’s funny that this show and Patriot exist at the same time, since both tackle duty, and the idea that someone who mostly kills people and carries out clandestine tasks has a fun side. Bill Hader hasn’t ever been a favorite of mine, but I seriously love this goofy show. Everyone, from Henry Winkler, to Stephen Root, to the guy who plays the extremely friendly mafioso is giving their all.</p>

      <description>The latest episode of Supercomputer inspired me to write about how I work with notes, todos, and reminders every day. Part of the episode was centered on their mutual dissatisfaction with various notes apps, which I totally understand. Over the years, I&#39;ve used NVAlt, 1Writer, Bear, Evernote, Notes, and more to keep track of my thoughts, posts, and notes. Brett Terpstra keeps a very good list of all iOS text editors that includes information about their cross-platform functionality.</description>

<p>The <a href="https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/#">latest episode of Supercomputer</a> inspired me to write about how I work with notes, todos, and reminders every day. Part of the episode was centered on their mutual dissatisfaction with various notes apps, which I totally understand. Over the years, I've used <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">NVAlt</a>, 1Writer, Bear, Evernote, Notes, and more to keep track of my thoughts, posts, and notes. Brett Terpstra keeps a <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/"><em>very good list</em></a> of all iOS text editors that includes information about their cross-platform functionality. These days, since I mostly use my iPad and iPhone when I'm not at <a href="https://slack.com/">work</a>, it's vital that my notes and todo apps live happily on Mac, and iOS.</p>
<h2 id="notes-and-posts">Notes and posts</h2>
<p>Ever since I moved most of my personal computer work to an <a href="http://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/11/07/new-ipad-review.html">iPad Pro</a>, I've wanted to make sure my notes and writing were easily accessible from wherever I happened to compute. I also wanted to post that writing to my <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">blog</a> which hilariously I first talked about on my now abandoned <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/why-i-built-a-markdown-book-blog-a07e1a6dd163">Medium</a>. Since I post things via Github pages, which is a near-as-makes-no-difference Jekyll instance, I need the ability to push markdown to Github. With <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy</a>, this is super simple, and if I need to, I can write entire posts in the pretty nice editor that app contains. But, I want more!</p>
<p>To have a great writing experience, with delightful fonts, a pleasing design, and speedy sync, I use <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iAWriter</a>. It's <em>fantastic</em> for notes, long form writing, and even markdown previewing work docs. In the years since the first version of iAWriter launched, it's become an amazing piece of software. I couldn't find the earliest versions, but <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2985482/ia-writer-3-0-1-review-mac-app-gets-back-to-basics-for-focused-writing.html">here's the 2015 version 3</a>. Nowadays, iAWriter can talk to the Files app on iOS natively, which means you can open files from Working Copy, which is registered as a Files location, so you can open files from Github repos in iAWriter. Whether I'm drafting a blog post, or updating my list of <a href="http://www.brookshelley.com/books">books</a> that I've read, I open iAWriter first, after pulling the latest version of my repo in Working Copy. For writing and notes I don't plan to store in my repo, iAWriter keeps them on iCloud as <code>.md</code> files so I don't have to worry about portability or missing files. Because these files live in iCloud, they're searchable using Spotlight on both my iOS and Mac devices—no more depending on launching an app to search. It's wild how good this app combination is, and how fast I'm able to find and edit things using iAWriter's native Apple integrations.</p>
<p>When I'm at meetings at work, I also tend to take notes with a <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-safari/">pen</a> and a <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2019/all_about/weeks/">notebook</a> because it <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away">helps retention</a> and looks quite a bit less rude to my coworkers or partners. If something needs to be shared, I type it up in Slack or put it in a Readme on a repo.</p>
<p>But what about my todos?!</p>
<h2 id="todos">Todos</h2>
<p>I work at a company in San Francisco who's goal is to &ldquo;make work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive.&rdquo; I think we're good at it, but I've found that I need a separate place to keep track of my work tasks, my life tasks, and all the random junk I need quick access to when I'm going through my week. <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> is that app for me. I made a Project for everything I work on, and Areas for things like &ldquo;stuff to buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;stuff to watch&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/projects.png" alt="projects"></p>
<p>My main view is Today, where tasks I need to finish by bedtime live. When the workday ends, anything I haven't accomplished gets moved to tomorrow—this is a conscious choice over having those tasks follow me home. That means that I don't have the psychic dread of &ldquo;more work&rdquo;, but can still look at Things for things like the code to my therapist's office, or a reminder to scoop the cat litter. I love it. Things is the perfect example of just heavy enough feature-wise to handle power-users while only exposing simple features for everyone else. The search is amazing, especially on Mac, where all you need to do is <em>start typing</em>. Sure, there's no location-based reminders, but honestly at a certain point, <em>in my opinion</em> you're just faffing around and avoiding work by adding so many layers to your todo process. Get shit done instead of doing loads of metalwork.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-track-of-all-of-the-things">Keeping track of all of the things</h2>
<p>For me, writing and notes goes in iAWriter, and anything I need to <em>do</em> goes into Things. Sometimes my tasks include a link to a relevant Slack conversation, or email in Spark, or website—and other times it's just a note to take some medicine or drop mail off in the mailbox. My projects groupings mean I know historically what I've accomplished in various areas or work things, and I don't stress too much planning months in the future. Planning, at least at work, is often a team effort, and there's a calendar or a roadmap that I don't need to duplicate in Things. I note what my responsibilities are, and set due dates or targets for those, and leave the rest to where my work actually lives—Slack. If you want to dive more into GTD or w/e, I recommend <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190401160435/http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">43 Folders</a>, which is possibly now disavowed by Merlin, but is still a very smart look at productivity. Generally, simple systems work well for me, and if I look at something, I should either store it, trash it, or use it.</p>
<p>My systems are super helpful for <em>me</em>, but might not work, or work differently for you. That's totally ok! Hopefully something here was helpful or interesting, and if not, feel free to browse away, and forget~ Work will always be here for you, like a strange nightmare, and how you choose to tackle it is a personal decision.</p>

      <description>Books The United States of Japan — Peter Tieryas
An alternate history where Japan and Germany won WW2, then proceeded to divvy up North America. Most of the book is set in the 80s, in a world of internet devices, and giant robots, ruled by the Japanese emperor. It&#39;s a brutal story at times, but was generally interesting and a good sci-fi time.

<p><strong>The United States of Japan</strong> — Peter Tieryas</p>
<p>An alternate history where Japan and Germany won WW2, then proceeded to divvy up North America. Most of the book is set in the 80s, in a world of internet devices, and giant robots, ruled by the Japanese emperor. It's a brutal story at times, but was generally interesting and a good sci-fi time.</p>
<p><strong>If Cats Disappeared from the World</strong> — Genki Kawarmura <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>I love a good devil’s bargain, and this book is full of them. This was a cute, sweet story about the real things we should value in life, and what we’re willing to sacrifice for life. The small details and strange obsessions reminded me a lot of Haruki Murakami’s style.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Avengers:Endgame</strong></p>
<p>This was like three movies jammed into one. It was fine, but I hope they stop doing the massive super hero stuff for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Hagazussa</strong></p>
<p>Bizarre and utterly obsessed with liquids. Hard to watch, but also beautiful at times.</p>
<p><strong>Still Walking</strong></p>
<p>A delightful meditation on family. I watched an earlier Koreeda movie called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Knows_(2004_film)">Nobody Knows</a> just after college, and it destroyed me. I mostly forgot about this director until Shoplifters last year, and damn, I loved that film too. I think i only have the emotional wherewithal to watch something he made every few months, but each time I dive into his world, there’s an incredible depth to how he shows the small ways we love and lose each other. Also it’s wild to see You-san in an acting role, and not on the Terrace House couch.</p>
<p><strong>Little</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know where to start with this weird mess of a movie. It was super funny at times, but left a lot on the cutting floor, had an utterly bizarre trans “joke”, and the worst driving scenes I’ve seen. At the same time, it was goofy, cute, and a man behind us loudly said, “that’s her when she was little”.</p>
<p><strong>Glass</strong></p>
<p>Well, I’ve finished Shyamalan’s weird comic trilogy. I remember watching Unbreakable in the theater at the mall near my house as a kid. I’d don’t know if that mall even exists anymore, but for a while, you could go to the arcade downstairs, and then watch a movie in the theater near the food court. I was straight-up enamored with Shyamalan at the time. Sixth Sense was fresh on my mind, and Unbreakable was bizarre, but hinted at something wild. Subsequent movies took this M. Night from a must watch icon, to an amusing auteur, and I think that’s great. The Happening is a movie I deeply love, but this trilogy never really lived up to either the mystery or weirdness of his best work. I think in an effort to make a meta-comic movie, he made something that ultimately doesn’t deliver much past a so-so premise that heroes <em>do</em> exist. Which, is fine, but isn’t “he was dead the whole time,” or “the plants!”</p>
<p><strong>The Night is Short, Walk on Girl</strong></p>
<p>This movie is gorgeous, which is to be expected from one of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ART-BOOK-NOW-Yusuke-Nakamura/dp/4864103844">Yusuke Nakamura’s</a> works. The plot is pretty bonkers, and includes everything from strange gods, rare alcohols, and a collection of Classical Japanese porn. If you like this, you might also love <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy">Tatami Galaxy</a> from the same folks. There’s a certain spiritual similarity to Tampopo in this film’s over-the-top appreciation for food and drinks too.</p>
<p><strong>Tampopo</strong></p>
<p>This was a really fun movie about how amazing food can be. Tons of literal and figurative porn scenes about noodles, eggs, and more. The western film style is kinda wacky and silly, but the overall tone was interesting. I was a bit out of it when I watched this film, so I missed some of it, but likely this'll be a rewatch.</p>
<p><strong>Us</strong></p>
<p>Super spooky. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the combination of very good dad jokes, incredibly talented actors, and tight pacing kept this film feeling scary and fun throughout. There’s twists and turns, and a very good boat name or two. See this movie. I’m stoked we get to see more of Peele’s work in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Prospect</strong></p>
<p>What a cool movie. This tense space flick proved that you can do a lot of sci-fi stuff with less budget. I love media about shitty tech, and this is kind of “what happens when you’re a skint space prospector” angle down pat. This could’ve been a weird Cowboy Bebop live action, but instead tackled the idea from a different angle. Sophie Thatcher rules, too. Wherever this was shot, it was gorgeous.</p>
<h2 id="notable-tv">Notable TV</h2>
<p><strong>Fleabag</strong></p>
<p>Season 2 of this amazing show just built on the hilarity and sadness of the first. Waller-Bridges is brilliant, and it’s amazing we get both this show and Killing Eve. Fleabag is a meditation on family, loss, and love. It’s also one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>Homecoming</strong></p>
<p>The end scenes of every episode give off a really Lynchian vibe. I never listened to this podcast, so I had no idea where the show was going. Julia Roberts is great, and Bobby Canavalle is a delightful villain. The filming was quite nice, with consistently interesting framing.</p>
<p><strong>Hanna</strong></p>
<p>I loved this movie when it came out years ago, with Saiorse Ronan and a Chemical Brothers soundtrack, and this new adaptation was even better. The score was haunting, and the pacing and characters stayed interesting. I’m not sure if there’s anything left for a second season, but I’d love to see more rad, competent Hanna scenes.</p>

      <description>When I mention my love of Formula 1 racing, most of the time I hear, &amp;ldquo;is that like NASCAR?&amp;rdquo; This speaks to the sad lack of F1 information and excitement in the states, and it&#39;s a bummer. NASCAR is a sport in its own right, but comparing it to F1 is a bit like comparing rotary phones to an iPhone. F1 is fast, the roads twist this way and that, and most importantly the drivers are from across the globe.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>When I mention my love of Formula 1 racing, most of the time I hear, &ldquo;is that like NASCAR?&rdquo; This speaks to the sad lack of F1 information and excitement in the states, and it's a bummer. NASCAR is a sport in its own right, but comparing it to F1 is a bit like comparing rotary phones to an iPhone. F1 is fast, the roads twist this way and that, and most importantly the drivers are from across the globe. Drama between these drivers, these princes of speed, is often even more entertaining than the drama on the track. With the launch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1:_Drive_to_Survive">Netflix's F1 documentary</a> that covers the events of the 2018 season, my hope is more folks in the states will get excited about the best racing series in the world.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-racing">My history with racing</h2>
<p>When I was a kid, my uncle was involved in car racing as a pit crew member, and occasional pit chief. He'd gotten his start racing motorcycles in the 70s and early 80s, and by the time he'd moved away, I'd been to a number of CART and Grand Prix races around Dallas. My whole family loved cars. I grew up around Mustangs being worked-on, oil changes, and DIY repairs. I rode a small motorcycle as a kid I inherited from that same uncle who raced and wrenched on cars, and fell deeply in love with speed.</p>
<p>We watched a few racing series when I was younger, but my attention span meant nothing really stuck. Years later, that changed.</p>
<h2 id="watching-weekly">Watching weekly</h2>
<p>After college, I settled into a tech career and had relatively low-key weekends full of TV and reading. The exact impetus escapes me (it was probably Top Gear related), but at one point, I found a way to stream F1 races every week. My new routine was watching the qualification rounds on Saturday, and then watching an F1 race the next day. I was quickly sucked into the dramatic rise of Sebastian Vettel, who seemed to be incapable of failure as he racked-up victories in the Red Bull F1 car. I loved watching Jenson Button, who seemed like a charming enough fellow, and Kimi Raikonnenn, who's dry wit, and sour temperament was weirdly hilarious.</p>
<p>The modern era of F1 is largely ruled by three teams:</p>
<pre><code>- [Mercedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One): Hamilton &amp; Bottas (Formerly Rosberg)
- [Red Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing): Verstapen &amp; Gasly (Formerly both Ricciardo &amp; Vettel)
- [Ferrari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari#Domination_in_the_early_2000s): Vettel &amp; LeClerc (Formerly Schumacher &amp; Raikonnen)
</code></pre>
<p>These teams have huge budgets, some of the best drivers, and a cutthroat ability to rule the front positions of almost every race. It's a little frustrating that for the most part, other teams don't win unless there's a big wreck or engine failure, but at least at times the competition between these three is heated.</p>
<p>If you've watched the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1:_Drive_to_Survive">Netflix documentary</a>, you won't have seen too much about these top teams, as Mercedes and Ferrari declined to participate. But, what you did see was the exciting race to be best-of-the-rest, and a very optimistic goal for Renault or HAAS to become the 3rd or 4th place team one day. Rules changes may eventually help even the field, but until then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HurubWM67MM">even back markers can cause a ruckus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hope-for-the-future">Hope for the future</h2>
<p>With a launch of a <a href="https://wseries.com">women's race series</a> that has the stated goal of &ldquo;[giving] remarkable female drivers an opportunity in motorsport that simply hasn’t been available to them before now&rdquo;, I seriously hope one day we'll have a female F1 driver. It's fun enough to watch 20 guys race, but watching a few women shake things up would be incredible. I want young girls to dream of racing at 300km/h and have it be a real possibility. The <a href="https://wseries.com/races/hockenheim/">first race</a> of this rad new series is May 4th, and I can't wait to watch.</p>
<p>In a different direction, there's an all electric racing series called <a href="https://www.fiaformulae.com/en/championship/teams-and-drivers">Formula E</a>. Due to battery constraints, and I think to make for an exciting race, teams change cars mid-race, and there's odd bonuses to speed that fans can vote on. I've watched a few of these races, and while I'm glad to see a more eco-friendly race start to gain steam, it definitely feels like the neglected little brother of F1 at this point. Perhaps in the future, this race will have its own cache.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

      <description>Ten or so years ago, I realized I hated bringing heavy bags with me everywhere I traveled, so I slimmed down my packing to fit in one small backpack. My wardrobe generally cycles between a few pieces, so it wasn’t much of a stretch to adapt it to a month in Japan or Berlin. I usually write a post-trip gear update, but today is all about clothing.
What’re you wearing? Whether it’s a one week or one month-long trip, I bring the same things each time Including what I’m wearing during the flight, here’s the breakdown:</description>

My wardrobe generally cycles between a few pieces, so it wasn’t much of a stretch to adapt it to a month in <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2019/03/13/travel-kit-update.html">Japan</a> or Berlin. I usually write a post-trip gear update, but today is all about clothing.</p>
<h2 id="whatre-you-wearing">What’re you wearing?</h2>
<p>Whether it’s a one week or one month-long trip, I bring the same things each time Including what I’m wearing during the flight, here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 pairs of <a href="#underwear">underwear</a></li>
<li>2 <a href="#shirts">shirts</a></li>
<li>2 sports <a href="#underwear">bras</a></li>
<li>2 pairs of wool <a href="#shoes">socks</a></li>
<li>1 water-resistant <a href="#jacket">hoodie</a></li>
<li>(weather-optional) 1 <a href="#jacket">jacket</a></li>
<li>1 pair of <a href="#shoes">shoes</a></li>
<li>1 pair of <a href="#pants">pants</a></li>
<li>1 pair of shorts or <a href="#pants">leggings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>None of the stuff I wear is particularly cheap, or particularly expensive, but on the whole, it’s held up well to lots of abuse, and many washes. The key to bringing very little clothing is a willingness to wash your clothes in the sink or shower while you bathe. If you find a washing machine, by all means, take advantage of it, but these clothes dry pretty quickly, and I prefer not to hope for something automated. If something gets destroyed (only happened once with some jeans), I can usually find a replacement, but taking stock before a trip of any of your clothing that’s in danger of ripping is a great plan.</p>
<h2 id="tops-a-nameshirtsa">Tops <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Day or night, the tops I wear look pretty good, wick sweat ok, and tend to hold up to a day of hiking. I spent a while only wearing wool, but recently got stoked on a few other shirts. Sadly, Ryu doesn’t make the wool shirt I wear anymore, but there are a bunch of brands making wool shirts these days, so have a look around if that appeals to you.</p>
<p>Usually, if it’s hot or I plan to layer, I wear a <a href="https://ryu.com/shop/us/women/tops/standard-issue-racerback-tank">tank top</a>. No sleeves means no pit stains, and with a hoodie you’re pretty set regardless of the modesty required in a temple or other spot. I’ve had good luck with Ryu and Lucy (though they’ve been bought by North Face, and I don’t know how good they are anymore). Arcteryx used to make a cool wool tank, but they make <a href="https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/a2b-scoop-neck-shirt-ss">this</a> now, and if it’s the same fabric, it’s great!</p>
<p>A friend convinced me to try out these <a href="https://jungmaven.com/collections/hemp-core-tees-tshirt-womens/products/hemp-shirt-ojai-tee-short-sleeve-womens?variant=22065464279088">hemp shirts</a>, and for the first time in years, I wear a few colors. They’re super light, super soft, and don’t get stinky after a few wears.</p>
<p>I wear one of these shirts while I’m sleeping, and one during the day, and kinda rotate them around. If I’m gone for longer I might bring 2 shirts and a tank top, so I don’t have to wash as much.</p>
<h2 id="bottoms-a-namepantsa">Bottoms <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Most of the time I wear <a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/rectrek-pant?variant=34894684485">Outdoor Voices RecTrek pants</a>, which are comfy, stretchy, and cute. They run out of sizes all the time or I’d have a couple pairs. They dress up for the office ok, but also handle a <em>lot</em> of walking. Since I can’t find another black XL pair, I am currently trying out <a href="https://coalatree.com/collections/apparel/products/slim-fit-trailhead-pants-black">another brand</a>. These Coalatree pants are also pretty great, though the tie at the bottom of each leg is kinda ridiculous. They’re unisex, which means the fit might be weird, but they’ve also got a <em>ergonomic crotch gusset</em> a la <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/chuck-norris-action-jeans/">Chuck Norris action jeans</a>. I don’t know <em>why</em> you’d do tons of high kicks in pants, but either of these pairs would handle them with gusto.</p>
<p>You probably already have your preferred brand of legging, but for me, I’m usually wearing either <a href="https://ryu.com/shop/us/women/bottoms/cardio-tights">Ryu</a> or <a href="https://www.girlfriend.com/collections/leggings/products/black-compressive-high-rise-legging">Girlfriend</a>. I’ve heard great things about Outdoor Voices leggings, but I’m waiting until I destroy a few more old pairs before I try them. For night time, leggings or <a href="https://www.foxers.com/black-tomboy-boxer-brief/">Foxers</a> are great for wandering around my Airbnb or hotel room.</p>
<h2 id="underwear-a-nameunderweara">Underwear <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Breathable, light, comfortable, and durable is the name of the game for underwear. I’m always on the search for a pair that hits all four targets. Thus far, some have done ok, but most aren’t that durable. A better pair I tried were <a href="https://knix.com/collections/underwear/products/athletic-bikini">Knix</a>, which were super comfy, but eventually blew up. Sometimes I bring <a href="https://www.meundies.com/products/womens-bikini">MeUndies</a>, but they too tend to fall apart too soon. These wool <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-active-briefs-underwear/32396.html?dwvar_32396_color=BLK&amp;cgid=socks-underwear#tile-7=&amp;start=1&amp;sz=24">Patagonia briefs</a> were alright. I feel like I’ll be on the hunt indefinitely, but maybe a few pairs of one of these will do if for you. All three are comfortable, and dry fast, but the Knix and Patagonia pairs are better for sweaty hikes as the MeUndies tend to get a little swamped.</p>
<p>Three pairs of underwear might seem like too few, and feel free to adjust as necessary, but by and large: one to wear, one to wash, one that’s dry. This motto means you’re almost always set for two days, and worst case, you can dry a pair on the outside of your bag while hiking. The Knix and Patagonia briefs dry in only a few hours, so you could wash before breakfast, and come back, coffee in hand to some clean drawers.</p>
<p>For bras, I stick to sports bras from Pact or Calvin Klein. I hate underwrites, and sports bras last a lot longer between washes.</p>
<h2 id="jacket-a-namejacketa">Jacket <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Your mileage may vary heavily on style and need for this category, but my go-tos always include the <a href="https://missionworkshop.com/products/the-torre-womens-high-performance-windpro-hoodie-jacket">Torre Wind Pro</a>. I recently bought a second one of these, and even though I think Mission Workshop is getting rid of their women’s line (boo hiss), this is an incredible hoodie. It is DWR coated so light rain just falls off, and also fleece-lined so by itself I can handle temperatures down to 8c/46f. Colder or wetter, and I bring an overcoat. The two coats in my rotation right now are the <a href="https://www.arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/codetta-coat">Arcteryx Codetta</a> and the <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/jk-18au004-fr-rain-trench?variant=13074792972386">Snow Peak FR Rain Trench</a> (which is also <em>fireproof</em>?!). Good layering means even at freezing temperatures, I do well. If it was super cold, I’d probably include a wool sweater to wear under or over my hoodie, and I’d throw my leggings on under my pants.</p>
<h2 id="shoes-and-socks-a-nameshoesa">Shoes and socks <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><a href="https://bombas.com/products/women-s-solid-invisibles-tan-small?variant=black">Bombas</a> or Darn Tough are the way to go for socks. Most of the time it’s not cold enough to wear longer socks, so I wear no-shows or ankle socks. Wool means these also wick well, and wash easily—depending on your food funk, a couple days is usually fine between washes.</p>
<p>If it’s cold or wet, I’m wearing <a href="https://www.blundstone.com/shop/black-premium-leather-chelsea-boots-womens-style-558">Blundstones</a>, or <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/M20327.html">Stan Smiths</a>. Summer means something light and knit like <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-sock-primeknit-shoes/CQ2218.html">these Sambas</a>. Lightweight, comfortable, and breathable means you only need one pair of shoes. If they’re black, even sneakers work in many slightly fancy situations. In my opinion, sandals should only show up in a public shower, or on the beach, so I never bring any.</p>
<h2 id="hat">Hat</h2>
<p>A wool beanie is great for warmth, so I wear <a href="https://www.tannergoods.com/products/merino-watch-cap">this one from Tanner Goods</a>. It’s expensive, but it holds up.</p>
<h2 id="plan-ahead">Plan ahead</h2>
<p>All of my clothing works well for me, but I typically go to Europe or Japan. If you go somewhere much hotter or much colder, you’ll definitely need to adjust, especially if you go from a freezing spot to a hot one. If you end up bringing a lot of stuff for one leg of a trip, you can always mail stuff home too. Layering is your friend. There’re a lot of <a href="https://www.carryology.com/travel/how-what-to-put-in-your-minimalist-travel-capsule-wardrobe/">lists for women</a> that have much more feminine clothing, but that’s not really my jam. For me, functional &gt; cute any day of the week. But, regardless of your style choice, stretchy, lightweight clothing is the way to go.</p>

      <description>Books The City in the Middle of the Night — Charlie Jane Anders
A fantastic book about humankind settling on a tidally-locked planet, but instead of seeing how we cope, we learn the stories of their descendants, hundreds of years after our first tentative steps. The light is too bright and hot, and the night too cold and dark. We live on the edge in an eternal dusk/morning light. The two protagonists, Mouth, and Sophie, are on the edges of society, yearning for things they&#39;ve lost or can&#39;t have, and all that leads towards.</description>

<p><strong>The City in the Middle of the Night</strong> — Charlie Jane Anders</p>
<p>A fantastic book about humankind settling on a tidally-locked planet, but instead of seeing how we cope, we learn the stories of their descendants, hundreds of years after our first tentative steps. The light is too bright and hot, and the night too cold and dark. We live on the edge in an eternal dusk/morning light. The two protagonists, Mouth, and Sophie, are on the edges of society, yearning for things they've lost or can't have, and all that leads towards. This book was a beautiful meditation on love and community, as well as memory. If you've read the Steerswoman series, you might find some familiarity, but generally the genre of lost technology and future worlds is incredibly fascinating to me.</p>
<p><strong>Vengeful</strong> — VE Schwab</p>
<p>An interesting sequel to Vicious, the first of the Villains series. Most of the book serves as a prologue for the lighting-fast action at the end of the book, and I’m very excited to see what these characters do next, if she continues for a third installment. I really enjoyed the character June, because who doesn’t love a shapeshifting assassin?</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Captain Marvel</strong></p>
<p>Super fun! Brie Larson made for a very compelling super hero, and I love Goose with my whole heart. The 90s throwback setting was a delight, along with its soundtrack. I’m stoked to see what this sets up for future Marvel films, and hopeful that we see the Skrull again (please show up in Runaways).</p>
<p><strong>Flavors of Youth</strong></p>
<p>An alright film about the things we leave behind as we grow older, and the tastes and regrets we have. Most of this film is set in China, which is an interesting place to hear all the characters speak Japanese. There are three vignettes, and none really tugged my heartstrings, but it was still a well done movie.</p>
<h2 id="noteable-tv">Noteable TV</h2>
<p><strong>F1: Drive to Survive</strong></p>
<p>I've followed F1 racing for years, and love the drama and speed. This series shows the myriad stories and personalities that make these ten teams and twenty drivers so cool. Even if you've never watched a single race, you might be drawn in by this series. I'd forgotten how wild the 2018 season is, and 2019 has only just begun. 19 more races this year to see if someone can finally edge out Ferrari or Mercedes</p>
<p><strong>Pen15</strong></p>
<p>This is an incredible show about middle school, embarrassment, and friendship. It covers so much ground and captures the 90s perfectly. The main actresses (in their 30s) seem to have a blast in every scene, and I bet filming with actual children was a trip. My favorite line was “I found that dress in a river”.</p>

      <description>Since 2019, I updated my kit a little bit, but mostly it stayed the same.
One old bag, one new My Ryu Quickpack was a delight once-again, as I used it to transport all my gear to Japan, and then from city to city. Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I&#39;ve owned, but due to its size, I don&#39;t like hauling it around all day.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Since 2019, I updated my kit a <a href="https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1100823338497105921">little bit</a>, but mostly it stayed the same.</p>
<h2 id="one-old-bag-one-new">One old bag, one new</h2>
<p>My Ryu Quickpack was a delight once-again, as I used it to transport all my gear to Japan, and then from city to city. Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I've owned, but due to its size, I don't like hauling it around all day. I hoped that the DSPTCH bag would work really well during day to day travel, and it probably would have if it hadn't rained every day. The waist bag isn't waterproof (boo), or particularly comfortable for long stretches (double boo), due to the one shoulder setup. I wear the Waist Bag to work almost every day, but for way less time, so I'd forgotten how little continual stress my left shoulder can take. Also, I learned that with <a href="https://www.arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/codetta-coat">my rain coat</a> on, the bag slides up uncomfortably against my neck, so next time I'll need a day backpack again. Most days, I chose not to bring a bag to avoid this discomfort. I hauled my LAMY Safari pen + a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Hobonichi-Techo-Weeks/ct/4399">Hobonichi Weeks</a>, my phone, and some tissue paper, so a bag was overkill mostly.</p>
<h2 id="two-jackets">Two jackets</h2>
<p>I took my Arcteryx coat to Japan, and it served me well, despite being a <em>little</em> tight. However, I wandered into a Snow Peak store early in the trip, and my friend Sarah and the shopkeeper convinced me to try on a steeply discounted <a href="https://snowpeak.com/collections/outerwear-1/products/jk-18au004-fr-rain-trench?variant=13074792972386">Japanese XL <em>fire resistant</em> jacket</a>. It fit like a charm, and was long enough to easily cover my knees so I could stay warm and dry in the constant rain. I alternated between the two coats through the rest of the wet trip, but with both in my RYU bag, there wasn't much room for other stuff. I never plan on buying much in Japan, and certainly not clothes, so this was a pleasant surprise. As a back-up, I had a packable Baggu tote, but I never had to resort to carrying stuff in the tote on the way home. If I were traveling to a rainy area again, I'd only bring one coat, and which one would depend on how much layering I needed to do. It's kinda nice to have options.</p>
<h2 id="just-enough-space">Just enough space</h2>
<p>By the end of my trip the RYU bag was a <em>tight</em> zip. I bought two manga tankoban, and one Japanese novel, as well as a series of gachapon souvenirs, <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2015/05/japanese-lucky-charms-the-guide-to-omamori/">omamori</a>, and a load of Vick's lozenges because of my cold. Everything fit, along with my two jackets, but only <em>just</em> so. I wore my DSPTCH bag on the front, outside of the RYU to get on the plane or train, but I could stuff it in if I needed to.</p>
<h2 id="planned-changes">Planned changes</h2>
<p>Next trip, if the weather is similar, my plan is to bring one jacket, and not buy another. Additionally, two pairs of pants was really beneficial, but <a href="http://www.coalatree.com/collections/kachula/products/trailhead-adventure-pant">a new pair I bought</a> should pack better than <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nike-nikelab-x-mmw-womens-pants/4796841">the Nike pants</a> I brought, so that will save some space. My <a href="http://www.goby.co/products/electric-toothbrush-all-black">new toothbrush</a> worked swimmingly, and I didn't bring a charger, since my trip was ~2 weeks. I brought just enough toiletries, and that felt nice. I wish I'd brought a tank top to sleep in, as I only had two shirts, so I felt like one was always a little funky from sleep, but because they wick, it was alright. For a daypack, I might look for an ultralight packable daypack, like one from Matador or <a href="http://www.ynotmade.com/en/shop/splitshift/?sku=5808">YNOT</a>, but my Topo Designs bag is probably good enough.</p>
<h2 id="next-trip">Next trip</h2>
<p>Next time I fly, it’s a short trip to Portland for a conference I’m doing a talk at with some friends. Two days means I’ll bring my Oppose This bag, and have a chill, easy time. Hopefully I’ll get to go back to Japan later this year and test this whole load-out again.</p>

      <description>Books Genocidal Organ — Project Itoh
A truly grim thriller about the cost of “fighting terrorism,” and the ability of language to tear apart a country. This feels eerily prescient. I can’t say I enjoyed reading this book, but it’s a nihilistic political commentary that at least adds some color to what politicians might be after when they start wars and conflicts. This book is graphic, violent, and in its way, poignant.</description>

<p><strong>Genocidal Organ</strong> — Project Itoh</p>
<p>A truly grim thriller about the cost of “fighting terrorism,” and the ability of language to tear apart a country. This feels eerily prescient. I can’t say I <em>enjoyed</em> reading this book, but it’s a nihilistic political commentary that at least adds some color to what politicians might be after when they start wars and conflicts. This book is graphic, violent, and in its way, poignant.</p>
<p><strong>Amberlough</strong> — Lara Elena Donnelly <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>In some ways this reminded me of the show Babylon Berlin—it feels like an alternate reality 20s Germany, replete with spies, dancers, pasties, and patsies. I think it's building up to a longer series, and so much of the plot slowly churned towards an ellipsis of an ending. I liked it, but I'm not rushing to read the next one. None of the characters necessarily captured my interest, but it was nice that the protagonists were largely gay. This book answers the question, what if folks wrote new stories with their own characters instead of fanfic.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaiming Your Life from IBS</strong> — Melissa Hunt</p>
<p>My doctor recommended this, and it's largely CBT 101 + some good notes on food and stress. I don't know if it'll be super useful, but we'll see! I don't even know if this is a problem I face, but the doctor said &ldquo;probably&rdquo;, so lol.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Anna and the Apocalypse</strong></p>
<p>A high-school musical with zombies. I really don’t like musicals, to be honest. I’d heard good things about this one though, and wanted to give it a chance. The cast is doing a pretty good job throughout, though the relatively one-dimensional characters of the “hot jock” and the “asshole headmaster” are schlocky. This movie mostly made me want to watch Sean of the Dead again, which used rock music to better effect.</p>
<p><strong>Polar</strong></p>
<p>Mads Mikkelsen got his Takeshi Kitano take-no-prisoners action role. This movie was adapted from a comic, and it feels just like a comic, down to the choppy dialogue, fast-paced action, and dead-simple plot. It’s kinda fun, if you can get over the copious amounts of cartoonish murder.</p>
<p><strong>Piercing</strong></p>
<p>Weird. I read this book probably 10 years ago, and enjoyed it. The movie is a lighter adaptation, as it’s trickier to capture internal dialogue on film. Mia Wasikowska is outstanding as usual. I also enjoyed the general 70s aesthetic, and the cool selection of lingerie. This film only clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes, but manages to build and release tension a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Spy</strong></p>
<p>I don't know why I slept on this film. I guess I like Paul Fieg movies? This is delightful fare from Melissa Mcarthy, and a solid supporting cast.</p>
<h2 id="notable-tv">Notable TV</h2>
<p><strong>True Detective Season 3</strong></p>
<p>There were plenty of twists, and turns, and emotional volleys in this show. Mahershala Ali and Carmen Ejogo were electric, and despite it not being about anything magic (a girl can dream of ghosts and monsters), it was still gorgeous, sad, and <em>true</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Russian Doll</strong></p>
<p>A Groundhog Day about depression, drugs, sex, and probably psychodynamics. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>Travellers</strong></p>
<p>I’m sad this got cancelled for season 4, but it’s probably still worth watching for the 3 seasons we got. Time Travelers take over the bodies of folks in present day to prevent an apocalyptic event. Fun sci-fi.</p>
<p><strong>Sex Education</strong></p>
<p>Gillian Anderson &amp; youthful hilarity. Lots of new actors and actresses in this one that I hope we’ll see again soon.</p>
<p><strong>Magicians Season 4</strong></p>
<p>This went from being a very good version of a solid book series, to so much more. Excellent acting. This show balances serious with silly incredibly well.</p>

While Twitter and other networks flounder, open standards provide a simple way to read. RSS means no trolls and no reply gifs. It’s you, and the content.</p>
<h2 id="my-rss-history">My RSS history</h2>
<p>As a long time nerd and tech news reader, I’ve used RSS steadily since the early 2000s, when MacOS RSS programs like <a href="https://nnw.ranchero.com">NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss">Vienna</a> were fresh. I used RSS on Nokia phones, but the iPhone was revelatory. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/14/reeder-for-mac/">Version 2.0 of Reeder</a> ensured a unified experience of RSS on my iPhone, my iPad, and my Mac—at the time I predominantly used a MacBook Air and an iPhone 4—which meant that by popping in the URLs of various sites, I could stay up to date at my desk or on the go. I continued to use Reeder until recently, when in preparation for Reeder 4.0 the app’s creator made it free, but stopped regular updates. Throughout this time, my RSS feed list changed, but usually had <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, whatever <a href="https://desert.glass">Robin Sloan was working on</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com">tech news</a>, <a href="https://www.waxy.org">creative</a> <a href="https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/566524.html">friends</a>, and writing on productivity and <a href="https://www.carryology.com">bags</a>. Some sites <a href="https://Kottke.org">stayed around</a>, and some died down, <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org">only to return</a>. It’s always been relaxing to know that my news feed would appear every morning, and update throughout the day, which no social buttons or comments. This was the modern newspaper we were promised. It worked in many apps, tons of them were free, and you could save them until you were ready. Folks have worried about information <a href="https://www.wired.com/2003/08/aggregators-attack-info-overload/">overload since the beginning</a> of RSS, and really, since <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload">the early 1900s</a>, but I find RSS to be a simple way to store, view, and save stories.</p>
<h2 id="rss-today">RSS today</h2>
<p>Almost 20 years into using RSS, I’ve settled into <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> for the backend (and yes, I pay for it), with its excellent web client on my work MacBook Pro. It’s lovingly developed, and has a <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/09/11/private-by-default/">strong stance on user privacy</a> which I feel like folks rarely do these days. On my iPad and iPhone, I’ve enjoyed <a href="http://cocoacake.net/apps/fiery/">Fiery Feeds</a>, which is independently developed, and even has a <a href="http://blog.cocoacake.net/archives/1205">public feature roadmap</a>. Both of these readers have good dark mode support, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to sync across platforms.</p>
<p>I subscribe to newsletters with <a href="https://www.kill-the-newsletter.com">Kill the Newsletter</a>, which lets me see emails as RSS feeds, and gives me less reason to feel beholden to my Inbox. It’s nice. <a href="https://www.shatnerchatner.com">Lots</a> of <a href="https://tinyletter.com/5it">folks</a> have <a href="https://dillandfennel.substack.com">newsletters</a> these days. It’s easy to subscribe and unsubscribe, and it’s even possible to make a decent living <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/">writing emails to hundreds of people</a>. Knowing that on Sundays I’ll have a few new missives in my inbox or RSS feed makes me happy. These writers aren’t hoping for more clicks for a truck or razor brand; posts are either free, or supported through a simple monthly donation. Single authors don’t need hypergrowth, just some loyal readers with a few hundred at $5 a month leading to a decent annual salary. This could be naive, but it feels like most of these Newsletter writers do halfway out of a compulsion to share, and halfway out of the joy of writing.</p>
<p>Usually when I’m interested in reading something, but don’t have time, I save it to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294">Safari’s Reading List</a>, which not only saves the site’s URL for later, but saves the page offline, so you can catch up on reading while under the water, or in the air commuting. In the past I liked Instapaper, but found that having a bespoke read-it-later app meant I was too likely to collect old articles that I rarely read. Using Safari means all my saved posts are just a shortcut away when I have Safari open. Sometimes I star something instead—mostly because Feedbin’s site doesn’t have a good Safari Reading List shortcut. Either way, once my feed is marked as read, at some point that day I’ll read the stories and articles I saved.</p>
<p>In the morning, while I’m getting ready, I usually listen to a podcast or music, and scan through my RSS feed. Even on a heavy news day, I have under 80 articles listed around 8am, and most of them get scrolled-by with nary a glance. This means I can parse what’s happening very quickly while I <a href="https://crema.co/guides/hario-v60-pour-over">pour hot water on bean crumbs</a> and head to the bus stop. Much like reading email, I try to only visit my RSS reader a few times a day, but unlike a social media site, there aren’t features designed to entice me to tap the “more” button like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_stimulation_reward">a rat in a cage</a>. It’s pleasant. It’s slow. It has the people and things I choose in it.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-social-reading">The future of social reading</h2>
<p>I still use Twitter, but find myself typically talking about and sharing stories and interesting things in private Slack instances with people I care about or work with. This means I get to have a pleasant chat about a <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/books">new book</a> without seeing twenty posts about the world ending. I still see news, but with much less repetition and FUD. If a feed doesn’t <em>spark joy</em>, I let it go. SMTP and RSS may be old, but theirs’ is a lasting peace, and I hope if you haven’t delved into them recently, you revisit these tools. This year I am trying to slow down, take joy in rest, and find kindness for myself. I want a better world, and to fight for it, I need time away from the firehose. In RSS, I’ve found a serene pond.</p>

      <description>My first Japanese class In 1996 I took my first Japanese class at Austin Community College. I was in middle school at the time, and decided to learn how to read Japanese so I could read literature and comics. The class was fun, and also super weird, since I was the only kid there. I took two semesters, but a lot of life happened at once, so I stopped taking Japanese, and didn’t being again until University, five years later.</description>

<h2 id="my-first-japanese-class">My first Japanese class</h2>
<p>In 1996 I took my first Japanese class at Austin Community College. I was in middle school at the time, and decided to learn how to read Japanese so I could read literature and comics. The class was fun, and also super weird, since I was the only kid there. I took two semesters, but a lot of life happened at once, so I stopped taking Japanese, and didn’t being again until University, five years later. We used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yookoso-Invitation-Contemporary-Japanese-Learning/dp/0072971207">Yookoso!</a> textbook, and I crammed when I needed to. Outside of watching tv, barely had any practice outside of class. I wanted to visit Japan really bad, but for the time, paying rent was hard enough.</p>
<h2 id="post-college-life">Post-college life</h2>
<p>Eventually, I made it to Tokyo—Narita airport a few times, and finally to the city itself. I was both surprised how much I remembered, and depressed at how little I could read. It made sense though. I hadn’t studied in earnest in years, and I can’t say rote memorization was ever my strong suite. I started going to Japan a bit more regularly, and tried to practice, but focused on speaking over anything else. This eventually became more frustrating, because while I could type into Google translate, I never quite knew if the Kanji was correct. Izakayas—one of my favorite places to go—were especially challenging, because outside of saying 「すみません、ぼんじりがありますか?」(Excuse me, do you have chicken tail?) with different food names I knew, ordering was a bear.</p>
<h2 id="buckling-down">Buckling-down</h2>
<p>This year I’m going back to Japan again. At the prompting of my friend Jo, who spent a while living in Japan, I dug into <a href="https://www.wanikani.com">Wanikani</a> to formalize study of kanji. I realized that I would never get better at Japanese without memorizing kanji, which would also unlock a better vocabulary. Learning any language is a wild challenge, and with ~1800 kanji to go I feel deeply skeptical that I’ll ever be fluent. I’m glad trying, and as it stands currently I’m on a four-day streak. I also signed-up for a beta app called <a href="http://kanji.garden">Kanji Garden</a>, which has a slick interface. I pushed a bit hard the first few days of using that app, and have ~180 characters I’m reviewing. I remember a decent amount from my days of college classes, but hadn’t officially learned the kon’yomi and on’yomi readings, so it feels a bit like square one.</p>
<h2 id="heading">頑張って！</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this time next year as I prepare to go to Japan yet another time, I feel prepared to actually read quite a bit. It seems like if I really try to study every day, I’ll make some progress. I’m hopeful, and kind of excited for a future Brook that isn’t wandering around Koenji functionally illiterate.</p>

      <description>It’s a new year! Time to watch even more shows and movies, and with the rise of bingeable 10 hour TV movies, I have found myself watching fewer of the 90-120 minute variety. With Criteron launching a movie service, maybe that’ll change.
Books The Masked City — Genevieve Cogman
Another romp through alternate worlds with the rebellious librarian Irene, and her Sherlock stand-in pal Vale. The world of this book is largely a strange version of Venice, but more than the first book, other world’s tech is sprinkled throughout.</description>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><strong>The Masked City</strong> — Genevieve Cogman</p>
<p>Another romp through alternate worlds with the rebellious librarian Irene, and her Sherlock stand-in pal Vale. The world of this book is largely a strange version of Venice, but more than the first book, other world’s tech is sprinkled throughout. I’m starting to doubt that we’ll get a high-tech book in this series, but I still hold out hope. The language is a little <em>too</em> powerful as a deus machina, but Cogman finds ways Irene can’t deploy it constantly, and still manages to provide a level of tension and excitement.</p>
<p><strong>9th Step Station</strong> — Malka Older &amp; Co.</p>
<p>This read much like a series of Ghost in the Shell. From the NeoTokyo setting, to the ubiquitous cybernetic body mods, I expected Major Kusanagi to pop up at any juncture. That said, it also ruled. It’s been a long time since I read serialized fiction outside of comics, and the episodic nature made for a fun time. Each author added to the tale, instead of distracting with wild stylistic flourishes. I would happily read another series with Emma, Miyako, and the rest. There were less political machinations that I expected, based on other work from Older, but the story was fun, exciting, and well-told.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Close</strong></p>
<p>Noomi Rapace is a cool, collected bodyguard for a kinda shitty heiress who eventually grows to appreciate her help. Shout out to Indira Varma too, who was great in Luther, Game of Thrones, and now as a potentially treacherous stepmom.</p>
<p><strong>IO</strong></p>
<p>Another great eco-pocalypse movie. Limited cast and locations, but a cool premise overall. This movie was short, but definitely hit many of my speculative fiction check marks. I want to ride an ATV now.</p>
<p><strong>Vox Lux</strong></p>
<p>I loved the intense opening scenes of this film, and the scrolling credits—I’ve rarely seen something like this, and it felt brutal and fresh. Sadly the rest of the film felt like an idea that they forgot to film. Was she the devil? Didn’t explore that. Single mom? Didn’t explore that. There was so much buildup with no payoff. Terrorists? Nah. Long song b-roll? Yep. Even Sia couldn’t be bothered to record anything great for this film. Missed opportunity. This could‘be been Wicked and Divine, the movie.</p>
<p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p>
<p>Another film with Tony Kebbell—seeing him in this after seeing him in Hurricane Heist was a wild ride. I think his American accent got better. Also, Kusama seemed pretty obsessed with Kidman’s face throughout this film. This was a intense sad cop/revenge film, with elements from many old sad cop guy films—transformed into something new by letting the old cop be a woman. I really appreciated the Halt &amp; Catch Fire alumni, as well as the always delightful Tatiana Maslany. This movie felt like a different era, and painted LA in a grim, dusty light.</p>
<p><strong>Shoplifters</strong></p>
<p>What a fantastic film. In some ways this reminded me of the anime Tokyo Godfathers—which is also about a group of underground folks taking in a child. The way Shoplifters weaved chosen family in with delightful vignettes and outstanding performances by two children was masterful. This felt like a Japan that rarely appears in cinema—a group of folks struggling with poverty, and not sure how to be part of a society that seems to expect them to join in. I will probably rewatch this, and highly recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>Hurricane Heist</strong></p>
<p>I knew going in that this would be a bonkers film, having listened to the How Did This Get Made episode about it, but wow. Everyone in this film except for Maggie Grace is from England or Australia, and their accents are absurd. I feel like everyone got drunk, decided to use an “Alabama accent” and then a movie happened. Nothing that happened made sense, but also it was a hoot.</p>
<p><strong>Assasination Nation</strong></p>
<p>I’m still not sure what I saw. I <em>think</em> this aims to be a cautionary tale about mob rule, privacy, and misogyny. It’s brutal, graphic, and so full of -isms, I can’t say I recommend it. It’s wild that this movie played in theaters. I’m kinda stoked Hari Nef got to be a mean teen trans lady. By the end there’s a revenge bloodbath that I can’t tell if I was meant to find cathartic, or sad. This is definitely the most misanthropic and nihilistic movie I've seen in years.</p>
<h2 id="notable-tv">Notable TV</h2>
<p><strong>Tidying Up</strong></p>
<p>The masterfully Capricorn books on tidying-up are now a tv show. I watched all 8 episodes while cleaning my house, in one long fever-dream. Many of the couples are amazing, and at least one felt like they were on the verge of a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>Terror in Resonance</strong></p>
<p>An anime from a few years ago. The story is a relatively common one these days, of youth attempting to “wake up the world” through a pointed terrorism. The music from Yoko Kanno is <em>outstanding</em> but sadly doesn’t appear on streaming services, but is probably somewhere on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Into the Dark</strong></p>
<p>A horror-of-the-month series. Each story is a movie-length fright set in the month it premieres, from a murder on Halloween, to a woman dealing with agoraphobia around Thanksgiving. It’s well-shot, and probably worth checking out if you enjoy horror-ish films.</p>

      <description>This year I travelled quite a bit—almost 90 hours in the air. When I fly I always have my Kindle, but I usually find myself binge-watching a tv show, and keep my Plex loaded on my iPad with things to see. I watch shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime as well, but the local storage and caching isn’t always dependable for planes, and nothing is more disappointing than getting on a plane and finding out that your shows won’t play.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>This year I travelled quite a bit—almost 90 hours in the air. When I fly I always have my Kindle, but I usually find myself binge-watching a tv show, and keep my Plex loaded on my iPad with things to see. I watch shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime as well, but the local storage and caching isn’t always dependable for planes, and nothing is more disappointing than getting on a plane and finding out that your shows won’t play. These shows are a mix of joyful, and melancholy, and I loved each one.</p>
<p><strong>Patriot</strong></p>
<p>Sad spies. This isn’t a very well-named show, as many folks have covered. Reviewing this show feels <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/patriot-review-1159350">a little redundant</a> because so many folks have talked about it in my sphere of tech news, but it’s <em>amazing</em>. If you like whimsy, and dark comedy, this is a splendid blend of both.</p>
<p><strong>Terrace House: Boys and Girls Next Door</strong></p>
<p>This show is the one that started it all. I loved Boys and Girls in the City, and the <em>bonkers</em> Aloha State, and this year meant the end of the fan-subbing of the original show. There was a movie at the end of this series called Closing Doors that made me cry quite a bit as well. From the introduction of Seina, to the tireless Tecchan, and some of the weirdest folks ever on Terrace House, this season is spectacular. It’s a gentle show, that shows what randomly living with 5 strangers is like when the drama is low.</p>
<p><strong>Counterpart</strong></p>
<p>Another spy show, this time set in Berlin. I don’t want to spoil much, but it’s a show about parallel universes, memory, and growth. I love the vibe of this show, and the way they play with modern and old technology. In some ways this reminds me of Fringe, but with a more serious tone. Well-worth a watch, if you can find it—it plays on Starz.</p>
<p><strong>Veep</strong></p>
<p>This year I watched all of Veep, and in a time of political turmoil, when everything feels farcical, this show was perfect. Dreyfus leads a cast of masterful comedians, and the stories felt timely and fresh. I can’t wait for the next season. Everyone is so accidentally clever, idiotic, or hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>Killing Eve</strong></p>
<p>Lesbian tension + spies &amp; international assassin ladies. It’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Baskets</strong></p>
<p>Another dark comedy that I initially dismissed. Zach Galafanikis plays two brothers and Louie Anderson plays a perfect suburban mom with so much heart. I never quite knew what to expect from this show, and it took me from uproarious laughter to tears in a single episode.</p>
<p><strong>Billions</strong></p>
<p>Another show I initially thought was not my thing, but got sucked deep into. This show, similar to Veep, felt like a great way to satirize and use current events to tell a wild story of a determined state prosecutor and his battle against a hedge fund manager. I’ve loved Damian Lewis since his turn as a marine-to-terrorist in Homeland, and he is outstanding in this.</p>
<p><strong>Documental</strong></p>
<p>10 comedians. One room. A ticking clock. The last one standing wins their own $1000 and everyone else’s too. The level of goofy, absurd, and scatological comedy is off the charts, and I learned of a ton of weird comedians through this. This is a Japanese show, and I hope that it continues to be translated by Amazon, because there are 4 more season in Japan than the two we have so far.</p>
<h2 id="anime">Anime</h2>
<p><strong>Girl’s Last Tour</strong></p>
<p>Post-apocalyptic queer anime girls. A friend told me the writer of this show wanted to illustrate how it felt to be queer in Japan. I’m not sure how true that is, but it’s a great show about friendship, and exploration.</p>
<p><strong>A Place Further Than the Universe</strong></p>
<p>Beautiful and sad. This is a show about a woman’s journey to the South Pole to visit the site of her mom’s death, and the friends she makes along the way. It’s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>Kokkoku</strong></p>
<p>A show about family and time-stopping dimensional shifting. Out of the shows this season, this was one that I was excited to go back to each week. My friend Ren got me into watching anime again this year while in Portland, and it was lovely to get together with her every week with fried chicken wings and anime time.</p>

      <description>This year started off with one of the goofiest movies I’d see all year: Murder on the Orient Express. I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:
Hunt for the Wilderpeople
This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight.</description>

<p><strong>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</strong></p>
<p>This was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight. Family, rebellion, loss&hellip; ugh, I want to rewatch this right now.</p>
<p><strong>Black Panther</strong></p>
<p>Can you believe this came out in 2018? I got to see it in Oakland, and the crowd was dressed to the nines, and stoked AF about it. I saw Black Panther twice, and it’s the first super hero film in a while that made me smile and cheer throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Annihilation</strong></p>
<p>I loved this movie, for all that it didn’t hew to the book, and was bizarre. I’d loved the trilogy when I read it, but also enjoy Alex Garland’s films generally. I can’t say <em>why</em> I love this movie, but I do, and I saw it more than once.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry to Bother You</strong></p>
<p>I can’t say much about this indictment of capitalism and the gig-economy without spoiling it, but it’s excellent and you should go see it.</p>
<p><strong>Widows</strong></p>
<p>This movie felt like a dunk on the lackluster Oceans 8, and had everything I could want. The stakes were high, and even if it wasn’t the best at sustaining mystery, every woman in this film was outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>The Favourite</strong></p>
<p>Outstanding lesbian film. The humor in this movie was truly strange, and joyful. I feel like The Favourite came out of nowhere and blew me away, and except for a minor amount of rabbit-based fear, I was all the way here for it.</p>

      <description>Started in Japan Last year, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo before the countdown began, and landed in the evening of the 1st of January. Making my way to my rental apartment in Koenji, the city was quiet as folks celebrated with their family. It was a strange trip. I got to do my hatsumode at Meiji Jingu with thousands of people, and see the Emperor’s second to last speech before his groundbreaking abdication next year.</description>
      <content:encoded><h2 id="started-in-japan">Started in Japan</h2>
<p>Last year, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo before the countdown began, and landed in the evening of the 1st of January. Making my way to my rental apartment in Koenji, the city was quiet as folks celebrated with their family. It was a strange trip. I got to do my hatsumode at Meiji Jingu with thousands of people, and see the Emperor’s second to last speech before his groundbreaking abdication next year. Parks were closed, but fortunately, izakayas were open. My friend Magda met up with me later that week, and I showed her Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. It was her first trip to Japan, and we both had a blast eating food and visiting a cool ryokan.</p>
<h2 id="portland-interlude">Portland (interlude)</h2>
<p>I spent very little time in Portland this year, it felt like. I traveled slightly less than in 2017, but between bouncing back and forth to Oakland and San Francisco for work and various trips abroad, Snorri and my Portland friends saw me half of every month. I lifted as often as I could, and competed in two internal <a href="/blog/2018/08/14/powerlifting">powerlifting</a> meets. I kept running the board of directors for Basic Rights too. But increasingly, Portland felt like the wrong place for me. When I was in town, I often found myself spending lots of time alone, cooking and eating at home, or seeing movies solo. <a href="/blog/2018/09/10/xoxo-thoughts">XOXO this year</a> was fun, but the friends I spent most of it with were all from the bay. I’d made and lost many friends, and my energy was low. I started thinking more seriously about moving to Oakland during a really busy time at work, so it took a bit for things to settle. Once they did, my company was part of Slack, and I was suddenly moving to Emeryville. I’ll miss so many of my friends in Portland, but as living halfway there and the bay for a few years taught me, it’s a quick flight.</p>
<h2 id="berlin">Berlin</h2>
<p>My partner suggested offhandedly at one point that they were going to Europe for a conference, and that it would be cool to meet up in Berlin. I bit, and immediately booked tickets. We stayed in Neukölln, near Tempelhofer Fields, and I immediately fell for the city, the Berliner Weiss, and the vibe. More than a few folks I know have since or before moved to Berlin, and despite wild bureaucratic issues, it seems like a very interesting place to live. I ate tons of döner kebab, and loved visiting LiquidRom (a place I’d described as a brutalist day spa). Mads and I had never spent that long together, and it definitely brought us closer together. I flew home happy, and looking forward to visiting again, and had just about a week in Portland before I flew off again.</p>
<h2 id="copenhagen">Copenhagen</h2>
<p>This time, I was on my way via SFO to Copenhagen with my coworkers Brian and Mark to attend and run a booth at KubeCon. It was so, <em>so</em> busy. We ate a lot of smørrebrø, worked out in an old slaughterhouse, and generally had a blast. I spent an extra week there alone, with only a couple days a bit wasted by my conference-acquired cold. Vesterbro was really cool, though I still think it’s odd how many all-you-can-eat sushi places there were. I never rode a bike, which in retrospect is super odd, but I did drink a lot of aquavit, and ate a <em>ton</em> of wienerschnitzel. This turned out to be my last international trip of the year, despite my hope that I could get back to Japan in the fall.</p>
<h2 id="so-many-flights-to-sfo">So many flights to SFO</h2>
<p>Various circumstances meant I was flying back and forth to SFO more than once a month during the summer and early fall. There were early morning flights with afternoons returning to Portland for poorly-timed obligations. There were flights with friends, and lots of solo flights. Somehow I never quite managed to get status on a single airline. Near the end of my constant flying, I was happy to learn my new company wanted me to move to the bay by the end of October, and my friend Haley helpfully found me a lovely apartment near lots of friends at the edges of Emeryville and Berkeley. I signed the lease sight-unseen, on the assurance of my partner and the video they took that it was fantastic. It was, in fact, incredible. I finished up everything I could in Portland, had movers come, and took Snorri and myself to our new home.</p>
<h2 id="settling-into-a-new-eville-life">Settling into a new Eville life</h2>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2018/11/21/moving-to-the-bay.html">wrote about moving to Emeryville</a> a while ago, and since then it’s gotten even better. I feel like I’ve settled into a schedule here that includes powerlifting, seeing friends, and taking care of my growing plant collection. A very mild fall means I get to wear all my light jackets, and my short bus commute to work led to ample time reading. It’s been great only bringing an <a href="/blog/2018/11/07/new-ipad-review">iPad Pro</a> to and from work for the past few months, and I feel lucky I get to leave my work, and work computer at the office. The holidays were better than I feared, and I got to spend time with a few friends here in the bay, as well as enjoy candles, snacks, and books in my cozy home. It also rules to finally live in the same city as my partner, and figuring out a good cadence in our hangouts has been fun, if sometimes tricky. I hope to spend many more years here.</p>
<h2 id="looking-towards-2019">Looking towards 2019</h2>
<p>I’m hopeful 2019 will lead to more books, movies, and fun times with friends and loved ones. Work is amazing, and it feels great to be at a company I really believe in, helping create a product I love using every day. I’m also staying on the board at Basic Rights, and I continue to be proud of our work in immigration rights, trans rights, and racial justice. So much of making this country a better place for everyone means small local changes, and I’m glad to be a small part of that work. I might try to compete more at powerlifting, and I definitely want to go back to Japan and Scandinavia if possible. The economy, at the time I’m writing this, looks like it’s headed towards a shit place, but I hope to keep saving money throughout the year. If everything works out, I’ll even get Snorri a new friend, so he doesn’t have to wait for me to get home from work alone every day. 2019 is another year—a fresh year to live and learn in. I’m looking forward to it.</p>

      <description>Books Provenance — Ann Leckie
A different planet and culture than the Raadchai from her trilogy, but a very compelling story. I got very confused for a while about who was who, but eventually I sorted it out.
The Dark Archive — Victoria Schwab **
A fun, strange YA book about what happens after death, and the teens who defend the afterlife. There were some cool twists, and story details throughout, but the world building could have been better.</description>

<p><strong>Provenance</strong> — Ann Leckie</p>
<p>A different planet and culture than the Raadchai from her trilogy, but a very compelling story. I got very confused for a while about who was who, but eventually I sorted it out.</p>
<p><strong>The Dark Archive</strong> — Victoria Schwab <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>A fun, strange YA book about what happens after death, and the teens who defend the afterlife. There were some cool twists, and story details throughout, but the world building could have been better. Honestly every time I read one of these, I think, &ldquo;wouldn’t this be better if it were gay?&quot;, and reader, yes, yes it would. These sorts of books must really speak to teens though, because they portray adults as largely ineffectual idiots, who occasionally get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>The Equalizer: 2</strong></p>
<p>This is apparent the first sequel Denzel has ever made. I’ve loved the genre of Denzel as an ultraviolent avenging angel ever since I saw Man on Fire. Some folks may prefer John Wick, and granted, those movies have a great style, but damn, the Equalizer is a series I hope to see more of in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Death of Stalin</strong> (rewatch)</p>
<p>It’s the season for rewatching films.</p>
<p><strong>Slice</strong></p>
<p>Super goofy horror film with lots of great folks. I think B movies can only rarely be made great from the start, and this one could’ve used a little less effort.</p>
<p><strong>The Fast &amp; the Furious</strong> (rewatch)</p>
<p>A few friends hadn’t watched this before, so we drank a bit, and had a rip-roaring good time seeing this again. Everyone is decked-out in the most late 90s gear, the camera work is bonkers, and the cars are cool, but painted like awful hot wheels. I <em>love</em> this series.h</p>
<p><strong>Hereditary</strong></p>
<p>Granted, the central twist was spoiled for me, but so much of this movie felt joyless. Theoretically this movie should’ve been right up my alley, but honestly I would’ve rather rewatched the VVitch for the umpteenth time.</p>
<p><strong>Widows</strong></p>
<p>This was one of my favorite movies of the year. Wow. A all badass lady heist movie with actual stakes! Everyone delivers in this film, and it was a hoot. A+</p>
<p><strong>Crazy Rich Asians</strong></p>
<p>This was a schlocky romcom about a very rarefied set of Chinese Singaporeans. It was fun enough, and now both of the people I saw it with want to flood the aisle of a building during their wedding. Moms are a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Girl with a Dragon Tattoo</strong> (rewatch)</p>
<p>My partner hasn’t seen these, and I would watch them again basically whenever, so here we are.</p>
<p><strong>Ant Man and the Wasp</strong> (rewatch)</p>
<p>Just as delightful the second go-round. More fun superhero movies please.</p>

      <description>in no particular order On Apple Music
The list Dilly Dally Heaven: I listened to this amazing band’s first album so much in the three years since it came out, and the vocal delivery is raw and beautiful. A true jam.
Ex:Re Ex:Re: A delightfully sad and smart album about lost love, and healing. This was a late-arrival this year, and has already been a constant repeat.
Anna McClellan Yes and No: A similarly raw singing style to Dilly Dally, this is a bummer jam.</description>
      <content:encoded><p><em>in no particular order</em> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/favorites-of-2018/pl.u-PJExpCqGgBj">On Apple Music</a></p>
<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>
<p><strong>Dilly Dally</strong> <em>Heaven</em>: I listened to this amazing band’s first album so much in the three years since it came out, and the vocal delivery is raw and beautiful. A true jam.</p>
<p><strong>Ex:Re</strong> <em>Ex:Re</em>: A delightfully sad and smart album about lost love, and healing. This was a late-arrival this year, and has already been a constant repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Anna McClellan</strong> <em>Yes and No</em>: A similarly raw singing style to Dilly Dally, this is a bummer jam. The juxtaposition between her low, gritty voice, and when she moves into a higher register is fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Gia Margaret</strong> <em>There’s Always a Glimmer</em>: Continuing down the bummer album trail, Gia Margaret created a gorgeous album that combines piano, light percussion, and a hint of electronics to create an album that perfectly compliments how I feel when I’m lost in thought.</p>
<p><strong>The Beths</strong> <em>Future Hates Me</em>: This album <em>rips</em>! Like, wow. What a fantastic, tightly instrumented, and infectious pop-punk album. This is a band to watch. It’s almost impossible not to sing along to this.</p>
<p><strong>The Internet</strong> <em>Hive Mind</em>: This is a blessed year—right after getting a new Syd album, 2018 brings a new album from The Internet. Every track is a bop, and is a good way to come back up from some of the bummer tunes listed above.</p>
<p><strong>Tirzah</strong> <em>Devotion</em>: This album feels stripped down to the core of Tirzah’s voice. There’s light instrumentation, and just hypnotic melodies and just enough percussion to get you going.</p>
<p><strong>Svalbard</strong> <em>It’s Hard to Have Hope</em>: This album encapsulates so much of the pain and anger of being a woman in the 2010s. Tracks cover abortion, feminism, and a lot more. Crank this up when you’re lifting weights, or just need to feel seen for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Remember Sports</strong> <em>Slow Buzz</em>: More amazing pop punk from a band I’ve been repeatedly listening to from before they had to change their name to “Remember Sports”. Their lyrics crack me up sometimes, and I feel real joy listening to these tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Camp Cope</strong> <em>How to Socialise and Make Friends</em>: This is just solid indie rock. I love the lead woman’s voice, and the songs have a punk ethos and feeling, even as they’re a bit slower paced.</p>
<p><strong>Sara Renberg</strong> <em>Night Sands</em>: “I googled elderly lesbians to cheer myself, but the results were all porn”. The grim humor and fantastic delivery of the vocals on this album made me repeat it often. Another great “yea that’s how I’m feeling exactly!” jam.</p>
<p><strong>Hop Along</strong> <em>Bark Your Head Off, Dog</em>: This was definitely a year for listening to gritty female vocals. I have no clue how she sings this way on tour without just shredding her throat, but also it’s so, so fucking good. Every Hop Along album has ruled, and this might be my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>Half Waif</strong> <em>Lavender</em>: I cried to this album on planes a lot this year. Half Waif rules, and if my other picks were kinda rough, her voice might be a salve. This is <em>only her second album</em> and there’s already so much depth.</p>
<p><strong>Soccer Mommy</strong> <em>Clean</em>: Another really, really pretty and sad album. The vibe of this album is so perfect for Fall.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Eat Grandma</strong> <em>I’m All Ears</em>: This music makes me dance. I got to see them perform earlier this year, and even in Portland, people were getting down. It’s also super clear the women in this band are just stoked to be making these jams.</p>
<p><strong>Tancred</strong> <em>Nightstand</em>: One of the gayer albums I loved this year. At times she reminds me of PJ Harvey, or Fiona Apple. The phrasing and style of her delivery is pitch-perfect.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-note-on-listening-this-year">A note on listening this year</h2>
<p>This isn’t a comprehensive list of what I listened to by any means, and by switching to Apple Music partway through the year, my listening is fractured in a way that’s hard to glue together. Music at home often happens on my Sonos, and still gets sent to Last.fm, I think, but anything on mobile (most of my time) is mostly locally stored as history.</p>

      <title>2018 iPhone Homescreen</title>

      <description>Back to a single screen.
It’s been a year and change since I posted about my iPhone apps and homescreen. I tend to try out new apps pretty often, but now that I use an iPad and an Apple Watch every day, I generally stick with things that support all 3 of my screens well. Some apps have stuck around, but many have been replaced by better (for me) choices. Trying to settle into apps that I use for a long stretch is challenging as businesses fail, or apps stagnate, so here we are.</description>

<p>It’s been a year and change since I posted about my <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/2017-homescreen-ac92817eae60">iPhone apps and homescreen</a>. I tend to try out new apps pretty often, but now that I use an iPad and an Apple Watch every day, I generally stick with things that support all 3 of my screens well. Some apps have stuck around, but many have been replaced by better (for me) choices. Trying to settle into apps that I use for a long stretch is challenging as businesses fail, or apps stagnate, so here we are.</p>
<h2 id="old-apps">Old apps</h2>
<p><strong>Timepage</strong>—without support for the new style of WatchOS complications, I switched to Fantastical again. I don’t <em>love</em> it, but I want to use the same app in both places.</p>
<p><strong>Casts</strong>—replaced with <strong>Overcast</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Maps</strong>—replaced with <strong>Google Maps</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Airmail</strong>—replaced with <strong>Spark</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong>—replaced with <strong>Tweetbot</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify</strong>—replaced with <strong>Apple Music</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong>—I quit Instagram around the start of 2018 in a dual-effort to rid myself of FB-owned apps, and to stop using an increasingly user-antagonistic app that really bummed me out more than it made me happy.</p>
<p><strong>Todoist</strong>—replaced with <strong>Things</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Google Photos</strong>—replaced with <strong>Apple Photos</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>iCloud Drive</strong>—this became <strong>Files</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tons of folders</strong>—this felt overwhelming, and eventually I decided against it, and went back to titles instead of emoji, and now whittled my apps down to a single folder.</p>
<h2 id="new-apps">New apps</h2>
<p><strong>Fantastical</strong>—this is an <em>ok</em> calendaring app. I don't love the visual style, or the colors, but compared to my other options this is what I have available. Timepage doesn't have new watch complications. Google Calendar doesn't even have a watch app. iOS Calendar is ok, but doesn't do NLP well, or handle meetings/etc well. This is definitely the app I am most interested in replacing.</p>
<p><strong>Fiery Feeds</strong>—Reeder 4 is perpetually <em>coming soon</em>, so my allegiance to it is on pause until the 4th iteration brings support for my new iPad, and other nice things like full-text display. Fiery Feeds, despite an icon that I vaguely loathe, is a great app with a solid dark mode, and a bunch of cool options. It's very customizable, and can adapt a bit to your style of RSS. I wish it had a Mac app, but AFAIK the only great RSS reader that works everywhere is Reeder.</p>
<p><strong>Spark</strong>—I don't use email as often anymore now that I work at a company that doesn't use email (we really don't). But, when I do, Spark is great. Solid watch app. Solid Mac and iPad support, including keyboard shortcuts. I still hope for iOS dark mode support in the future, because on Mac the style is awesome. The calendar in this app is <em>almost</em> good enough to have me ditch my actual calendar, but unfortunately there's no way for Spark to show its calendar on my watch.</p>
<p><strong>Tweetbot</strong>—<a href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com">RIP third-party Twitter apps</a>. I use this app in defiance of Twitter's bad policy, and honestly the lack of likes and notifications is kind of a feature for me at this point. DMs are vaguely useless, but most of those conversations have moved to my favorite place to chat: Slack.</p>
<p><strong>Google Maps</strong>—I used Apple Maps pretty happily for a while, but eventually I wanted more recommendations and ratings, and I refuse to use Yelp for that. If Apple Maps connected to Foursquare, or supported commute scheduling, I'd be back in a heartbeat. Also somehow Google Maps understands that SF trans-bay busses pick up at a temporary terminal, and Apple things they don't exist because the Salesforce garden of hubris is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Things</strong>—I love Things. Years ago when I worked for a certain fruit company, many of my coworkers used Things. I didn't really get it at the time, but also I didn't really get having things _to do_. Things helps me be an adult, and get things done. I run my life out of here, largely, and dump anything from chores to tv show recommendations in here. The new iOS dark mode support is spectacular. Similarly to Spark, the support of a calendar is <em>almost</em> good enough to not use a calendar app, but alas, the watch problem persists. Also the calendar is read-only, which could create an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Music</strong>—I moved over from Spotify, mostly to try it out, and to have access to my music on my watch. It's fine? I don't really know if I prefer this app to Spotify, but it does what I want, plays the music I want to play, and works well on my Sonos and in my car. Recommendations have gotten better, and while I wish it did a better job of knowing which bands I like have new albums, I usually find out. Concert notifications would also be cool, if I were making a feature request. Oh, and also dark mode. Please.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-of-the-rest">The best of the rest</h2>
<p><strong>Slack</strong>—My love for the Slack app is strong. My friends live here. My chosen family lives here. My work lives here. I don't know what I would do without Slack. Before I worked for Slack, my company depended on Slack for everything from deploys, to bugs, to developer relations. Now that I work here, I'm so happy how much I can accomplish inside of Slack. There's no way to fully express how much joy I feel doing my work in Slack. Seriously. This app redefines work.</p>
<p><strong>Bear</strong>—I really like Bear. Many notes that have actions end up in Things, but Bear is my dumping ground for workout stats, meeting notes, travel lists, and other assorted ephemera. When I wrote about Bear in 2017, I did more of my long-form writing in it, but now that has mostly moved to iAWriter. Bear always felt a little weird for long-form writing, and iAWriter's new duospaced font is <em>chef's kiss</em>. I still wish I could choose a black theme with a custom highlight color, because I hate orange and gold, but çest la vie.</p>
<p><strong>iAWriter</strong>—this app lives in a folder, but for my iPad and my Mac, it's how I write. The ability to open files that life in Working Copy, that really live in a Github repo that runs this site is ideal The colors are what I would choose if I had full-control. It's truly a masterful writing app.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-a-search-first-model">Moving to a “search first” model</h2>
<p>When I moved all of my apps to one screen, and began stuffing the majority in a single folder, I wanted to see if I would use search. On my iPad or my Mac, I almost always open apps with Spotlight, but on my iPhone, I usually would flick through screens or folders, aimlessly looking for <em>something to tap</em>, or even hunt for the app I use to book movie tickets. This felt like a waste of time, and further, became a nervous habit. Now that I mostly search for apps, I find myself doing less nervous flicking, and mostly put my phone down when I don't have something to <em>do</em> with it. Out of sight, out of mind seems to be effective for me—maybe that says something about my object permanence? Lol.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I really want a new calendar app. I want someone to come into the calendar world and shake it up—or I want Spark or Things to have access to show their calendar on my watch. Or, I want Timepage to update their watch integration. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with my setup at this point, and find my phone helpful, pleasant, and additive. I'm curious to see how many of these apps I use again a year from now, but I have a feeling the list might not shift much. If you're a phone fidgeter, I definitely recommend putting most of your apps in one folder, and maybe even <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/reclaim-your-time-with-parental-controls-9224612a6c1b"><em>reclaiming your time</em></a>. If you have apps you <em>love</em> that you want to talk about, hit me up @brookshelley on Twitter, or leave a small gift at the base of the largest tree in your town. I will know.</p>

      <description>Queers and Steers As a Texan, and a lesbian, I knew eventually I’d end up in California. That’s what we do. We leave Texas, and go west. I’ve spent the past four years hundreds of miles north in Portland, OR working remotely for various companies. I loved the trees, and the few amazing friends I made there, but found it hard to get through the long, lonely winters. It didn’t help that most of my jobs were remote—Portland has a burgeoning tech scene, but in general jobs haven’t kept up with rising cost of living.</description>

<p>As a Texan, and a lesbian, I knew eventually I’d end up in California. That’s what we do. We leave Texas, and go west. I’ve spent the past four years hundreds of miles north in Portland, OR working remotely for various companies. I loved the trees, and the few amazing friends I made there, but found it hard to get through the long, lonely winters. It didn’t help that most of my jobs were remote—Portland has a burgeoning tech scene, but in general jobs haven’t kept up with rising cost of living. Working remotely meant rent was easier to pay, but that most of my world existed elsewhere. This all changed when <a href="https://www.turbinelabs.io">my last company</a>, my favorite job ever, shut down and went to work for <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>. I joined in the fun. Working for Slack, for me, also meant moving to the bay.</p>
<h2 id="fast-as-you-can">Fast as you can</h2>
<p>From the time I knew I had a job at Slack, to moving was all of two weeks. I started as soon as I could to ensure I didn’t run out of cash, and with the help of a moving company, all my stuff was packed-up and shipped the Saturday before my second week of work. Sunday meant driving Snorri, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/local___honey">Amanda</a>, and some clothes for 10 hours to my new home <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeryville,_California">near an IKEA</a>. It was a pretty drive, despite all the wild rain, and switchbacks. Snorri yelled intermittently.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/driving.jpeg" alt="driving"></p>
<p>Eventually, we arrived, quickly looted an IKEA for a few chairs, and set up my weird apartment. My stuff wouldn’t arrive for 2 weeks, so I was living that cool spy life until then.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/spylife.jpeg" alt="spy life"></p>
<h2 id="a-month-flew-by">A month flew by</h2>
<p>This week is my 5th at Slack, and I’ve already learned so much. My coworkers are rad as hell, the office is unbelievable, and for the first time in years I get to work on a product I’ve used since its inception—one that I earnestly love to use. Slack is where my friends live, where I talk to my chosen family. Slack is how I interact, increasingly, with every app that I use. It’s still amazing to me that I get to work there, and influence how API features and partnerships are built out. Seriously. Wow.</p>
<p>Snorri is still settling in, it feels like, especially due to his insistence that daylight savings doesn’t exist, and we must still eat breakfast at dawn. I think he misses his friend, Prince, but hopefully he’ll get a new one sooner than later. For a little while, I worried he’d get sick because he wasn’t eating much, but now he seems to love a variety of wet food, and even his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0146QXOB0?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAPcR">fancy cat fountain</a>. He’s still getting used to me working out of the house every day, and seems to relish my semi-shut-in status while the smoke from the horrific fires in California rage in the north and south of my new state.</p>
<h2 id="bay-life">Bay life</h2>
<p>I’m looking forward to exploring the city more, finding tons of plants to outfit my place, and enjoying regular sunlight soon. It’s great to know so many of my friends live here, and now I can see them more than the once a month I spent here before moving to the bay. In addition to just wandering, I hope to get a few museum memberships, and get involved in the arts and music scene in a way I didn’t feel able to in Portland. I’ll miss the evergreens, and my friends, but so far this feels like a very good move.</p>

      <description>Books Circe &amp;ndash; Madeline Miller
This book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you&#39;ve read the Odyssey, this is a must read.
Red Clocks &amp;ndash; Leni Zumas
A bit too close to our dystopian reality for my liking, but this was well-written, and full of strong and interesting women.</description>

<p><strong>Circe</strong> &ndash; Madeline Miller</p>
<p>This book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you've read the Odyssey, this is a must read.</p>
<p><strong>Red Clocks</strong> &ndash; Leni Zumas</p>
<p>A bit too close to our dystopian reality for my liking, but this was well-written, and full of strong and interesting women. I read this as I was leaving Oregon, and so a lot of it was a little bittersweet. This reads as a more realistic (sadly) handmaid's tale.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Skyscraper</strong></p>
<p>So, so ridiculous and terrible&hellip; but also kind of great? Like, what if Die Hard wasn't as good, and had the Rock in Hong Kong? I watched this so I could listen to this week's How Did This Get Made, and I am glad I did.</p>
<p><strong>The Girl in the Spider's Web</strong></p>
<p>We're on our third Lisbeth actress, and while Claire Foy more than filled the shoes of Rooney Mara, the same can't quite be said for whoever replaced Daniel Craig. This was a fun, twisty movie, that was inadvertently stressful for my partner because of all the snow and ice driving. Lisbeth continues to deliver her brand of justice, while &ldquo;then Lisbeth hacks the thing&rdquo; is a major plot device. Kudos to all the lesbians in this, and the giant case of dildos. Fun movie.</p>
<p><strong>The Guilty</strong></p>
<p>A wild single-room movie, that takes place completely over the phone. I love the narrative device, and the slow, dread-filled pacing. The movie largely takes place in your own imagination, helped along by excellent foley, and voice acting.</p>
<p><strong>The First Purge</strong></p>
<p>Yow, what a good mess. I don't know why I love the Purge films, and to be honest, this one felt a little too real. However, I watched this on Halloween, so it fit my needs of a spooky, scary movie.</p>
<p><strong>Halloween (2018)</strong></p>
<p>This was goofy and fun, while still being a twisty thriller. Ultimately, these are morality tales about private property ownership, lol. A+ to Jamie Lee Curtis, and also all the random bit players. Definitely a good popcorn flick with friends.</p>

      <title>2018 iPad Pro Review</title>

      <description>Today my phone buzzed to tell me my new iPad had arrived at my office. I rushed down to the mailroom, and eagerly ripped open the packaging. For a few years I’ve used an iPad Pro 9.7” as my primary travel computer when I didn’t need to work on Kubernetes/DevOps stuff, and I’ve loved it. Whether I was watching shows on Netflix or Plex that I’d downloaded before a flight, editing my website in Working Copy, or just editing photos and browsing Twitter, this was the machine I wanted to use.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Today my phone buzzed to tell me my new iPad had arrived at my office. I rushed down to the mailroom, and eagerly ripped open the packaging. For a few years I’ve used an iPad Pro 9.7” as my primary travel computer when I didn’t need to work on Kubernetes/DevOps stuff, and I’ve loved it. Whether I was watching shows on Netflix or Plex that I’d downloaded before a flight, editing my website in Working Copy, or just editing photos and browsing Twitter, this was the machine I wanted to use.</p>
<p>Now, I have 1.3” more screen, a more lap-capable keyboard, and 120hz refresh, and I couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/ipad.jpeg" alt="iPad"></p>
<h2 id="the-screen">The screen</h2>
<p>This iPad might not feel like as huge of a revelation to someone who used the 10.5”, but coming from the 9.7”, this screen feels luxurious. The smooth 120hz refresh rate means opening apps, and moving around looks amazing. The color and viewing angles are still the best in the tablet world, and make my even my MacBook feel like a relic of the past. It’s responsive, bright, and a joy to watch tv on.</p>
<h2 id="the-case">The case</h2>
<p>My iPad is the Space Grey color, and it looks excellent. The industrial lines of the sides are reminiscent of my favorite iPhone, the 4. Overall the iPad feels thin, and around the weight of my 9.7” even with the added screen size, and when I have it out of the keyboard folio, I don’t want to put it down. This tablet feels great in my hands. I seriously hope that Apple brings this design language to the next generation of iPhones, even though I wonder if they can while still keeping the glass back for wireless charging.</p>
<h2 id="the-keyboard-folio">The keyboard folio</h2>
<p>My main use of the iPad is with a keyboard attached, as I use it as a laptop mostly, which sometimes becomes a handheld tablet for reading. I’m still not convinced there needed to be two viewing angles, but the stiffness and lack of weird folding means it feels pretty great in my lap or on a desk. The tablet-mode keyboard against your fingers thing is slightly odd, but it also reminds me of playing the accordion, which I find funny enough to enjoy it. The keys feel nice and responsive, and largely the same as the 9.7” keyboard. If they changed the keys, I can’t tell. I do enjoy the slightly larger size that matches the bigger device, and my mistypes are few and far-between. Clicking the iPad into the folio feels fast and easy, even if it requires slightly more lining up than previously. With the folio closed, the iPad feel grippy, and like a thin notebook in the best way. The weight and feel, in my opinion, remind you that you’re holding a high quality device. The folio adds a little thickness, but I think it only brings the device to the previous size, so I haven’t felt like it was too thick.</p>
<h2 id="usb-c">USB-C</h2>
<p>It’s great. I love using the same charger for this iPad and my MacBook. I already invested in USB-C to lighting cables, so bringing this iPad and no USB spare battery for my iPhone sounds great. I haven’t tried plugging anything weird into the port, but folks at the Verge did their damndest to stump the port. <em>Spoiler</em> it doesn’t work with printers.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>It’s about the same as my old iPad, which is excellent.</p>
<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>
<p>There’s four of them. They’re loud, and clear. A+</p>
<h2 id="faceid">FaceID</h2>
<p>Just as quick and easy as my previous iPhone X, and possibly a little slower than the XS. I can’t quite tell, but I feel a little like I’m waiting now compared to using my phone. I haven’t timed it though, but generally it’s much better and easier than the TouchID.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>This is the iPad to get—whether you get the 12.9” or the 11”, especially if you haven’t upgraded in a few years. I seriously feel like this is the future of Apple computing, and iOS 13 is sure to bring more advanced features that mean I might not need a Mac outside of my office.</p>

      <description>Books Sympathy — Olivia Sudjic *
Wow, I loved this book. A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It&#39;s also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.</description>

<p><strong>Sympathy</strong> — Olivia Sudjic <a href="#les">*</a></p>
<p>Wow, I loved this book. A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It's also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.</p>
<p><strong>Invasions</strong> — Calvin Gimpelevich</p>
<p><a href="_posts/2018-10-14-invasions-review.md">My review</a>. TL;DR it was great. Buy it.</p>
<p><strong>Love &amp; Estrogen</strong> &ndash; Samantha Allen</p>
<p>I don't usually read trans memoir&ndash;and I have a forthcoming piece that challenges and lampoons it to a degree&ndash;but Samantha is a friend and her story is close to my heart because of that. I had the chance to chat with her a lot through the course of part of this love and transition story, and I enjoyed the way she told it. This memoir definitely touched on some of the tropes of the genre, but by also being a wonderful love story, it manages to eschew many more.</p>
<p><strong>The Tea Master &amp; the Detective</strong> &ndash; Aliette de Bodard <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>This was a fun detective tale with a mysterious Sherlock and a spaceship Watson. The setup never quite paid off with its mystery, but I look forward to reading more hooks in the series. I also worried a bit that it would fetishize or exoticize Chinese culture, but outside of the space-protection tea, it largely doesn't come up.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Halloween</strong></p>
<p>A spooky throwback to get ready for the sequel. I guess they made a bunch of these and they were all garbage, and the new movie aims to erase them. I <em>think</em> somehow the only one I'd seen was Season of the Witch, which is the 3rd movie in the original set. The 70s were a weird time, and the amount of nudity random &ldquo;gotta take my clothes off&rdquo; is just yikes. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job. I'm hoping the pacing of the new film is more up to modern standards though, because dang, did this feel dated and slow in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Artemis</strong></p>
<p>From the preview, I assumed this would be a John Wick knockoff, but it was fun in its own right. Lots of action, Jenny Slate, and a wide array of solid actors. The future is a dismal one, but hey, that checks out.</p>
<p><strong>Beirut</strong></p>
<p>What if John Hamm's Mad Men character was a state department guy turned negotiator? 70s Beirut is a trip in the way it's presented, and knowing a little history, this seems like a wild but semi-accurate portrayal of all the folks who fought over Lebanon during and after the civil war. This is a tonally dark political thriller, and I dug it.</p>
<p><strong>Venom</strong></p>
<p>What a perfectly odd anti-hero film. I was a big Venom fan as a kid, and this movie delivered everything I wanted in a Venom movie. Fuck the haters, this is a hoot. I don't think this should win any prizes for <em>cinema</em> but it's fun, and provided lots of awkward laughs. The action was exciting, and I can't wait for a sequel full of <em>carnage</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sicario: Day of the Solado</strong></p>
<p>Another ridiculous action film about &ldquo;the cartels&rdquo; that I can't honestly tell is meant to make folks dislike the US or root for us. If you want to watch Cable/Thanos run around and shoot things, this is probalby a good movie for you. I don't find these very clever, but mostly I wish we got an Equalizer-style movie focused on Benecio Del Toro's character. While I'm hoping, perhaps Demián Bichir can be in the third movie.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong></p>
<p>A weirdo pyschadelic mess of a movie. I hate that a woman's death is used as a catalyst, but beyond that this is a bloody, ridiculous revenge flick. The music is great throughout and perhaps we were all delirious, but my theater laughed quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Dawn of the Dead</strong> (2004/Rewatch)</p>
<p>I could watch this every year. This is an excellent remake of an excellent zombie film. Everyone gives their all, and so many of the deaths, kills, and twists are perfect. A+ work from before Zach Snyder made cruddy films.</p>

      <title>A Review of Invasions</title>

      <description>It begins with a rip, the tearing sound of velcro—mix and match nipples kick off this delightfully strange collection of speculative fiction, trans body-horror, and water-logged zombies. Calvin impressed me last year with his part in Meanwhile, Elsewhere, revisited here as the excellent Rent, Don&#39;t Sell. This story explores a world in which bodies are traded for a time for fitness or fetish and how trans people deal with this faustian bargain.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>It begins with a rip, the tearing sound of velcro—mix and match nipples kick off this <a href="http://www.instarbooks.com/books/invasions.html">delightfully strange collection</a> of speculative fiction, trans body-horror, and water-logged zombies. Calvin impressed me last year with his part in <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/a-review-of-meanwhile-elsewhere-166ec11bff7d">Meanwhile, Elsewhere</a>, revisited here as the excellent Rent, Don't Sell. This story explores a world in which bodies are traded for a time for fitness or fetish and how trans people deal with this faustian bargain. Another tale invites us to an isolated cabin for a wedding party that begins to fray at the edges in a blizzard. And, while every story isn't is a life-or-death one, but the weight of mortality permeates each page.</p>
<p>Whether the reader is wandering a bathhouse, stumbling through the streets, newly minted as a middle-aged-man, we are reminded each time that the world doesn't quite fit us. Invasions captures the feeling of being trans, even in innocuous settings. It's never Cronenberg, but regardless of how wild the twist, it's grounded and bodied in a way he couldn't imagine. Occasionally, a story follows an ostensibly cisgender person, to probe the space around a trans life, and to me these are the most speculative: &ldquo;What do they see in us? What do they think?&rdquo; To answer this question, one protagonist even employs a psychic talent to sift through memory and desire in those around him, even through their final moments.</p>
<p>This collection also challenges ideas around surgery, queer bodies, and perception. In Eternal Boy, we meet a queer person figuring out their gender, but at odds with their presentation as a boy; they're uncertain about the way women see them, but also willing to overlook those feelings for a chance to hook up. These characters are complicated; they're often anti-heroes, or even villains. We need more trans villains in a world of trans characters that are almost always a sob story or a heartwarming tale. I'm here for the dirty, confused, angry, and alien.</p>
<p>One of closing stories is about a surgery center full of the wild variety of trans folks I've met: from older late-transitioning women, to confident girls with their moms. Not content to let cis people be the only foil for trans protagonists, Calvin writes the interplay between intergenerational and intergender conflict and love wonderfully. On the heels of You Wouldn't Have Known is the more general body horror of pregnancy and a failure of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Invasions is one of the best collections I've read in quite some time, and I can't wait to see Calvin's next book or collection. <a href="http://www.instarbooks.com/books/invasions.html">Pick up a copy today</a>. This writer is one to watch, and tell your friends about—a real trans-writers-writer. He delivered on the promise of his story in Meanwhile, Elsewhere with gusto, and blew this reader away.</p>

      <title>DSPTCH Waist Bag Review</title>
      <link>https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-04-dsptch-waist-bag/</link>

      <description>Recently, I ordered a medium Sling Pack after deciding I wanted a very small bag to bring with me to meetings or coffee shops where I only needed my iPad and a few other sundries. 11pm is not a great time to make decisions, so I clicked the order button before I checked measurements, and was sad when I realized it didn&#39;t actually fit my 9.7&amp;rdquo; iPad. Luckily, I was already flying to San Francisco a week later, and was able to exchange it for the Waist Bag, after trying it on in the store.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Recently, I ordered a <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/collections/packs/products/sling-pouch-medium">medium Sling Pack</a> after deciding I wanted a very small bag to bring with me to meetings or coffee shops where I only needed my iPad and a few other sundries. 11pm is not a great time to make <em>decisions</em>, so I clicked the order button before I checked measurements, and was sad when I realized it didn't actually fit my 9.7&rdquo; iPad. Luckily, I was already flying to San Francisco a week later, and was able to exchange it for the <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/products/waist-bag-black">Waist Bag</a>, after trying it on in the store. (An aside: the guy at DSPTCH was super nice, and really helpful, which further won me over. I think they have lots of great stuff, so even if this bag is too small for you, check it out.)</p>
<p>TL;DR this bag is fantastic for exactly what I bought it for—carrying an iPad and a few other things to meetings, or very short trips. A+ would buy again.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_front.jpeg" alt="Front"></p>
<h2 id="pockets-and-zips">Pockets and zips</h2>
<p>I <em>love</em> the way the pockets and zipper are laid out in this bag. The top of the bag is accessible via a single, incredibly tactile zipper pull. Seriously, this zipper pull is rad. Once unzipped, the main compartment is broken into two parts: one slightly padded iPad sleeve, and a slightly larger main area with a D-ring for keys. My 12&rdquo; MacBook <em>fits</em> in the main area, which WOW. Not much else fits in the main area if I put my laptop in here, but still, this is unbelievably cool. With an iPad, a Kindle Oasis, a rolled-up shirt, a pair of underwear, keys, and toiletries this compartment is pretty tightly packed, but the zipper is sufficiently robust (it's a big YKK), so I don't feel worried about it failing.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_main.jpeg" alt="Main"></p>
<p>The front of the bag is a flap with two super cool magnetic <a href="http://www.fidlock.com/en/fasteners/snap.html">Fidlock®</a> snaps. Pulling down slightly on each side reveals two slightly baggy pockets with elastic at the top. These pockets both have a vertical separation between the front and back of the pocket. I can fit a <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-13000-c/A1216011">USB-C battery pack</a> and cables, plus some headphones on one side, and a <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">Hobonichi Techo</a>, a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Charcoal-Black-Fine-Nib/pd/5075?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImKKypcvt3QIVhWB-Ch2pAQarEAQYAiABEgKbO_D_BwE">Lamy Safari</a>, and keycards, lip balm, and essential oil in the other. I've also fit a Kindle Oasis in one of the pockets, but it was a tight fit, and I prefer keeping it in the main bag pocket. The ease of popping open the snaps after pulling the bag around to the front reminds me why I loved messenger bags back in the day. It's super cool. I love having all of my stuff easily-accessible, but I'm also glad my load ends up light enough not to hurt my shoulder. More on that later.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_pockets.jpeg" alt="Pockets"></p>
<h2 id="material">Material</h2>
<p>The DSPTCH site says this bag is 1680D Ballistic Nylon with DWR coating, lined with 410D Nylon Packcloth with DWR coating. I haven't tested this bag in the rain yet, but the zip isn't seam-sealed, so while I'd trust it in a light rain, I wouldn't swim with it. I bring a dry bag with me everywhere for toiletries though, and it's sufficiently large I could put the bag in it in a pinch, so I'm not too worried. The material feels very nice, and high-quality, and the stitching and construction inspires confidence. The zipper pull is lightly textured on both sides, as well as contoured for a thumb and forefinger such that every use of it makes me smile.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_zip.jpeg" alt="Main"></p>
<p>This is a bag you will want to open and close. The Fidlock® snaps are similarly fun to use. The strap is pretty solid as well, and my only complaint is that I wish the clasp was metal/magnetic instead of plastic, even though the plastic feels solid. This bag generally feels like it will hold up for over 10 years, and Dpstch warranties it, which gives me even more confidence as I lug it around. I'd be amiss if I didn't mention the &ldquo;high air flow back mesh for longer periods of wear,&rdquo; which means I don't end up with <em>as much</em> sweat on my back when I'm walking around in over environments &gt;20˚.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/wb_back.jpeg" alt="Back"></p>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>This is a <em>small</em> bag. You can wear it over the shoulder, as a cross body, either in front or on your back, or as a fanny-pack/waist bag as the name indicates. In inches, it measures at 8L, or 13&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; x 1.5&rdquo; at 1.1lbs, but the numbers belie how much it can carry. This is the kind of bag your friends say &ldquo;wow&rdquo; to as you slide out a 9.7&rdquo; iPad or 12&rdquo; MacBook. This bag fits really well on the floor under a seat on a plane without compromising foot space. It also feels great to walk in a crowd or get onto a crowded train knowing I won't bonk anyone with this bag, as it barely sticks out from my back. It's very easy to adjust the strap that goes around my chest as well, and it's easy to slide this bag around to the front when I need to pull something out. I've occasionally worn this bag on my hip/butt as a fanny-pack, and while I think it looks a little silly, it's very comfortable—your mileage may vary on style/feel.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Overall, I love this bag, and look for every opportunity to bring it with me. In my effort to downsize and travel lightly, I've found this to be a perfect companion. Every interaction I have with this bag feels great, and makes me smile. If you need something small to bring a few things to your next meeting, concert, or short trip, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.dsptch.com/products/waist-bag-black">DSPTCH Waist Bag</a>. It's <em>seriously good</em> and my suspicion is the rest of their gear is equally great.</p>

      <description>Books State Tectonics — Malka Older
A fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn&#39;t love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.</description>

<p><strong>State Tectonics</strong> — Malka Older</p>
<p>A fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn't love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience Store Woman</strong> — Sayaka Murata <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>Wow. This book was a lot more bizarre than I expected based on the recommendations I'd read—more Abe than H. Murakami. I loved the narrator, and the rich descriptions of convenience store life. This book was hilarious and wild. One of my favorites this year.</p>
<p><strong>Would You Rather</strong> — Katie Heaney</p>
<p>A touching memoir of coming-out and learning that past dating disinterest was just latent sapphism, lol. There's a lot to love about this book, and also quite a bit of cringe. It's a coming-of-age in a way, and overall I'd recommend it to young dykes and old, or anyone wondering if their sexuality is &ldquo;real&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Worth the Wait</strong> — Karelia Stetz-Waters <a href="les">*</a></p>
<p>This was a corny AF lesbian romance. Lots of random sex, and a main plot of &ldquo;the cute femme can't come out bc reasons&rdquo;. Nothing groundbreaking, but it was an easy read.</p>
<p><strong>Record of a Spaceborn Few</strong> — Becky Chambers</p>
<p>This was a much slower-paced book than the previous two, and was largely a slice of life about Exodans—the humans who left Earth to take their chances in the universe after Earth became uninhabitable. I enjoyed the various characters, the queer relationships, and the color added to this way of life. Sometimes it's nice to have a space scifi book that isn't full of lasers and danger.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>A Simple Favor</strong></p>
<p>What a silly, fun movie. It ends up in kind of a weird, messy state by the end, as if Feig is like &ldquo;wait, what if they don't remember I made Bridesmaids?!?&quot;, but I generally enjoyed seeing Blake Lively be a cool babe, while Anna Kendrick does her thing. All the side-characters were fun, and even though it felt long, it was also consistently enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>Blindspotting</strong></p>
<p>This is the third movie I've seen this year that was shot in Oakland, and I loved it. There is so much intensity, and so many parts that made me hold my breath, but everyone in this, especially Daveed Diggs, just showed-up and did an outstanding job. The criticism of gentrification in this felt more present and painful than Sorry to Bother You, and the raw emotional energy between family and friends here was so good.</p>
<p><strong>The Nun</strong></p>
<p>Lol, this ridiculous series. My friend got me into this while I was recovering from a surgery last year by asking me to watch all the preceding movies before we went to see one of the Annabelle ones. This series delivers spooky times, jump-scares, and a universe completely devoid of a loving god. I'm always down for a movie where the evil folks win, and this series is suitably unclear about who actually comes out on top, so I just claim it for the demons.</p>
<p><strong>The Endless</strong></p>
<p>What a bizarre, fantastic film. I loved the world and magic of this movie, as well as the general sense of eerie inevitably. I'm excited to see the previous film as well. The shots of this film are a mix of dutch angles, handheld, and some neat CGI. There's quite a bit of upsetting stuff in this film, but it's also a fun ride.</p>
<p><strong>47 Meters Down</strong></p>
<p>Mandy Moore has never scuba-dived, but on a vacation to Mexico, her asshole friend convinces her to scuba in a cage with sharks to forget a man. It goes about as poorly as you’d think. I loved every claustrophobic minute of this. Fuck the ocean, I’m sticking to the rivers and the lakes that I’m used to.</p>
<p><strong>Mary and the Witch's Flower</strong></p>
<p>A cute anime about a young girl who stumbles into the world of witchcraft. Very reminiscent of Howl's Moving Castle, but with a less encompassing world.</p>

      <description>In my previous post, I talked about anticipating XOXO 2018, which ended last night. Today, I am tired, happy, and trying to remember what to do for work when I&#39;m not awkwardly wandering around a stadium full of 2000+ people.
So. Many. People. This year I was overwhelmed by the size of XOXO in ways I hadn&#39;t been in the past. To be fair, two years ago I was only a year into working from home, whereas now I&#39;m 3 years a hermit, but still, 2000 people is a lot.</description>

To be fair, two years ago I was only a year into working from home, whereas now I'm 3 years a hermit, but still, 2000 people is a <em>lot</em>. It felt like 100-200 people were folks I either knew from Twitter, friends, or Slack, and the &ldquo;should I wave or say hi?&rdquo; feeling that keeps me from going to parties was <em>hugely</em> amplified here. Fortunately, there were good talks, and things that weren't socially awkward to attend. Also, as always, having a friend or two around is a good salve fo my anxiety, and leaving the venue often to eat was vital.</p>
<h2 id="cool-stuff">Cool stuff.</h2>
<p>The games were neat. I only played Plunge, but watching Neo Cab, and untitled goose game was fun. Also, Laura Hall's very good ARG was silly good, with a chill payoff at the end. I felt lucky to do it early, before the 60+ person line after the Andys announced its existence on stage. Open Mike Eagle, Demi, and Janelle Shane gave particularly fun talks. I often felt like the bird in a psychological experiment that dies between two equidistant food bowls, but often just gave-in and stayed at the same thing for a while to avoid zipping to-and-fro.</p>
<p>The friends I caught up with were a huge highlight, especially folks I got to eat with and wander around with. It's really helpful to have a small crew that are a known quantity, so when I was out of energy, I knew what to expect. I hosted two friends this time as well, and coming home with them was like returning home with some family. I made the choice more than once to eschew an activity for some time with a few people, and that felt very rewarding.</p>
<h2 id="next-year">Next year</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I hope the size of XOXO goes down again next year.
If this means more sponsorship, community funding, and other methods for a quarter -&gt; half of the attendees to not pay for a ticket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also hope that there is a little less parallel programming that isn't recorded.
Needing to use the restroom, take a break, or eat food often felt like a frustrating trade-off with wanting to see a friend talk or perform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karaoke was good, but the very talented musicians who performed drastically altered the room.
Next year, more than one karaoke room could be rad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved the free soda, but paid alcohol system, especially because it discouraged heavy drinking, I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bathrooms were about what I expected for a stadium, but I hope next year they're a little less brutalist/low-ceilinged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't know if Revolution Hall is a better venue, but I definitely missed the outside yard area, because grass fields are nicer than concrete pavilions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, I don't envy the Andys any of the planning, listening, or responding they've spent years doing, and think they've put together an extremely good, complicated event. I will probably try to attend again in 2019, circumstances permitting. Community is hard. I think it's worth it.</p>

      <description>My 3rd XOXO Thinking about the next few days in Portland, I&#39;m thrilled beyond measure. So many new and old friends will be in my city, wandering around, making and showing art, and eating tons of food. When I first attended XOXO in 2015 I had no idea what to expect. I&#39;d been to SXSW for years, growing-up in Austin, but never before had I felt so surrounded by rad, like-minded people.</description>

<p>Thinking about the next few days in Portland, I'm thrilled beyond measure. So many new and old friends will be in my city, wandering around, making and showing art, and eating tons of food. When I <a href="https://medium.com/xoxo/xoxo-2b353d686df9">first attended XOXO in 2015</a> I had no idea what to expect. I'd been to SXSW for years, growing-up in Austin, but never before had I felt so surrounded by rad, like-minded people. The talks were incredible, the social hangouts were silly fun, and the love at the festival was palatable. At the risk of being too sincerely stoked, XOXO is one of the best things I've ever attended. In the year after my first XOXO, I was lucky to join the XOXO Outpost, which later became <a href="https://enthusiasmcollective.com">The Enthusiasm Collective</a>, and my office away from home. The calibre of people I've gotten to know through XOXO, not least of all, <a href="https://waxy.org">Andy Baio</a> &amp; <a href="http://goodonpaper.com">Andy McMillan</a>, is absurd.</p>
<p>Three years later, I'm gearing-up to host <a href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/haley.rose.smith/">two</a> <a href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/helen.shewolfe.tseng/">friends</a>, and see dozens more. Thursday means registration and my first chance to see Cameron Esposito live. Friday, I'll be with Haley &amp; Andy at table 13 of [Level Eater's] special XOXO edition, and then seeing Darth, Helen, and Jenn present Art + Code. Saturday means <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/friendshipping/id971362201?mt=2">Jenn &amp; Trinn</a> performing Friendshipping (not that <a href="http://www.mrm.org/friendshipping">Friendshipping</a>), and <a href="https://neocabgame.com">Neo Cab</a>. Sunday promises amazing tales from <a href="http://www.demiadejuyig.be">Demi</a> and Claire (<a href="https://clairelevans.com)">https://clairelevans.com)</a>. Finally there'll be a closing party with a surprise musical guest, and I can't wait.</p>
<h2 id="one-year-later">One Year Later</h2>
<p>Today marks the one year anniversary of my <a href="https://medium.com/@brookshelley/one-month-in-279323105fba">coolest body mod</a>. I don't have much to say beyond this being an extremely vital part of many folks lives, and a procedure that <em>absolutely</em> should be covered by medical insurance (single-payer national insurance, obviously). My quality of life has grown immensely since last September, and not being weighed-down by parts of my body have led me to deeply enjoying <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/08/14/powerlifting.html">powerlifting</a>, and getting naked in semi-public places—shout-out to hot springs &amp; weird parties. Major shout-out to my employer, <a href="https://www.turbinelabs.io">Turbine Labs</a> for being badasses who fought to ensure I'd have this coverage, and gave me a month off from work to heal. I couldn't have done it without their support.</p>
<h2 id="this-fall">This Fall</h2>
<p>If you see me at XOXO, wave and say hi. I'll also be in San Francisco a couple times in September, including at <a href="https://chaosconf.splashthat.com">Chaos Conf</a>, and later in the year at <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/attend/">KubeCon &amp; Envoy Conf</a> which promises to be better than the last Seattle KubeCon, during which a terrible man was elected to the presidency. I look forward to not sobbing uncontrollably in the Modern Art Museum and then smoking too many cigarettes this year. I don't know what else might happen before 2018 closes out, but I'm excited and have a great feeling about this Fall.</p>

      <description>Books Fingersmith — Sarah Waters
In an odd turn of fate, I&#39;d seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that&#39;s likely because I devoted little time to reading.</description>

<p><strong>Fingersmith</strong> — Sarah Waters</p>
<p>In an odd turn of fate, I'd seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so
the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean
director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but
Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the
page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that's likely because
I devoted little time to reading. I'm glad I finished this, and recommend
it if you love multi-layered, deftly-woven stories.</p>
<p><strong>Empire Ascendant</strong> — Kameron Hurley</p>
<p>A wild second installment in the Mirror Empire trilogy that is so
chock-full of characters and their (spoiler alert) doubles, that I got a
bit confused. There's a glossary and character list in the back, but dang,
this is some GoT stuff. I enjoyed the descent into chaos in this book, and
I'm eagerly anticipating the conclusion(?) in the third. Also one of the
only books I know that has a character using ze/hir pronouns, but it also
unhelpfully talks about sex as different from and perhaps less malleable
than gender, so I wouldn't call this a &ldquo;dope representation of trans
folks,&rdquo; so much as &ldquo;well there's some genderqueerness I guess&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Den of Thieves</strong></p>
<p>A heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop well. The plot was decently executed, but it's mostly just a movie with lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>Masterminds</strong></p>
<p>A ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Sudekis. It's about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality physical comedy.</p>
<p><strong>Book Club</strong></p>
<p>Watched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great?
I love Candace Bergen from the Murphy Brown
days, and hope I look as good as Diane Keaton when I'm older. Silly
popcorn fun. Also I guess I own it now because it wasn't available to rent.</p>
<p><strong>The Meg</strong></p>
<p>Wow. This is my new favorite sea-based movie. What an epically hilarious film.
A+ good job everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Impossible Fallout</strong></p>
<p>A wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I
laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I
love this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and
passionately.</p>
<p><strong>Ready Player One</strong></p>
<p>I blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch. It was just
as bad as I thought it would be, but blessedly we could make good jokes
throughout.</p>

      <description>Due to a series of forest fires, Portland has looked like an alien planet for the past few weeks.
Every day I wake up and google &amp;ldquo;air quality&amp;rdquo; to see just how much I need to stay indoors, next to my air filter. My gym has closed for a few days for two weeks, and walking outside just plain sucks.
The only cool part is the sunsets are ridiculous, and the moon is red at night.</description>

      <description>Young Brook Growing up, I never wanted to be big. My parents were both over 6&amp;rsquo; tall, and I worried about being as big as them. Most of my friends ended up being shorter than me, and were usually skinnier too. I was made fun of for being &amp;ldquo;chubby&amp;rdquo; in middle school, and that stuck with me. Being fat or chubby or skinny all rule, but I didn&#39;t know that as a kid.</description>
      <content:encoded><h2 id="young-brook">Young Brook</h2>
<p>Growing up, I never wanted to be big. My parents were both over 6&rsquo; tall, and I
worried about being as big as them. Most of my friends ended up being shorter
than me, and were usually skinnier too. I was made fun of for being &ldquo;chubby&rdquo; in
middle school, and that stuck with me. Being fat or chubby or skinny all rule,
but I didn't know that as a kid. I just thought I was broken, bc I didn't have
a flat chest or whatever the other kids did at 12. I used to worry about my
weight all the time, and no matter what I ate, or didn't eat, I kept some
love-handles. Eventually I got used to my body, and now I love it. There's a
longer story there, but generally not wanting to be &ldquo;big&rdquo; kept me away from
weights, and on a bike.</p>
<h2 id="present-day">Present day</h2>
<p>I still keep track of my weight, but on a longer time-scale, and these days,
it's less about getting down to a number, and more in line with general
health-tracking. I did yoga regularly for around three years, but I never felt
stronger, just usually more calm, which rules too. Last summer, I read
<a href="https://www.thehairpin.com/2017/08/the-myths-of-bodyweight-training/">The Myth of Bodyweight Training</a> and then a bunch of posts from Casey about powerlifting,
and thought, &ldquo;ok, I'll try this&rdquo;. I heard about <a href="http://boldandbadass.com">Bold &amp; Badass</a> from some
<a href="https://2018.xoxofest.com">XOXO</a> friends, and went in for a session. Then I
went back, and back, and back. I took off some time last year due to an
unrelated surgery, and a trip to Japan in January, but since February, I've
gone two days a week on average, with July and August being closer to three,
and four most days. It feels great, and I feel both stronger and happier while
there and on rest days. The focus and calm I found during yoga is present during
powerlifting, but I can also track progress, which I enjoy because
I'm a nerd.</p>
<h2 id="wtf-is-powerlifting">WTF is &ldquo;powerlifting&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>Simply put: bench-pressing, squatting, and deadlifting. I usually do accessory
workouts and a lot of stuff that gets my heart-rate up for cardio health, but
those three lifts are the crux of powerlifting, and in competition, the total
of the 3 weights lifted are what your'e judged on. It rules. There's so much
complexity and muscle memory involved in doing these lifts well, and it's
really helpful to have a trainer, and start very light. But, once you get the
hang of it, you end up lifting more than you would ever imagine.</p>
<h2 id="gains">Gains?</h2>
<p>I still remember my first sessions bench-pressing ~80lbs, squatting ~100lbs,
and deadlifting 65lbs (the bar + 10lbs on each side to lift it up). These days
I'm very proud to be bench-pressing 175, squatting 245, and deadlifting 345.
It's been a <em>lot</em> of work to get  to this point, but I can see the progress. My
gym is doing a summer of strength at this point, and that means a specific
linear training  regimen that means each time I lift with my arms (bench/OHP),
I add 2.5lbs, and each time I lift with my legs (squat/DL), I add 5 lbs.
Once we get to a place where we can't do a 3rd set of 5, after first trying for
a third set of 5-10 for as many weeks as possible,  we unload by 10% and start
over. It's freeing knowing what I'm  going to lift before I start each day, and
having the encouragement  of all the awesome folks in my gym as we all strive
to improve our personal numbers. Our competition is with ourselves, largely,
and that's the most fun kind, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="lifting-is-silly">Lifting is silly</h2>
<p>I want to be clear that the benefits to my mental and physical health also come
with a new type of self-aware humor about the whole thing. Gyms are weird, and
lifting heavy stuff is particularly silly. I'm lucky that a lot of my coworkers
also love powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting (clean &amp; jerks, and snatches),
so we can laugh even as we cheer each other on. Being able to enjoy things, and
laugh at/with them is super important to me. Plus, have you seen the long socks
for sumo? JK, they rule.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>If you're stoked on lifting at all, and you're in Portland, come join me at
Bold &amp; Badass, or find a body-positive gym in your area. If you read this, but
still have zero interest, then&hellip; thanks for reading?</p>

      <description>A few years ago, after moving to Portland, I discovered a secret: you can do almost anything alone. I&#39;d lived in Austin for most of my life, and as I quickly learned once moving, making friends in Portland is a long process. So, on a whim, I started seeing movies by myself. I went to dinner alone with a book. I even saw concerts&amp;hellip; solo, and it was fun. I don&#39;t know why we all think you have to do these activities with other people, but when you go alone you don&#39;t have to wait for anyone to be ready to go, or to leave.</description>

you don't have to wait for anyone to be ready to go, or to leave. There's no
coordination necessary, and if you want to talk to someone, you can always text
or use Slack. At dinner, I usually bring a book, and just relax with whatever
author I'm reading at the time. It's magical.</p>
<p>This last weekend, I went to two shows: one alone, and one with a new friend I
met in SF at Karaoke who lives in Portland—Hi Mehan.</p>
<h2 id="hop-along--thin-lips">Hop Along &amp; Thin Lips</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/photo-2.jpeg" alt="Hop along"></p>
<p>Friday was <a href="https://hopalong.bandcamp.com">Hop Along</a>, with <a href="https://xxthinlipsxx.bandcamp.com">Thin Lips</a> opening. I've never seen either of these
Philly bands before, but they were both excellent. Thin lips is a punk-y band
with a rad queer lady lead singer, who covers chosen family, dating, and
anxiety. I'd never heard of them before this show, but now they're on a regular
rotation in my headphones. Hop Along is a favorite of mine since their first
album, and Frances&rsquo; voice was incredible in person. They have a sound that's
difficult to discuss, so I hope you listen. Her voice is singular, and hella
powerful. I usually have at least one of their songs humming in my head any
given week while I grocery shop, or go on walks. I stood and danced a bit for
both of these bands, and in between, I read on my Kindle iOS app, when I
might've made small talk. There were a LOT of couples at this show, many of
them queer, which ruled. Seeing bands is kinda cool as a date, in my
experience, because how often do you get to quietly enjoy something with a
loved one?</p>
<h2 id="deafheaven">Deafheaven</h2>
<p><img src="/photos/photo.jpeg" alt="Deafheaven"></p>
<p>Sunday night, I saw <a href="https://deafheavens.bandcamp.com">Deafheaven</a>, who're kind
of &ldquo;metal for folks who don't like metal&rdquo;. They're sick, and both times I've
seen them they play and sing their hearts out. Bonus points for Geroge, the
lead singer, growing out his hipster haircut into some serious 90s metal locks.
Headbanging just works better with long hair. Hung with my friend in between
sets, and made dumb jokes. The openers weren't really my jam, but Deafheaven
put on such a wild long set, I immediately forgot about the first hour or so of
so-so music.</p>
<p>I've got a few more shows coming up this year, and I'm stoked AF to see Mitski,
especially.</p>

I don&#39;t know how often I&#39;ll post, but at least once a month, I&#39;ll do a media dietpost, which clips out what I read and watched that month from the long lists I keep.

<p><strong>Adventure Zone: There Be Gerblins</strong></p>
<p>A masterful adaptation of the podcast D&amp;D romp into a graphic novel. I
absolutely loved this. I'm not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn't
listened to the podcast, but if you haven't, get on it&hellip; it's free and
it's delightful.</p>
<p><strong>La Bastarda</strong> — Trifonia Melibea Obono <a href="#les">*</a></p>
<p>A lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman
abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself
falling for another woman. The first half was full of build-up and
world-building, but the back half felt like a very rushed piece, as though
Trifonia was hoping to get it all out in a final effort. I enjoyed this
book, but the bits that were glossed over about Okomo's journeys, her
grandfather's death, and other scenes could've been fleshed-out.</p>
<p><strong>Blackfish City</strong> — Sam J. Miller <a href="#ghost">**</a></p>
<p>This book ruled, and I was super surprised at how much I loved it.
Absolutely riveting, and a blast. The individual characters felt very
distict, and were easy to follow, and the world felt really interesting.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Drive Angry</strong></p>
<p>There are probably worse Nic Cage movies, but this is the worst one I've
seen. Every scene is painfully bad.</p>
<p><strong>Tomb Raider</strong></p>
<p>Fun, and very surprisingly entertaining for a video game movie. Lots of
&ldquo;oh, I could see how this would play in the game,&rdquo; scenes. Alicia Vikander
is a much better Lara Croft too, imo.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry to Bother You</strong></p>
<p>This is the movie Idiocracy wishes it were. Sorry to Bother You skewers
tech culture, bay-area poverty, racial injustice, and so much more.
Throughout, Tessa, Lakeith, and the rest of the cast deliver awesome
performances. A mix of chilling and laugh-inducing. One of the best films
I've seen this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tragedy Girls</strong></p>
<p>What a wild, fucked-up movie about social media, murder, and friendship.
Don't do it for the gram.</p>
<p><strong>I, Tonya</strong></p>
<p>Finally watched this with a friend, and wow, it was good but full of very
violent abuse stuff. Growing up in the 80s/90s, Tonya Harding was in a lot
of news, but this definitely filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of her
story.</p>
<p><strong>Villainess</strong></p>
<p>What a wonderfully bonkers movie. It kicks off with wild first-person murder
fest, and just goes off-the-rails from there. One of the bloodier and wilder
action films I've seen in a long time. Loved it.</p>
<p><strong>The Incredibles 2</strong></p>
<p>Watched this a few hours after the first one. The animation has gotten a LOT
better, even though the first one honestly aged pretty well, since they didn't
try to make it photorealistic. The plot was ridiculous again, and they
definitely leaned hard into the &ldquo;men are bad at childcare&rdquo; shit that I
suspected they would. Fun enough though anyways.</p>
<p><strong>The Incredibles</strong></p>
<p>The animation holds up surprisingly well for a few year-old movie, even if
the plot depends on some pretty annoying misogynist tropes. I watched this
to prep for the new movie, and overall it was a fun, if ridiculous, movie.</p>
<p><strong>Ant Man &amp; the Wasp</strong></p>
<p>This was a hoot. Very silly, and pretty PG, but above all else, this felt
like a comic movie. I'd compare this to Spiderman Homecoming or a less
stylish Thor Ragnarok. Great summer night movie.</p>
<p><strong>Sicario</strong></p>
<p>What a wild movie, in which I needed to completely suspend all of my
feelings about America, the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; and Thanos. If you can attempt to
not emotionally connect to the actual monsters in this movie, it's kinda
fun in a &ldquo;tense film where things blow up&rdquo; kind of way.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>
<p>Lesbian murder mystery? Yes. This was fun, even if the music felt super
weird at times. Good bangs. Cool cars. A movie where men are the worst.
Also this seems consistent with the choices and habits of geminis, so, lol.
<em>shots fired</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</strong></p>
<p>Lol, this movie was absurd. They rushed off the island and so many of the
subplots never really paid off? I can't forget that Pratt is a
conservative, and I didn't really care much about anyone in this film,
except for the dinosaurs. I guess I was rooting for the dinosaurs, and I
figure they probably came out ahead.</p>

      <description>Books Swearing Off Stars — Danielle Wong
Started off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common &amp;ldquo;I can&#39;t really be with you until it&#39;s too late&amp;rdquo; lesbian novel. I also kept thinking an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was an odd read, and the time-jumps didn&#39;t help. If you can write a lesbian romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying?</description>

<p><strong>Swearing Off Stars</strong> — Danielle Wong</p>
<p>Started off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common &ldquo;I can't
really be with you until it's too late&rdquo; lesbian novel. I also kept thinking
an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was
an odd read, and the time-jumps didn't help. If you can write a lesbian
romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying?
Super annoying. It was a pretty quick read at least. Read for a lesbian
book club.</p>
<p><strong>Little Fish</strong> — Casey Plett</p>
<p>Outstanding and devastating. This is a book full of people I've known,</p>
<p>slept with, and smiled at across the room. Family is a tenuous thing, and
Little Fish finds space for it throughout. I'm not sure what I would've
made with this years ago, but now, it's a sad and good ache. I hope Casey
keeps writing, and sharing her work with us for years to come. I read this
in one go, and it was a wild ride that had me laughing and crying.</p>
<p><strong>Paprika</strong> — Yasutaka Tsutsui</p>
<p>A fantastically bizarre story of science, dreams, desire, and the smallness
of men. I'd seen the anime adapted from this book years ago, so I had some
predisposition towards envisioning characters a certain way, but this book
goes to way different places than I remember the movie going. I liked this
quite a bit, save for the weird shit with sexual assault. Like many books
written by a guy, it shows.</p>
<p><strong>Infidel</strong> — Kameron Hurley</p>
<p>Really loving this series about a tough AF bounty hunter lady named Nyx.
The world-building is pretty interesting, and the story moves forward at a pretty good clip. All-told, this is a fun sci-fi action novel.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Solo</strong></p>
<p>This was probably tied with Last Jedi for my least favorite of the new Star
Wars, but I liked it better than pretty much any of the old or prequel
ones. It was fun, had a few rad women, and didn't go overboard on &ldquo;remember
this?&rdquo; fanservice. I laughed a few times, and I'm hoping they make sequels.</p>
<p><strong>Appropriate Behavior</strong></p>
<p>This was a fun movie about being a Persian Bisexual woman in NYC. Shirin
goes through a major breakup, then struggles to date, and heal, while
dealing with a family she doesn't think will understand her queerness, and
the strange world of the NYC queer and poly scene. I laughed out loud
during a lot of this, even as I scratched my head at the confusing
references to trans guys—like, why are they a joke? Overall, I dug this
movie, and hope the director/writer Desiree makes more films soon.</p>
<p><strong>Red Sparrow</strong></p>
<p>I will never believe for one second that the protagonist would fall for Joel
Edgerton's bland spyman. For some reason, I expected this movie to be set
during the cold war, but instead it's vaguely now. This had more sexual
assault than I expected too, which is a fucking bummer. The saving grace in
this film is that by and large Jennifer Lawrence kills or beats all the men
in the movie. I can only hope she gets cast in more movies where she
doesn't have to participate in misogynist porn first.</p>
<p><strong>Unlocked</strong></p>
<p>I'm a sucker for middling spy movies, and Noomi Rapace, so I now own this
film. It wasn't great, but it was fun, and dammit, sometimes that's all I
need. TIL Michael Douglas is still around.</p>
<p><strong>xx</strong></p>
<p>Terrible title unless everyone involved had to get a karyotype test to be
involved. Most of the horror was related to having kids, which meant this
movie hit me hard, because kids are the worst and deeply frightening on the
best days.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean's 8</strong></p>
<p>All. Ladies. Heist. A+. I hope everyone involved in this comes out as gay.
Points for literally every outfit, and double points for Rhianna's
devil-may-care overalls, and Cate Blanchett's Carol-as-a-Timelord character.</p>
<p><strong>Oh Lucy!</strong></p>
<p>This movie ruled! The world feels pretty rough these days, and this movie
doesn't shy away from difficult topics, but the overarching feeling of Oh
Lucy is a kind and happy one. It was also cool seeing an actor I've watched
in lots of Kiyoshi Kurasawa films show up in a very rad role.</p>

      <description>Books Lab Rat One — Andrea Höst
Ok, this series is exceedingly straight, and that&#39;s a bummer. I wish there was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I&#39;ve gotten slightly sick of the cycles of &amp;ldquo;power then injury&amp;rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I&#39;m going to finish this out.

<p><strong>Lab Rat One</strong> — Andrea Höst</p>
<p>Ok, this series is exceedingly straight, and that's a bummer. I wish there
was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues
to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I've gotten slightly
sick of the cycles of &ldquo;power then injury&rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I'm
going to finish this out.</p>
<p><strong>Caszandra</strong> — Andrea Höst</p>
<p>Ugh, I wanted to enjoy the rest of this story, but this book was so
exceedingly dull. I <strong>loathe</strong> that the main character was setup to not
only get married, but have kids at ~19 years old. Fuck that. This series
started off well, but ended up being even worse than Twilight. Read the
first book, and skip the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Space Opera</strong> — Catherynne M. Valente</p>
<p>Uproariously fun, and silly throughout. Take Douglas Adams, add in some
queerness, and an obsession with Eurovision. Loved this from start to
finish. I devoured the back-half of this book in one sitting at a cafe in
Copenhagen, and found myself crying in the afterword/credits.</p>
<p><strong>Gold, Fame, Citris</strong> — Claire Vaye Watkins</p>
<p>Interesting book about a post-apocalyptic wasteland America and the ideas
of survival and family. I enjoyed this.</p>
<p><strong>Gods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach</strong> — Kelly Robson</p>
<p>A cool scifi short novel where the future is barren, but at least there's
time-travel. I wanted more world-building, and probably a couple more books
in this story, but that also means I liked this book quite a bit. The back
half of the book felt much faster than the lead-up, and much of the action
was compacted, but it was a fun adventure. This is a solid addition to the
burgeoning eco-scifi genre.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>Geostorm</strong></p>
<p>A trash movie in the best way. If you liked watching Jake Gylenhall run
from ice in The Day After Tomorrow, and people saying &ldquo;zap!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;geostorm!&quot;, then this movie is for you. Continues the trend of big-budget
action films being largely targeted for non-US success, but that means we
also get some cool co-stars.</p>
<p><strong>In the Fade</strong></p>
<p>One of the saddest movies I've seen in a long time. It's gorgeous,
well-shot, and soundtracked, but phew, what a brutal movie about the evils
of nazism, and racism.</p>
<p><strong>Avengers: Infinity War</strong></p>
<p>This movie tried to tie together too many disparate stories, to bland
effect. The attempt at some sort of emotional climax was a big wet fart,
despite ten people in the theater I was in yelling at the screen. Like,
<em>spoilers</em> they'll all be back, bc Disney isn't going to kill off their
money-makers. Go rewatch Black Panther of Thor Ragnarok, or like, spend 3
hours outside instead.</p>
<p><strong>Deadpool 2</strong></p>
<p>As fun as Avengers: Infinity War was boring and meh. Full of silly jokes.
There were definitely jokes that were in really poor taste, but pretty
much what I expected.</p>

      <description>Bags are my thing. Well, bags and shoes. Traveling as much as I do, having a dependable, comfortable, and sleek bag is pretty important. For the past two or so years, I&#39;ve depended on my Topo Designs Trip Pack for short trips, and then nested it inside of my Ryu QuickPack for longer trips abroad. This has worked out well, but walking around Copenhagen, and going through a variety of international airport security, I wondered if I could consolidate to one bag, with an easier way to access my laptop and other stuff.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Bags are my thing. Well, bags and shoes. Traveling as much as I do, having a dependable, comfortable, and sleek bag is pretty important. For the past two or so years, I've depended on my Topo Designs Trip Pack for short trips, and then nested it inside of my Ryu QuickPack for longer trips abroad. This has worked out well, but walking around Copenhagen, and going through a variety of international airport security, I wondered if I could consolidate to one bag, with an easier way to access my laptop and other stuff. The <a href="https://www.opposethis.com/products/invisible-backpack-one-mini">Invisible One Mini</a> seemed like a great way to test this out. I was drawn to the design of the bag, and the ethos of the company: &ldquo;Each year we reiterate and improve our designs&hellip;&rdquo; which I've witnessed as I've watched them iterate over the years.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/oneminifront.jpeg" alt="One Mini photo"></p>
<h2 id="pockets-and-zips">Pockets and zips</h2>
<p>My Topo Designs Trip Pack has three compartments—a main area where I can slip my laptop, a zip pouch in that main area, and a front pocket for a Kindle, notebook, etc. I found myself digging around more than I wanted to for my charger, pen, or chapstick. The Invisible One Mini has just a little more organization, and so far, it's made a huge difference.</p>
<p>The 2018 One Mini has a zipper pocket in the front, that's charmingly asymmetrical. A flap unzips, revealing a pocket that can hold an iPad or Kindle, a zipper-sealable area for keys, chapstick, glasses cloth, etc, and two smaller pouches. These pouches are the perfect size for a portable battery, and a Hobonichi Techo. There's a bit of additional space in the big zipper area for my MacBook charger as well. The entire big pouch is almost the width and heigh of the bag, but because of the clever organization, it doesn't feel like I'll lose things in it.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/oneminipocket.jpeg" alt="One Mini pocket"></p>
<p>On the top of the bag, there's a big zipper that opens the main compartment, which I use to hold a hoodie, my water bottle, and also a small bag of underwear and clothes for travel. Because of the front organization, I don't need to dig in this compartment often, and only need to keep a few easy-to-find or pack-to-leave unpack-at-destination items in it. This is a big improvement over the Topo Bag.</p>
<p>Finally, the back of the bag has a top-loading laptop sleeve that's soft and felt-lined. The bottom ends a bit above the bottom of the bag, providing a little cushion area, but I still wouldn't want to throw this bag around with my MacBook in it. Unlike the Ryu or the Topo Designs bags, this separate laptop area means I can dig my MacBook out on the occasions I can't get pre-check and have my laptop scanned separately. I try my damndest to avoid these instances, but inter-Europe travel usually means pulling out all my electronics.</p>
<p>Previous years of this bag had weird side zips on the front and back for the laptop, a water bottle, and documents and other stuff in the front, but this version feels more usable, and less confusing at a glance. I doubt I'll have any trouble remembering where I put various items, or how to quickly retrieve them. Read more about the year-over-year change <a href="https://www.opposethis.com/blogs/insidethis/invisible-backpack-one-2018">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-material">The material</h2>
<p>The entire bag is a light-weight 800x600D waterproof nylon-polyester blend that looks and feels pretty lux. The top handle is a rubber-ish leather-is material that's grippy and feels nice, and the inside of the pack straps is a soft and breathable cloth. The top of the bag is ringed with the same rubberized material, encircling the main compartment. The inside of the two front areas is a gray nylon that feels like smooth quality. All over the bag, the stitches are even and seem made for longevity. I'll update this review later to see how well the bag stood up to travel wear-and-tear, but so far it inspires confidence. I'm also curious how well the rain resistance does, as only the laptop sleep area has a waterproof YKK zipper, with the other two using a more standard zip. The pulls have rubber grips, with no dangling pull cords, which means they're slightly more fiddly than the RYU or the Topo bags, but once I've found the tab, the pull feels smooth.</p>
<h2 id="the-size">The size</h2>
<p>This is a small bag, but feels a good deal bigger than my tiny Topo Designs bag. Measuring 38cm x 34cm x 14cm (15&quot;x13.5&quot;x5.5&rdquo;), with a volume of 11L, and a weight of 650g (22oz), it's easy to throw on, but doesn't look dwarfed by my 5'10&rdquo; frame. It sits well on my back, and the clever straps let me cinch it up or down, while the excess strap stays tucked into itself. The main compartment is roomy enough without making the other areas of the bag feel cramped, that I feel pretty confident I could take only this bag for a few weeks abroad.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I haven't had this bag for long, but my first impressions are that this will be a major part of my travel kit. I can't wait to bring this with me to Oakland, or Japan, to see how well it fits under a seat, or loads and unloads in a crowded subway train.</p>

      <description>Books All Systems Red — Martha Wells
Pretty fun book about a &amp;ldquo;murderbot&amp;rdquo; who would rather be watching tv dramas than shooting anything. I&#39;m looking forward to the next few books.
Stray — Andrea Höst
This was recommended to me by my buddy Nick, and I&#39;d avoided it for unknown reasons. Maybe the cover was too low-budget? But, this book is really fun. I think this series kinda qualifies as YA, but the journal nature, as well as the mystery of scifi tech/magic systems got me deep into the world.</description>

<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p><strong>The Death of Stalin</strong></p>
<p>Super dark comedy. It has that abusive asshole Jeffrey Tambor, but
otherwise is full of hilariously weird old men. If you like Veep or In the
Thick of It, this is a must-watch.</p>
<p><strong>The Ritual</strong></p>
<p>A very good &ldquo;get lost in the woods&rdquo; movie. Bad things happen to unlikeable
men. A+.</p>
<p><strong>Cabin Fever</strong></p>
<p>I can't tell if this was the original, or if this was a remake, but either
way, it's nice to watch annoying and awful people fall apart. This is a
theme of the previous and next movie.</p>
<p><strong>The Descent</strong></p>
<p>Another &ldquo;maybe these are bad people&rdquo; everything-goes-wrong movie. This was
a rewatch, and yet, the cave scenes still had me feeling super
claustrophobic. It didn't help that I was in the middle of a middle row on
a plane to Portland from Amsterdam when I watched it.</p>
<p><strong>A Quiet Place</strong></p>
<p>A &ldquo;good christian family&rdquo; who <em>loves</em> gender roles has to be <em>vewwwwwy
quiet</em> so they don't get eaten by some kind of creatures. This movie was
silly as fuck. Every time the monster was on screen, someone had to
pantomime &ldquo;be quiet,&rdquo; as if the entire movie hadn't been quiet. Also
<em>spoilers</em> but how the fuck do you get pregnant if you know that a baby is
going to make loud baby noises and get your family killed? And <em>where did
they fuck?</em> Anyways, this is a hate-watch.</p>

      <description>“Daughters are as good a thing as any…” begins The Merry Spinster by Danny Ortberg’s wild reimagining of the Little Mermaid that ends in such grim fashion as to make the reader nod solemnly and intone, “truly, these are the end of times.” And yet, what a romp of a dark timeline. Unlike Texts from Jane Eyre, his first book of imagined text conversations from literary characters, this reader at least felt prepared for these fables, stories, and tall-tales through study of European folklore.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>“Daughters are as good a thing as any…” begins <em>The Merry Spinster</em> by Danny Ortberg’s wild reimagining of the Little Mermaid that ends in such grim fashion as to make the reader nod solemnly and intone, “truly, these are the end of times.” And yet, what a romp of a dark timeline. Unlike <em>Texts from Jane Eyre</em>, his first book of imagined text conversations from literary characters, this reader at least felt prepared for these fables, stories, and tall-tales through study of European folklore. Even more, each story brought a sly smile to my face as I discovered the layers of joyful twisting of stories well and lesser-known.</p>
<p>“Fear Not: An Incident Log” tells of a heavenly bureaucrat who, they assure us, “(has) never once been reprimanded for how I comport myself under the sun.” We spend the story learning of the machinations of a certain kind of supernatural world, adjacent to the typical christian god, angels, and satan. As I read this story, I laughed out loud in public, and felt a welling of joy.</p>
<p>Another tale that wormed its soft, velveteen pages into my heart was “The Rabbit” — about a boy who gives his love to a toy that may or may not be sucking the life force of the child away. It’s devilish fun. Each story in this collection has a sparkle in its eye, and just a bit of dirt on its face, as if to say, “Who, me? I couldn’t have broken the window, Ms., as I studied all day.” This is a collection for rascals, miscreants, and students of folktale who smoked behind the liberal arts building, and threw rocks at their shadow.</p>
<p>As a reader, I tore through these tales quickly, but as with any fairytale, I plan to revisit these regularly, until their devilish stories take the place of better known tellings. Ortberg surely has a gift, revealed by his early work in frightening children’s tales on The Toast, but for his sophomore publication, I can see a writer hitting his stride, and stretching his legs. I can’t wait to see what further fictions he brings us. The Merry Spinster is a triumph.</p>

      <description>I’m in two book clubs. I read all the time. Reading is one of my oldest and most dear loves. The relationship between books and I is personal, consistent, and powerful. So, when a social network for reading came out years ago, I was ecstatic. Maybe now I’d build more community around reading! Maybe I would get amazing recommendations, and keep track of all the books I’d read and want to read.</description>

<p>I’m in two book clubs. I read all the time. Reading is one of my oldest and most dear loves. The relationship between books and I is personal, consistent, and powerful. So, when <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">a social network for reading</a> came out years ago, I was ecstatic. Maybe now I’d build more community around reading! Maybe I would get amazing recommendations, and keep track of all the books I’d read and want to read. And, despite the awful, awful beige, I did… for a time. But slowly, Goodreads became focused on selling me books, and was purchased by Amazon. My friend’s updates became supplanted with things I might like, but the terrible beige stayed. Goodreads went from fun, to LinkedIn… for books.</p>
<p><img src="/photos/goodreads.jpg" alt="badreads"></p>
<p>Last year, I met my <a href="https://www.haleyfiege.fun">friend Haley</a> on a Slack group, and learned that she kept track of her reading on <a href="https://haleyfiege.tumblr.com">a Tumblr page </a>— complete with little reviews. I avidly read Nick’s blog of his current reads. I barely open Goodreads unless I’m updating my page count. It’s become a less joyful network. So, I thought perhaps I would also keep my own book blog, and finally bought <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com">brookshelley.com</a></p>
<p>I decided to build off of my Github.io page, working with Markdown on Jekyll, both to play with Jekyll for work, and also to get something ready quickly that I can update by pushing commits to Github. It works! It’s easy. And I don’t have to visit somewhere beige to update it. I miss seeing my friend’s book updates, but in general it’s a far superior situation for me. I hated arbitrarily choosing a 5 star rating, so now I can say yea or neigh, but more importantly I can talk about them as much or a little as I want. I don’t have to worry about my blog selling to someone else… and even if Github doesn’t exist anymore, I’ve got the markdown files.</p>
<p>Running your own site isn’t for everyone, but I’ve been really happy being away from Goodreads. It’s pretty easy to start writing stuff in Markdown, and if you’re a tech person, Jekyll is a breeze to install, or you can just let Github handle it like I did.</p>

<p>A time and a place I wasn’t part of, but read about eagerly. The drugs, the fucking, and the sisterhood that I dreamed of from my bed in Texas. I wouldn’t have been accepted, I know, because of who I am. At the time, I was closeted, and scared. At the time I was falling for my straight friends, and stealing clothes to feel a little more whole. The music that got me through was Tori, Ani, PJ. I didn’t know enough about your books, but now when I read them, I feel a pang of nostalgia for a time I missed — for something that can only exist as a perfect picture of a time gone by. I would have gotten so fucked up. I like to think that if I existed then I would have partied with you. I like to think that somehow I could get around the politics of exclusion that were so often a part of your world. The fashion of that time is back, and when I wear my docs with a short skirt, I think, there’s still time. Valencia isn’t the same as it was, but I still roam that street, getting tattooed and kissing so many girls.</p>
<p>I flag every day. I see other dykes, and wink. I pick girls up, and make sure gloves are in my bag. My transsexuality is not a debt I owe anyone — it’s a deep felt bank of energy and power. I teach and learn from other women, and in this way, I join a line of sisterhood that ties back to yours.</p>
<p>The dykes I know don’t always know of their elders, their roots in culture. They fuck, write, and dance to the tunes and the works of your peers. Our youths are all fleeting, but we live them forever through the words we speak and put down to paper.</p>
<p>My 30s are a chance to relive my 20s — back then I couldn’t live the way I needed to, and I felt so alone. Now I fly around the world and revel in my dyke magic. We learned from you — we learned that so many of the drugs and smokes you took are anathema to us now. We live in fear of tomorrow, but also in the hope that we might have one. Our crisis is global, where yours was personal. We fight for the trans women of color, the sex workers, the women that are murdered every day, and you fought for space, and against a disease that seemed to kill everyone it touched.</p>

Jump on the back, she gives it a rev, don’t think she’s gonna top you, cos she’s belly up in bed.” — Tribe 8</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Except, I’m not. At least not every time. I top, and am topped. My gender and my sex are both more expansive than the binaries of top/bottom. I am a switch. a Dyke that loves to be inside and for you to be inside. A fist fills me up, and it says “you exist.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know about Riot Grrl until after it had shifted, become something else. I saw Kathleen Hanna speak recently, and she said “we need to do something better, we need to make sure that when we say ‘all girls to the front, we mean PoC, we mean trans women.’”</p>

<h1 id="i-do--bikini-kill">I do” — Bikini Kill</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>The trans men I know are often from your time — they learned and grew, and at times they feel like big brothers. I learn the secrets, the handshakes from them. They introduce me to the heroes I would have if I had heroes. They made space for themselves, and didn’t make space for us, but I don’t really blame them. We are all fighting for ourselves at the end of the day, and for my brothers, I often think they just wanted to live another day, more comfortable than the day before. Maybe we deserve some comfort, but I don’t know if we deserve community. Community comes from shared experience, yes, but mostly it comes from fighting, fucking, and talking together. It’s hard won, it’s built on pain and history. We can build a new community that takes the best of your past, and the best of mine, and opens its doors for all of our loves, all our trans siblings.</p>
<p>Stealth is a word we both roll our eyes at. We know why folks do it, and safety is a real problem, but to get rid of our histories? to hide from our pasts? Instead we hope to embrace ourselves as a whole, and remember even the bad times. It’s harder, and it hurts, but we grow so much more than if we pretended we were born whole-cloth, that the desperate times, grasping for the truth, had never occured.</p>

      <content:encoded><p>no cis men, says the sign on the door

are you woman enough to enter this building

the feeling that these spaces want to spit us out

because it follows us in
and comes out through their eyes</p>
<p>do you see me?
do you see what I am trying to do?
who i am, and what i am
am i more to you than a token
or just a tragic figure
am i someone you could fuck
someone you could fall in love with
can i come to your party and feel at home?</p>
<p>they check my id and find the F
the sign they look for to say “you’re good”
but i see the glint of doubt in your eyes
when i say thanks and my voice sounds
just a little too deep
the foot to head look they give
doesn’t read as checking me out
so much as vetting my existence
i feel a shiver of fear, and swallow it down</p>
<p>i dance and flirt as armor against the other
this belonging feels like a battle
and i am not one to give up easy</p>

      <description>Why I choose to travel with a 16L bag everywhere I go.
The Past Years ago, I stopped checking bags when I flew. I’d seen too many things get lost over the years, my own and other’s, and couldn’t stomach the thought of landing somewhere again, only to lose all my possessions. So, I began using a canvas duffel bag, as well as a small backpack.
The bag is grey, and around 30L in volume, has little toggle closures, and a couple internal pockets.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Why I choose to travel with a 16L bag everywhere I go.</p>
<h2 id="the-past">The Past</h2>
<p>Years ago, I stopped checking bags when I flew. I’d seen too many things get lost over the years, my own and other’s, and couldn’t stomach the thought of landing somewhere again, only to lose all my possessions. So, I began using a canvas duffel bag, as well as a small backpack.</p>
<p>The bag is grey, and around 30L in volume, has little toggle closures, and a couple internal pockets. It was great for trips in the car to Dallas to see my partner at the time’s family, or anywhere that I didn’t need to carry it. But it was horrible for planes and walking.</p>
<p>For a while, I just dealt with the shoulder pain and annoyance of a single, cross-chest strap full of gear, in addition to my backpack. But it hurt, and I didn’t really like the way I looked, carrying two different bags. I still felt much better about my setup than I would with a large rectangle of soon-to-be-lost gear, but I wanted to simplify more.</p>
<p><em>A note on my able-bodied privilege</em> This choice to carry a smaller bag, regardless of weight, is one that I was able to make because of my body. For those with chronic pain, or difficulty carrying weight on their back for whatever reason, my setup will likely not work. I see a lot of folks get frustrated with rolling bags, and I have shared that sentiment in the past, but it is very shitty to the folks who need those bags for any reason.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-your-gear">Simplify your gear</h2>
<p><em>Pack lighter by packing less</em></p>
<h3 id="clothing">Clothing</h3>
<p>The first thing I did to simplify, was to see what I could live without. Many of the <em>extras</em> that I was sure of needing got tossed. No more extra shoes for a trip. No more than the number of underwear I would need for the trip (and often less — it’s easy to hand-wash). Two bras (<strong>Nude label</strong>). A couple shirts that could also be hand-washed easily (yoga tank-tops from <strong>Lucy</strong>). Wool socks, usually two pairs. With my wardrobe thus whittled, I turned to my love of books.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>In the past I always brought at least 3 books with me on trip of more than 3 or 4 days, as I’d likely go through all of them. Books are heavy. Like, really heavy, and not very easy to pack tightly, especially if they’re lengthy. A <strong>Kindle</strong> helped fix that problem immediately. I bought the cheapest one, with ads, and loaded it up with a few books I’d acquired over the years, and some free ones from Project Gutenberg. I don’t like giving my money to Amazon, but there are other ways to buy books that support independent bookstores. Now I could carry as many books as I wanted, and acquire new ones instantly, without needing to add to the weight of my pack. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the smell and feel of books, and have a library at home that I treasure, but just like my other stuff, I don’t need to travel with everything I care about.</p>
<h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3>
<p>When it came to electronics, I was already pretty lightweight. I had the ability to afford a <strong>Macbook Air</strong>, and learned that each year I could sell the previous one and buy a new one for ~100 dollars or so if I kept it from getting banged up. This 13&rdquo;, slim laptop could go most anywhere with me with a minimal strain on my back. I had a slender <strong>Tom Bhin</strong> sleeve for it, and its charger. I also had my <strong>iPhone</strong>, my Kindle (as mentioned above), and a small USB cable for both. In recent years, I’ve switched to the <strong>Macbook</strong>, which is even smaller and lighter than the Air. My company bought me a Kindle Paperwhite, so now I can read on dark planes with minimal disturbance. I also purchased an <strong>Anker</strong> powercore 15600 that can charge my phone ~6 times before needing to be charged itself. It’s a little heavy, but has made a huge difference in how I travel, as I don’t need to worry as much about finding an outlet when I am sure to need directions and contact with folks via Twitter, email, or text. For headphones, I’ve always loved in-ear ones, but on long flights, they are painful at best. I got a pair of **ATH-M40Xs **that I adore, and usually wear them around my neck when I’m not listening to them on trips. When I get where I am traveling, I often leave them in the room and switch to my <strong>RHA 10Ti</strong> in-ear-monitors. There are better headphones for the price, but these work well for me, and most-importantly, fit into my phone while the case is on it, unlike my <strong>Shure 215k</strong> that I previously wore everywhere.</p>
<p>The final electronic device I bring is a vibrator. At home, I have quite the array, and particularly love my wireless <strong>Magic Wand</strong>. But, taking a note from a friend about not becoming dependent on what amounts to a power tool, I travel with the easily-packed <strong>JimmyJane Form 2</strong>. It does the trick, has a travel mode (so it doesn’t vibrate in my bag), and is waterproof to boot.</p>
<h3 id="other-clothes">Other clothes</h3>
<p>When I go anywhere with either changeable temperature, or the likelihood of rain, I bring my <a href="http://www.ilsejacobsen.com/womens-raincoat-RAIN50.html?c=76695">**Ilse Jacobsen Raincoat 50</a> **jacket. It’s black, minimally adorned, and waterproof. I love it. Before I had this jacket, I always brought my older <strong>Marmot Precip</strong>, which could be stowed in my bag easily, unlike this new jacket. With warmer weather, I will probably return to that jacket, for ease of carry.</p>
<p>Yoga pants are the best. For both comfort on the plane, and versatile city exploring, I always bring a pair of yoga leggings that are black, and durable. The ones I have now are from Lucy, but anything will do. With these, my socks, and the yoga tanks I wear, the key is wicking. I sweat easily, and don’t always have a great way to wash clothes, so having clothing that stays pretty stink-free, and dry, is a huge plus. It also packs down really easily due to the thinness of the fabric. You might want something a little thicker if you get cold more easily. Sometimes I bring wool tights too, to wear under these or my jeans.</p>
<p>For pants, I also bring a pair of high-waisted, stretchy black jeans. This is a style choice, but I love them. I pack these in my bag while flying, and then wear them around half the time I’m on my trip. I also bring a small pair of shorts (<strong>Foxers</strong>), for sleeping and wandering around my hotel, or hostel.</p>
<h3 id="toiletries">Toiletries</h3>
<p>I don’t wear much makeup, and that means my toiletry packing is pretty straightforward. I bring a stick of eyeliner, a stick of lipstain, some coconut-oil deodorant, essential oil, and a toothbrush. I pack these in the front pocket of my backpack, along with my medicine, and some hand-sanitizer for those times I have no idea where to wash my hands, but want to eat.</p>
<p>I also bring a water bottle, which is a <strong>Hydroflask</strong>, but have thought about getting a collapsable water bottle, the <strong>Vapur</strong>, soon. (Edit: I got a Vapor bottle, and it’s amazing. It can fold up and fit in the small front zipper of my Fjalraven bag along with the makeup and pill-bottle I keep in there. A+)</p>
<h3 id="the-bag">The bag</h3>
<p>I switch between two bags these days, depending on condition. If there will be a lot of rain, or I expect my bag to get jostled significantly, I bring my <strong>Mission Workshop 21L Sancturary</strong> bag. It’s super durable, and has held up to international travel and mistreatment in my often clumsy hands, and stayed strong for the past 6 years or so. In an effort to get even lighter, as well as have something cuter to walk around cities like NYC with, I picked up a <strong>Fjalraven Kånken</strong> bag. At 16L, it’s pretty small, but I can still fit all my packed gear inside. My only complaint with this bag, is that with my stuff in it, it can be difficult to get my laptop out in the TSA line. I never dealt with this problem using my Mission Workshop bag, because it has a folding top, that allows for easy access to the laptop in the back. The Fjalraven is a zipper system at the front of the bag, so I have to roll the top back with it unzipped to pull out my laptop. I’m considering cutting the bag and adding another zipper, but we’ll see. It’s less of a problem with the bag less tightly packed, so it’s likely this will just lead to me packing a little bit less each time, and that’s not so bad.</p>
<p><em>Final recommendation:</em> Years ago I read an article written by a designer who decided to travel without any clothes, save for enough underwear to get her through the trip. She loved the opportunity to hit up a thrift store and buy interesting outfits, which she would re-sell, or donate at the end of her trip. She figured she was saving hassle by not bringing extra clothes, and saving money, potentially, by not needing to check a bag. I love this idea, but as a woman who has a hard time finding well-fitting clothes (I’m 5'10, athletic, and wide-hipped), I don’t want to take that kind of risk. But, if you love shopping, have a frame that is more welcoming to thrift clothes, and feel ok with buying and getting rid of these temporary outfits, then I recommend trying her style of light packing. You might find that the short-lived nature of these clothes inspire you to make riskier or more interesting choices, and maybe even mailing a few pieces back home.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why I’ve decided to pack as light as I do, and it’s become a thing I both enjoy and find ways to challenge as I continue to travel regularly. Questioning the stuff I own, and finding a way to make cute outfits with limited options is a fun way to make the most of a limited budget, or a temporarily limited wardrobe. A lot of folks I know love to bring large bags with extra shoes, more clothes than they wear, and options for most gear. I’m glad they found what works for them, but I’m also very happy to have figured out a minimal pack that feel like I have enough for a week or two. However you decide to pack, light, heavy, or not at all, I hope you enjoy your travels, take some pictures, and breath.</p>

      <description>New York is my home for two months out of the year, but I only recently became acquainted with it. Growing up in Texas, I got the idea from my dad that NYC was some kind of devil city. He regarded it as a liberal place with people who walked too fast, and were too greedy. The first time I visited in my mid-twenties, I realized just how wrong he was.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>New York is my home for two months out of the year, but I only recently became acquainted with it. Growing up in Texas, I got the idea from my dad that NYC was some kind of devil city. He regarded it as a liberal place with people who walked too fast, and were too greedy. The first time I visited in my mid-twenties, I realized just how wrong he was.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-visit">My first visit</h3>
<p>At this point, I was liberal myself, and the city didn’t seem particularly evil to me. There were people literally EVERYWHERE, though in less quantities than Taipei and Chennai, both of which I visited before NYC. The density of any of those cities is slightly overwhelming for me, as I’m happier in a group of 2–6 people, but I learned quickly that I can put my headphones on and they disappear. To a degree, music makes the city feel like a river that I’m floating through or a strange movie set. Interactions with strangers aren’t necessary in the way that waving at folks on the street seems normal in Portland or Texas. In a way, I found the anonymity and brusqueness refreshing.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>As a food nerd, I also find the ubiquity of delicious meals incredibly appealing, though I will never get used to the constant lines and hype around restaurants who can only hope to fit a handful of people at a time, ensuring long waits. Still, I feast each time I visit my 2nd home. Often I will pick a particular cuisine, and try to find the 5 best examples of its preparation, be it ramen, izakaya food, or southern fried chicken. Food tourism is a major industry from what I can tell. Food isn’t cheap, but then neither is anything else in NYC. I budget to spend $60 a day in NYC on food alone, and many times I’ve blown right by that. I’d imagine if I lived there more regularly, I would cook more often, but the temptations of restaurants and carts is too high for me to pass up during each visit. I’ve yet to dive into the fine-dining scene, as I’m loathe to wear heels or hose, but I’ve heard great things about upscale restuarants. For now, I think I’ll stick to the sub-$10 congee bowl with youtiao.</p>
<h3 id="getting-around">Getting around</h3>
<p>A huge part of my love of the city is the transport. Many of my friends in NYC seem to avoid the subway, opting for Uber, taxis, or bicycles, but I love it. To me, trains are a pinnacle of old, cool technology. They’re dependable (largely), safe (except occasionally from scary folks), and inexpensive. Waiting on the platform, or slumped in a molded plastic seat, I have time to read books, listen to music, and contemplate hard problems at work or in life. In a city that moves so quickly, these brief pauses are my respite. Without them, I don’t think I could handle the bustle or the pace of NYC.</p>
<h3 id="memento-mori">Memento mori</h3>
<p>That said, I think the city wants us dead. The distinct sense I get from NYC is one of antagonism. The people can be ok at times, but the city itself pulses with too much, and too harsh. Not only are there actual dangers in the city, but the sheer speed at which everything is moving ensures that if you stumble emotionally, physically, or in spirit, the weight of the city-as-inexorable-movement will grind you into dust. Perhaps the industry or part of New York you encounter on a daily basis can mitigate this for a time, but by and large, NYC is hard to thrive in. High rents, cold winters, humid-as-hell summers, and complex transit — if you are thinking of visiting or moving from a sleepy locale, test the waters in a few seasons first.</p>
<h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>
<p>For myself, making friends was the most important part of enjoying my time in NYC. They ensure that I have activities in the city or in Brooklyn, as well as support and kind faces. With growing familiarity and the increased time I spend in the city, I now love it as a second home, and am excited to drop in for a few weeks at a time, to partake in the drug of NYC. And I’m equally happy to fly home, disembark from the plane, and breath in the cool, crisp air of Portland.</p>

      <description>Arrival
“This conference is GIGANTIC!” was my first thought upon arriving at Grace Hopper. This year’s attendance was around 10,000 folks, mostly women, and the largest conference besides SXSW that I’ve attended. Like many tech conferences, GHC had an invaluable app that showed a stream of comments from attendees as well as a schedule and other information. Once I signed in, I spent a lot of time networking and finding folks from out of town as my chosen track “Open-Source” was largely bereft of personally relevant content.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>Arrival</p>
<p>“This conference is GIGANTIC!” was my first thought upon arriving at Grace Hopper. This year’s attendance was around 10,000 folks, mostly women, and the largest conference besides SXSW that I’ve attended. Like many tech conferences, GHC had an invaluable app that showed a stream of comments from attendees as well as a schedule and other information. Once I signed in, I spent a lot of time networking and finding folks from out of town as my chosen track “Open-Source” was largely bereft of personally relevant content. Like most of the tracks, the content was focused around introductory ideas and concepts more suited to students just entering the tech world. GHC also boasted a huge job fair, and walking around was pleasantly surreal as it was comprised of 99% women, unlike just about any large room I’ve been in.</p>
<h3 id="panel">Panel</h3>
<p>My panel was very well received. It took place in an 500 person auditorium (super daunting), but our attendence was closer to 150. I spoke with my book’s editor Elissa Shevinsky, Ellen Spertus from Mills College (late of Google), and Dom DeGuzman from Twilio. Our topic was how to work with and around HR when you are in an oppressed or marginalized group, and despite the rather somber subject, there were laughs and later tears as our attendees came to talk to us and thank us. I was able to discuss the very important role of intersectionality when doing feminist work, and participating in diversity/inclusion discussions. I also brought to light some practical ways to include and help trans folks.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights?</h3>
<p>Two particular highlights in meeting people were Isis Anchalee, who started #ilooklikeanengineer, and Megan Smith, the CTO of America. There was also an LGBT (though I’m not sure why the G existed for a women’s conference) meetup at the convention center, and the turnout of around 80 women was heartening.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of speaking and my suspicion that the conference content wouldn’t be incredibly applicable, I only attended one day of it. From talking to my friends, it sounds like I didn’t miss anything too great. I think Grace Hopper could still become a wonderful conference, but for now it is primarily centered on hiring and introductory talks for white and asian-american cisgender heterosexual women. It’s unfortunate that both the size, and leadership of the conference preclude many sessions that would be beneficial, or smaller talks that could be more intimate and informative. I filled out feedback forms with honest content, and I hope that GHC and Anita Borg take note, and that next year is marginally better.</p>
<p>I’ll end with a quote from a woman who spoke to me tearfully after my talk: “I was so happy to be here at a conference with women, but I’m realizing just how many of us it still leaves out and doesn’t help or include.”</p>

      <description>Due to stress, the talk I am about to give usually overshadows the talks before mine. Fortunately, LWT was such a jam-packed speaker event that I was able to tune into the talks and not get eaten by nerves. There were a neat mix of 5 minute ignite talks about things like tackling systemic oppression, government tech work, and imposter syndrome. Some of these talks were similar to others I’ve heard, and the audience was so different than what I usually experience at a conference that I was a little sad we didn’t get past some of the 101 talks.</description>

Some of these talks were similar to others I’ve heard, and the audience was so different than what I usually experience at a conference that I was a little sad we didn’t get past some of the 101 talks.</p>
<p>It’s certainly possible that many of the women and other folks there were hearing about imposter syndrome or trans-inclusiveness for the first time, but I’d love to have more talks that dig into the meat of intersectional feminism in tech.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-talks">A few talks</h3>
<p>In the morning of Friday, there was a neat presentation by Diane Feinberg of Pixar on how they handle lighting and building a scene into something more than just 3D renderings.
The interview right before I spoke was with a senior Amazon employee concerning the NYTimes story, and she was able to add color and detail to both how the story turned out against the actual quotes and information given to the reporter, as well as what she’s changed since then.</p>
<p>After my talk, Edith Windsor was a particular delight, and had more than a few of us tearing up at her description of being a closeted gay woman at IBM in the 60s.</p>
<h3 id="generally">Generally</h3>
<p>I generally enjoyed the conference, but wish the compressed Friday schedule spread more evenly over Saturday and Sunday, instead of making them largely social/hackathon. I was also a little saddened to see banks so heavily represented in the recruiting area, but this is also my first NYC conference, so perhaps that is typical.</p>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>Overall, I think this is a worthwhile conference, and I am going to try to attend the SF summit as well in February.
Feel free to hit me up with any particular questions you have. They recorded the talks during a live-stream, and you can watch any them at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD-nwKUZ3LI">this link</a></p>

      <description>XOXO Fest recap
This is my first XOXO, and as with many festivals or conferences where I know I might be overwhelmed, I was a little apprehensive. It helped so much that we had Slack setup for XOXO months in advance. I met tons of rad people in and around the tech industry while I was online, and then when the XOXO started, I was prepared with a group of new and old friends.</description>

<p>This is my first XOXO, and as with many festivals or conferences where I know I might be overwhelmed, I was a little apprehensive. It helped so much that we had Slack setup for XOXO months in advance. I met tons of rad people in and around the tech industry while I was online, and then when the XOXO started, I was prepared with a group of new and old friends.</p>
<h2 id="the-talks">The Talks</h2>
<p>The festival’s talks focussed on unlikely success, and sometimes success that required perseverance against odds or antagonism. From Spike’s talk about running a comic business when everyone told her that her background wasn’t good enough to do so, to Rami Ismail bemoaning the lack of time spent ensuring that the Arabic on buildings in games and media was accurate (after teaching us how to read Arabic in 10 minutes), we were taken on a journey of positive encouragement and shared joy. Other highlights were the You Look Nice Today podcast’s live recording, and the talks by Mallory Ortberg about death and running a successful website for queer librarians and female bodybuilders (I kid), and Amit Gupta’s talk about priorities and work.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>The event was super well-planned and supported, and at any given time, there were a few activities possible, plus food and drinks. There were two longer daily breaks for dinner and lunch, and meeting and eating with new friends was strongly encouraged. The vetting process for attendees and the 1000 person limit ensured that almost anyone you chatted with was someone interesting. There were also many “lower-case f” famous people in attendance, such as John Gruber from Daring Fireball, Kathy Sierra, and Ashe Dryden.</p>
<p>The availability of tabletop games, as well as an Electric Objects art gallery, an arcade, and Instrument, and Panic’s parties kept folks moving through the city to great effect. I heard more than one person express newfound love for Portland, and my only hope is that they don’t move here and buy a house. (Confidential to some of you, please move here).</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>XOXO came off as a labor of love from the Andys, as well as a glorious way for those of us in tech, and adjacent, to learn new things about ourselves, and make positive connections to make the world just a little bit better. I feel incredibly lucky and happy to have attended, and I hope that next year I can return.</p>

      <title>On being alone</title>

      <description>A bit about this last few months.
It first hit me the night she left. The quiet. Before, there was rustling in the house, subtle signs of her presence, affection in the same space. Now, the night was too quiet, her form did not move with breath next to me. I was alone. My cats tried to fill the void. The wandered, and meowed, and looked for her in closets and cabinets — or so it seemed to me, as I projected my sadness onto them.</description>
      <content:encoded><p>A bit about this last few months.</p>
<p>It first hit me the night she left. The quiet. Before, there was rustling in the house, subtle signs of her presence, affection in the same space. Now, the night was too quiet, her form did not move with breath next to me. I was alone. My cats tried to fill the void. The wandered, and meowed, and looked for her in closets and cabinets — or so it seemed to me, as I projected my sadness onto them.</p>
<p>We were together for 6 years, and that never gets easier to say. We married. We are still, as of now, married. We are lesbians, but we didn’t start off looking like that. We both moved fast, without asking the questions that may have avoided the heartache. It’s hard to ask those questions when you’re having such a good time. When I looked at her, I saw someone that I could spend my days with — could grow old with — could sit in silence on a long journey with or excitedly discuss one of our new projects. This soured.</p>
<p>Near the end, when I looked at her, I only saw pain. I was reminded of the anguish and agony of being unloved and unattractive. I didn’t know, I would say, what I did. But it was immaterial. There wasn’t <em>one</em> thing at all, rather, there were myriad difficulties and decisions and micro-agressions that led to our parting. I thought I would be willing to work on these problems, but she spared me the need. She just moved out… while I was on a video podcast. There was the briefest acknowledgement that this would be difficult, and then, as if she’d never been there, she was out of my house.</p>
<p>She said she’d never felt attraction for me, and that she probably had never been in love. It’s impossible for me to know if this is true, or just the result of years of cohabitation and the daily chore of partnership. I fear both the aloneness this made me feel, and the gaping maw of quiet and inner-dialogue that her leaving put me into. For me, I didn’t leave the partnership in time. My recovery will be a slow one.</p>
<p>The entire breakup happened at an incredibly inopportune time after a huge number of life changes were still settling. My relationships, even outside of that one, were in turmoil and freshness. I had experienced one of the most significant experiences through coming out as a lesbian, and as a trans woman, and many of my friends didn’t call so much afterwards. I found a new community, or at least other people I could relate to, through twitter. They were spread far and wide across American and Canada, and the flight miles I will rack up visiting them are immense. I don’t know if we are on twitter because we’re all alone together, or if our shared experiences and hurts are just too much to not have the 140 character pressure-release valve. Ultimately, I don’t like to question it too much. My friends are amazing now. I feel, finally, like a person that might be ok, someday.</p>
<p>The loneliness of a breakup is a special kind of bitterness. Nothing removes that taste, that tang of regret and sadness, except time. My apartment is filled with friends on occasion, but I still need someone to also call it home. It took months for me to be ok with the idea, but I am finding a roommate. Not a lover this time, or a girlfriend, but an actual roommate. This will be my first in seven years. This was also the first time I’ve lived alone. I hate it. I crave quiet and space at times, but in this void, I’ve sought nothing but noise and other living, breathing people. I want to crave quiet again. I want to argue over who does the dishes, and watch the worst shows on Netflix because we’re bored and lazy and maybe a little too drunk from brunch.</p>
<p>This quiet, this space, will be filled. My life will continue, and I will meet someone. I will meet someones awesome, possibly. We will talk and romance and date. Someday they will move in. I fear the cycle repeating, but it is a human cycle of death and rebirth. Of beginnings and endings. I am at a beginning.</p>

      <title>The Allure of the minimal</title>

      <description>The Futures Most films that show our future are full of glitz and glamour, a fantastical land of flying vehicles. People live in clean, modern homes, and have their lives radically improved through technology, and want for nothing. Families and workers seamlessly keep in touch, and share parts of their lives with their friends and companions, and generally embrace the technology all around them.
If there is any enemy or ill feeling in the protagonist, it is usually an overlord or corporation that is taking over or slowly consuming their society.</description>

<p>Most films that show our future are full of glitz and glamour, a fantastical land of flying vehicles. People live in clean, modern homes, and have their lives radically improved through technology, and want for nothing. Families and workers seamlessly keep in touch, and share parts of their lives with their friends and companions, and generally embrace the technology all around them.</p>
<p>If there is any enemy or ill feeling in the protagonist, it is usually an overlord or corporation that is taking over or slowly consuming their society. What Sci-fi films lack is the ennui-ridden, laconic hipster Luddite who eschews the tech of the day for practices hundreds of years old. And yet, this is the future we live in.</p>
<h2 id="the-fetishs">The Fetishs</h2>
<p>For people like myself, the daily exposure to an always on connection can lead to dreaming of or even fetishizing disconnection. Tumblrs, Instagrams, and blogs all about country living, hand-made crafts, and wilderness exploration; where once we dreamed of hoverboards, HUDs, and instant content availability, we now dream of forests, shacks, and thick wool. In a very literal &ldquo;grass is always greener&rdquo; sense, many technologists and Internet workers I know dream of giving it all up for yurts, hikes, and leatherwork. Why fight with buzzing and demanding screens and sounds, when you can return to nature and regain a sense of humanity.</p>
<p>This attitude is parodied on Portlandia and Twitter, to humorous effect, but it really does exist. Men and women use old-fashioned tools to make cocktails with hand-chipped ice and eschew belts for suspenders.</p>
<p>And in many ways, the realization that there is more to life than flashing lights and bandwidth is hugely progressive. More than ever our relationships and environment are fading into the background of a global connectedness, and some are finding ways to rebel and recover. But, much like a casual drinker who swears off alcohol, it’s easy to go too far in the other direction. Paul Miller from the Verge is an example, albeit an admittedly extreme one. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3231386/offline-hows-it-going-paul-miller/in/2771566">In one Offline article</a>, he goes so far as to speak of the impracticality of working and not using the internet. His experiment with internet disconnectedness is almost over, and from his more recent articles, it seems that he didn’t get much out of it. And really, unless you make leather goods by hand, and sell them at a market, you're probably stuck on the web for some aspect of your life.</p>
<h2 id="a-possible-solution">A Possible Solution</h2>
<p>Really, going from always on to a Ted Kazynski cabin in the woods is a bad idea. It may seem exciting or sexy to become a lumberjack and live &ldquo;off the grid&rdquo;, but so many things about our modern conveniences are extremely helpful when used with discernment and moderation. The blind can see, the deaf can hear, and family thousands of miles away can speak to one another because of recent advances. These benefits should not be thrown out just because we have trouble putting our iPhones away during dinner. We <em>should</em> aim towards having Internet-free meals, or vacations, or weekends though. Learning the harder task of being offline <em>sometimes</em>, and not just joining a luddite cloister is a worthwhile discipline.</p>
<p>Stepping away from technology, much like putting aside work or a hard problem, can bring amazing perspective and appreciation for the marvels of our age. Instead of drastically changing our lifestyle, let’s strive to bring plain human interaction back into the life we already have.</p>
<p>And while it may not sound as exciting as building our own house in the woods, and making our own butter as we groom our beard with a bone comb, it's certainly a lot more achievable. We seem wired to desire drastic results and try extreme behavior to achieve them, but success in this regard is ephemeral. Minor tweaks to our behavior and routines won't look as interesting, but will help keep us sane and able to enjoy technology as a tool.</p>
<p>As many have said, &ldquo;don't let the ideal be the enemy of the good&rdquo;. Small changes to both our attitudes and actions can make huge improvements to our overall life quality.</p>
