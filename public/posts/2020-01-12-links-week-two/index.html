			<h1 class="title2">links week two</h1>
			<p>We’re halfway through with the first month of 2020, and the sun has been out a lot this week in the bay. Luckily, I got some new sunglasses so I’m feeling great about the whole thing.</p>
<p>Have you already mastered all of your New Year’s resolutions? Mine was the same as it is every year: “do more of what you love and less of what you hate”. So far, so good.</p>
<p>One of the things I love is writing, so I’ll keep on doing it. Another is the television program <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-09-rewatching-halt-catch-fire/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which I wrote about so that I could combine pleasures. If only I’d managed to eat prosciutto while writing, I would’ve likely passed out from delight.</p>
<p>Two new things I’m trying this year: going to the gym next to my office, and washing my face. I was a big powerlifter for over a year in Portland, but never found my rhythm here in the bay due to a weird commute. Fortunately, the gym next to my office seems great for lifting, and since it’s literally a few feet from the bus home, I think I’ll be able to use it at least a few times a week. Time will tell. As for washing my face? I’ve never really done it, so I’m not sure what I’ll get out of the whole endeavor, but I’m <em>aging</em> so I figured no time like the present.</p>
<p>Ok, sorry for the rambling, I know you’re here for&hellip; the links:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s chilly out in the northern hemisphere, so perhaps you’d enjoy a sauna or hot tub dip. If you’re not quite sold on them yet, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/05/16/sauna-enthusiasm-manga-sadou-steams-up-a-live-action-tv-drama">Sadou</a>, the delightful program about a sauna a lover is really delightful. I’m not sure if there are subtitles out there yet, but if you can speak Japanese, or just enjoy a show where you don’t know what’s being said, I highly recommend taking a look.</li>
<li>While we’re on the topic of Japan, how about a man who bakes <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7571/meet-lord-rod-the-sweet-potato-king-of-yokohama-japan?zd=1&amp;zi=uyn27jjq">sweet potatoes on the back of his custom Miata</a>? My friend Joe writes some truly engaging essays, and this one is especially fun.</li>
<li>If you prefer animated shows, <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/winter-2020-premiere-reviews/">this season of anime</a> is promising, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Eizouken">Eizouken</a>. There are some stinkers too, but hopefully you can avoid those.</li>
<li>Currently I’m reading a few things, and you might like them. First, a <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/">magazine about life</a> and often about turning things off and going out into the world. Next, a book that teaches you how to <a href="https://jkglei.com/unsubscribe/">get better at time and communication</a>. Finally, I am exploring the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_of_Glass">assassins with Celaena</a> and an assortment of dull men.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully these links keep you warm this week, and you’re able to find time for yourself and the things you love. Until next week!</p>
<p>See you space cowgirls~</p>
