			<p>Hello from a 200mph Nozomi Shinaksen train on my way to Tokyo! This train still feels like the future, and it’s especially wild that people are riding it and no one seems particularly worried.</p>
<p>Onomichi—where I was for the past few days—was gorgeous! Truly in rare form. If you’d like to read about that and see some photos of my hiking and exploring, you know <a href="https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/">where to go</a>.</p>
<p>I spent <em>four hours</em> on the phone today with Chase bank trying to move my flight forward a few days to try to ensure that I won’t be trapped outside of California. Were it not for Snorri, I might consider trying to just work and hide out in Japan during this pandemic, but for both him and my work, it’s probably good to head home. Knock on some wood for me, or send good travel vibes—whatever your method of magic may be.</p>
<p>You’re probably not here to read about my Japanese vacation travails though, so without further ado, here’s the links:</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/davdchristmas/status/1239196410857340933">https://mobile.twitter.com/davdchristmas/status/1239196410857340933</a></p>
<ul>
<li>You might know that I’m a racing fan, and especially love Formula 1 racing, but currently all the races this season are cancelled. Bummer. To get my high-octane thrill, I’ve resorted to watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3hEfwmzgDI">matchbox cars</a> thanks to my friend Stephan, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1cFm3dsaU">sim racing with actual F1 drivers</a>. YouTube is often a shitshow of terrible videos, but this week it’s a true savior with all of its odd niches. Maybe you’ll find a cool substitute for something you miss on there as well.</li>
<li>A few weeks ago, when we could still <em>gather</em>, I saw Kyle Chayka and Robin Sloan discuss Kyle’s new book. It was pretty fun, albeit sparsely attended. If you haven’t read <em>Longing for Less</em>, perhaps this will <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/03/the-pitfalls-and-the-potential-of-the-new-minimalism">convince you to pick up a a copy</a> from an independent bookstore. Robin even recommends a few other books in <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletter/march-2020/">his latest newsletter</a>.</li>
<li>I’m fascinated with the idea of <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/but-and/">“but/and”</a>. I’m not sure if it’ll catch on, but/and it’s cool.</li>
<li>Do you love museums? Do you love cats? <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cats-sneaking-security-ken-chan-gosaku-hiroshima-onomichi-city-museum-of-art/">Then you’re in luck</a>!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Are you as amped about Animal Crossing: New Horizon as I am? Make sure you’re prepared if you plan to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185977/animal-crossing-new-horizons-local-multiplayer-island-sharing">share your island with your family</a>. There are benefits, but as a woman who lives alone, I certainly would prefer to keep my island of Lesbos to myself. Reply to this email if you want my friend code though :D</li>
</ul>
<p>The train is about to pull into the station in Tokyo, and then I’ll hop onto the metro line to Asakusa. Drop me a line and tell me something you’ve loved this week. I’ll share some good things again next week if you’d like me to pass them along. And as always, wash your hands and see you next week, space cowgirls~</p>
