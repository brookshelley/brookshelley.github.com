			<p>As I write this, we’re fresh off the calling of the election for Joe Biden. I’m celebrating. I’m celebrating four years without a nightmare person in charge, and four years where the women, queer folks, and people of color who voted to change the direction of our democracy. In four years, I hope we get to vote for the future we want, instead of a tourniquet.</p>
<p>I hope you get to celebrate too.</p>
<p>Bless the resistance:</p>

<p>Let’s get to those links.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why is it that some cities feel fun to walk around, and in others it can feel like an endless slog to walk to the convenience store down the block? <a href="http://www.originalgreen.org/blog/2012/walk-appeal.html">Walk appeal</a>.</li>
<li>Have you ever considered juggling&hellip; for a small creature?</li>

<li>Now I’ll be the first to admit that I’m no economics genius, but <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2020/9/10/degrowth-and-mmt-a-thought-experiment">this seems pretty clever</a>.</li>
<li>Can you feel the colder weather? Do you feel like getting cozy? Maybe this <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/takibi-blanket">blanket</a> and these <a href="https://huckberry.com/store/greys/category/p/60830-the-outdoor-slipper-boot">slippers</a> will help. Personally I’m a big wool blanket fan, and wool slipper boots are part of my every day wear at home. Why not be comfy all the time?</li>
<li>If you think tech is boring skip this one, but I thought it was an interesting look at how <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/reviews/pixel-5-vs-iphone-12-which-camera-phone-shoots-better-night-photos">two camera systems</a> have changed when it comes to night photos. I’m super curious to see how much of a difference the new iPhone 12 Pro Max’ camera makes in quality of photos particularly.</li>
<li>When you’re done partying and celebrating a victory that <em>wasn’t even close</em>, you might need to wash some of those party clothes. Why is it that <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21523419/laundry-hate-chore-washing-machine">laundry is <em>still</em> such a chore</a>?! At my apartment, I have to take my basket 300m or so around a corner and through a couple doors, where inevitably someone will have finished laundry just sitting in the machine. COVID has made this trickier for sure. What if we all just went back to wearing stinky fur and leather? If we collectively lower our standards we can save a lot of time for watching tv.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>I am thinking a lot about leadership lately. What does it mean to be a good leader? A thoughtful one? A caring and supportive mentor? I’m a manager as of last week, and I aim to take it very seriously, while taking myself less so. If you have any tips, or books you’ve read (Lara Hogan and Camille Fourier are both on my shelf) <a href="mailto:newlsetter@brookshelley.com">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>I’m also thinking about how I want my state and country to be led. I want the people who are most ill-served by our government to have their voices heard, and to see themselves in the electorate. More black leaders, queer leaders, indigenous leaders, and a smorgasbord of genders. The demographics of the <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/election-demographics-race-trump-clinton/Content?oid=24192623">country are changing, and the elected should figure that out</a>. How do we elect another dozen socialist and environmentally-minded senators? How do we make sure that even in “progressive” cities that anti-worker legislation like Prop 22 doesn’t pass?</p>
<p>When our celebrations and hangovers are over, I know y’all will be all over that question.</p>
<p>For now, enjoy your weekend, congrats on the win, and let’s make sure 2021 looks better.</p>
