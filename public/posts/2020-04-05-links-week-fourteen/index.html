			<h1 class="title2">links week fourteen</h1>
			<p>This week I spent some time thinking about hoarding.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/cool.jpeg" alt="cool hoarders"></p>
<p>Specifically, toilet paper hoarding. I&rsquo;ve yet to venture out this week to the grocery, but the TP situation in my house is on its way to dire. I was able to procure <em>napkins</em> a week ago, so&hellip; needs must.</p>
<p>The only hoarding I&rsquo;ve managed to do, back when it was just called &ldquo;collecting&rdquo; was of alcohol. I&rsquo;m a little proud of my strange Shochu collection, largely enabled by my friends over at <a href="https://umamimart.com">Umami Mart</a> (who&rsquo;re still doing curbside pickup in the East Bay, btw).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brookshelley.com/photos/shochucollection.jpeg" alt="shochu collection"></p>
<p>As you can tell from the photo, I&rsquo;m prepared. You can also tell that Snorri is quite glad I&rsquo;m constantly around right now, since he gets a 24/7 warm body to sleep on, and climb on. He&rsquo;s only demanded things a few times.</p>
<p>Much of this quarantine has felt similar to my normal life, albeit with a touch more agoraphobia than usual. I spent a lot of time when I wasn&rsquo;t at work sitting at home in the <em>before times</em> and I&rsquo;m fortunate it&rsquo;s to my liking. I guess I miss seeing people occasionally, or going to restaurants a little, but we&rsquo;ll see if even I hit my limit. I spent around 4 years leaving my house minimally when I lived in Portland, and now I also have the aid of a therapist and medicine, so.</p>
<p>If your situation is different or tougher, I send you my love and a 6m distant hug. I know a few folks who&rsquo;re sick right now, and I hope they heal up again quick.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re online a lot right now to distract and entertain yourself, so I will do what I can to add some levity. Here&rsquo;s the links:</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can you <em>believe</em> it&rsquo;s been 30 years since <a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/pages/search-results-page?collection=shadowrun&amp;page=1&amp;rb_product_type=Rulebooks">Shadowrun</a> first launched? Frankly, I&rsquo;m a little shocked. This is a bit like those &ldquo;Nevermind came out longer ago from now than Led Zepplin&rsquo;s II&rdquo; for me. I&rsquo;ve only played a handful of games in those 30 years, because it seems hard to convince folks <em>not</em> to play D&amp;D, but I spent hours and hours reading the second-edition sourcebooks when I was a kid. Yes, I was the kind of child that read RPG sourcebooks alone. I still do.</li>
<li>Keeping things in the <em>past</em> I present to you an <a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch">emulator of the original NEXT browser</a> brought to my attention by <a href="www.craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> during a private live-streamed design of a website he did yesterday. I think it&rsquo;s a bit cool how many folks have started ambient live-streams of various activities. It feels like a very low-key way to hang out with people.</li>
<li>Another blast from the past—wow this week—is You Look Nice Today. They&rsquo;ve <em>returned</em> with <a href="https://www.californiaking.org">California King</a> and have stayed funny and delightful. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d seen much of Scott since the old days of YLNT, but I&rsquo;m always down for <em>yet another</em> Merlin man joint. If you decide to listen to the archives of YLNT, perhaps keep in mind that they&rsquo;ve grown a bit as people, and you might hear some less than ideal content in the old ones. Que sera sera.</li>
<li>During a foraging session, I managed to buy some whole wheat starter, but no yeast. No matter, I&rsquo;ve begun to make a <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/">starter</a>. This feels a little prairie home for me, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to <em>more bread</em> because going out to buy fresh baguette every few days is not a good quarantine habit, I&rsquo;ve found. I&rsquo;ll report back on the bread in the future.</li>
<li>Finally, I share with you a regular &lsquo;ol blog from <a href="https://indoor-voices.blogspot.com/">a few writers similarly stuck into their homes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to those of you who&rsquo;ve emailed me in the past few weeks to chat or comment on the email! I really love reading stuff from y&rsquo;all, and will try to reply back most of the time. I know folks who&rsquo;ve subscribed are a bit scattered around the globe, so it&rsquo;s nice to get the chance to catch-up through the asynchronous magic of email and RSS. If any of you keep a blog or have a newsletter, definitely let me know. I&rsquo;m logging off for now to go watch the second season of Ozark and whittle down a bit of that shochu collection. See you next week, space cowgirls~</p>
