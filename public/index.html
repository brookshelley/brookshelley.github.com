					  Dill &amp; Fennel 10/4/20 October is full of surprises and delights so far. I feel like so many of us have held our collective breath, waiting for folks who so flagrantly flaunt the recommendations of doctors and scientists to reap what they’ve sown. The reaping began on Thursday night.
After the low of the debate this week, which I ended-up watching after swearing I wouldn’t, Thursday was a breath of fresh air.

					<div class="summary">
					  September It’s been a wild month here in the Bay Area, with wildfires, smoke, and record-breaking heat. Because I didn’t have much else to do, I read and watched a lot of things. On the TV front, you should check out Ted Lasso for a kind-hearted, and joyful show. Lovecraft Country is not great on trans or queer issues, but is generally pretty awesome, and the Great British Bake-Off is back and quarantining together to prevent filming stoppage.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 9-27-20 Everybody watch out, I own a laser now. Far from being a futuristic laser pistol, it’s a much more banal home hair removal laser. As a trans lady, the ‘ol hormones left me with some annoying dark facial hair that I’ve mostly blasted off, but in quarantine time I’ve been unable to finish my treatment. So, if you hear some yowls coming from emeryville, that’s just me.

					  2020 Homescreen This year was mostly a nightmare for all the gestures around reasons.
However, for my 2020 homescreen on my iPad and iPhone, it was pretty wild. iOS 14 brought the concept of homescreen widgets to iOS after years of waiting, and they're pretty damn good. Another year Every year for the past few years I’ve written about the apps I’m using and what appears on my iPhone Home Screen.

					  A new keyboard Or, how I reprogrammed my brain to understand an ortholinear keyboard.
During my work from home, I’ve slowly upgraded my computing setup to keep me from constant soreness. First, it was a real deal office chair and desk, then a monitor. Finally this week, I added a split keyboard to alleviate wrist issues.
A history of keyboards For years I’ve written primarily on a MacBook or iPad keyboard, which is pretty cramped and ensures my trainer tells me to do more ITY stretches all the time.
