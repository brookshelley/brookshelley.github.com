					<div class="summary">
					  In my previous post, I talked about anticipating XOXO 2018, which ended last night. Today, I am tired, happy, and trying to remember what to do for work when I'm not awkwardly wandering around a stadium full of 2000+ people.
So. Many. People. This year I was overwhelmed by the size of XOXO in ways I hadn't been in the past. To be fair, two years ago I was only a year into working from home, whereas now I'm 3 years a hermit, but still, 2000 people is a lot.

					  My 3rd XOXO Thinking about the next few days in Portland, I'm thrilled beyond measure. So many new and old friends will be in my city, wandering around, making and showing art, and eating tons of food. When I first attended XOXO in 2015 I had no idea what to expect. I'd been to SXSW for years, growing-up in Austin, but never before had I felt so surrounded by rad, like-minded people.

					  Due to a series of forest fires, Portland has looked like an alien planet for the past few weeks.
Every day I wake up and google &ldquo;air quality&rdquo; to see just how much I need to stay indoors, next to my air filter. My gym has closed for a few days for two weeks, and walking outside just plain sucks.
The only cool part is the sunsets are ridiculous, and the moon is red at night.

					  Young Brook Growing up, I never wanted to be big. My parents were both over 6&rsquo; tall, and I worried about being as big as them. Most of my friends ended up being shorter than me, and were usually skinnier too. I was made fun of for being &ldquo;chubby&rdquo; in middle school, and that stuck with me. Being fat or chubby or skinny all rule, but I didn't know that as a kid.

					<div class="summary">
					  A few years ago, after moving to Portland, I discovered a secret: you can do almost anything alone. I'd lived in Austin for most of my life, and as I quickly learned once moving, making friends in Portland is a long process. So, on a whim, I started seeing movies by myself. I went to dinner alone with a book. I even saw concerts&hellip; solo, and it was fun. I don't know why we all think you have to do these activities with other people, but when you go alone you don't have to wait for anyone to be ready to go, or to leave.

					<div class="summary">
					  Inspired by both Nick and Matt, I've decided to try my hand at blogging again on this site. I don't know how often I'll post, but at least once a month, I'll do a media dietpost, which clips out what I read and watched that month from the long lists I keep. Maybe I'll talk about other stuff too. We'll see!
I have definitely enjoyed how Matt seems to be posting cool things there instead of Twitter, because it gives me more things to see on RSS.
