					<div class="summary">
					  It's been a busy week! At my company, we had Monday and Friday off, and most of our staff took off the entire week. I decided to work through the week for some reason, and ended-up getting a lot done! Suffering from a bout of creative excitement, I also redesigned my site to try to beat the Google performance measure and load fully under two seconds. Yes. I'm a frontend pervert.

					<div class="summary">
					  My personal site started off as a way to keep track of books and movies I’d read and watched outside of the world of Goodreads or other ad-based sites. I’ve lost lots of data in the past, and ultimately it’s just much easier to keep text portable and backed-up when it’s a .txt or .md
In the ensuing years, I’ve written a few blog posts, and listed tons of books and movies but I hadn’t done much with my site’s structure or design besides moving my static site generator from Jekyll to Hugo on a whim last year.

					  Welp, first sunburn of the quarantine for this gal. I spent the afternoon in a friend’s yard (hi André and Haley) and forgot my skin has been softened by indoor lighting for months. On the upside, it was gorgeous outside, and I’m glad I got to sit in the sun.
Since I’ll be indoors for a while healing-up, a lot of todays’s links are indoor kid interests. So if you’re like me, I think you’ll enjoy these:

					  Trying out a new name for this that isn’t just “links”. Fennel and dill are two of my favorite flavors, but also a terrible combination. They also happen to be my utterly bizarre chest-piece tattoo. If you follow this newsletter but haven’t ever met me in person, just know I have a lot of botanical tattoos.
My snacking game is strong now that I know how to make my own tortillas on demand, and endless sourdough.

					  Ten loaves of sourdough! That’s how many loaves I have made thus far during the pandemic (or pan-demic if you’ll excuse my pun). Have you found a fulfilling hobby? Gotten really good at a driving simulator? Taken up amateur plumbing? I went out last weekend for the first time, albeit just down the street to sit in a friend’s yard, far from said friend. It was pretty nice, and I keep thinking I should perhaps do a little more biking and walking, but then I see a dozen people walking around massless, and I get some combination of furious and scared all over again.

					  Happy May! We made it through an April that lasted conservatively one thousand years. I hope you're well, and finding new ways of living and thriving as we settle in for Summer.
I've been cleaning, rearranging, and making lots of bread—I think I've finally sorted out my Sourdough woes.
One thing I can recommend for anyone looking to clean up a little are a bunch of little velcro strips to manage those cables.
