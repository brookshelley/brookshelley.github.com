					  2020 began in earnest, and despite it being winter, in the Bay Area it’s delightfully sunny. I spent the first week largely sitting by the window of my apartment, reading and studying Japanese. So far, I really enjoy the slower pace of this decade.
Books Mainline — Deborah Christiansen
A fun throwback to the world of cyber decks and assassins. I wish I’d found this in 1996, but it holds up well.

					  redesigns and long reads. I got to see William Gibson this week in the city, and listening to his southern drawl discuss the intricacies of stubs and alternate realities. Once I finish Mainline, I can’t wait to dive into Agency. Maybe every generation has a real feeling of living in the future, but between tech news and world news, things are a little too reminiscent of sad cyberpunk. This is why I read fiction—at least there we can have heroes.

					  January is nearly over! I had a delicious meal last night of pork cartilage soup (豚軟骨汁) and dug into an old classic sci-fi book on recommendation from Robin Sloan’s newsletter. It’s weird and fun so far. I also started back at the gym last week, which left me hobbling around as my body complains about all the rowing I did. At least it’s next to my office!
Enough about that, here’s more links:

					  We’re halfway through with the first month of 2020, and the sun has been out a lot this week in the bay. Luckily, I got some new sunglasses so I’m feeling great about the whole thing.
Have you already mastered all of your New Year’s resolutions? Mine was the same as it is every year: “do more of what you love and less of what you hate”. So far, so good.

					<div class="summary">
					  The first time When Halt &amp; Catch Fire first aired, I was lucky enough to clue in and watch it weekly on AMC. As a Texan with a dad who occasionally worked in or at least around tech, and then joined the industry myself, it captured the world I grew up in incredibly well. Starting out a little rough, it became a show all about family and how ambition can destroy everything.

					  Links: Week One It’s 2020! Welcome to the new decade. Imagine for a moment the news hasn’t already been wild, and step into a this list of joy and edutainment instead. A lot of links this week are to older projects for folks I’ve mentioned before, because I just got back from a long holiday of reading and watching things on tv, so I rediscovered some old favorites. I also redesigned my website, and moved it from Jekyll to Hugo, which meant some painful time with Go templating.
