					<div class="summary">
					  Out of 74 movies, I wanted to pick a few that really stood out, and then talk briefly about a few that I really didn't enjoy. I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn't get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I've accrued over the years.

					<div class="summary">
					  Way back in February of 2019, I sent my first newsletter—a repost of a blog post about learning Japanese, then petered out for a bit. In July, I began sending weekly link emails, which I managed to keep up through the end of the year. It's been quite a fun Sunday activity, so I thought I'd chat a bit about what the experience of weekly link writing was like.
Why links?

					<div class="summary">
					  This year I read 55 books and a lot of graphic novels. Fortunately, most of them were pretty great, which made it even harder to pick out my five favorite. I gravitated towards a lot of fantasy and sci-fi in 2019 as a nice way to escape or even think about a potentially scarier future. My plan to keep reading primarily female authors also paid off.
In no particular order, here’s the list:

					  A new backpack for everyday carry, and travel.
First Sight After first getting my new Bellroy sling, I fell in love with the delightful material for these bags. A few months later in Iitoya in Japan, I got to see their new Shift backpack in person, and almost bought one on the spot. that bag was a little larger than I need, but then I saw this. With the launch of the Studio Backpack, Bellroy has made an excellent bag that holds a little or a lot without every looking absurd.

					<div class="summary">
					  Another year has rushed past, and with it, another iPhone update and some changes to my phone since last year's setup. My use of a single screen of apps continues, with a few major and minor changes alongside.
I've posted these for the past few years, so if you want to see what apps I was using in 2017, here you go.
Some things change 3 app dock—I moved my Twitter app out of my dock in order to spend less time on Twitter.

					<div class="summary">
					  The Playlist Here's all the albums I really loved this year easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.
The Albums  Cheap Queen — King Princess  Bless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.
Emily Alone — Florist  A deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.
