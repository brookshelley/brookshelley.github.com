					  This is the week of the Magic Keyboard which I’m using to write this email. If you’re curious, or considering picking one up, the linked review should help you decide. For something more exhaustive, perhaps check out this longer look:
  In other news, my company has extended our work from home until at least September, which means I’m going to see so many more movies, and play so much Gran Turismo.

					<div class="summary">
					  Watching friends and reviewers get their new Magic Keyboards in the mail all week was brutal, because every word I read about them, and video I watched just made me want to touch one more. In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.
In a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.

					  This week marked my first sourdough loaves, which were delicious and a bit flat. It turns out having a scale is crucial, and hopefully next week I will get to address that lack. I also got a few of my hobby shipments in, which meant building a tiny Porsche and beginning a small robot. Being stuck indoors all day alone is a great excuse for rediscovering things I enjoyed when I was a weird shut-in kid.

					  Welcome to your weekly installment of “what’s Brook reading and clicking on now?” The quarantine here in the Bay Area is 4 weeks on, I think, and today I briefly saw a friend outside while dropping off groceries. It was nice. I hope you’ve had some distant human contact this month too. I’ve also been buying wine from Ordinaire, along with various tinned fishes, because this shit sucks, but wine and mackerel are delightful.

					  This week I spent some time thinking about hoarding.
Specifically, toilet paper hoarding. I've yet to venture out this week to the grocery, but the TP situation in my house is on its way to dire. I was able to procure napkins a week ago, so&hellip; needs must.
The only hoarding I've managed to do, back when it was just called &ldquo;collecting&rdquo; was of alcohol. I'm a little proud of my strange Shochu collection, largely enabled by my friends over at Umami Mart (who're still doing curbside pickup in the East Bay, btw).

					  Ah, I’ve returned to the Americas. This week, Japan started quarantining as well, so I just missed the cutoff there and was largely able to enjoy wandering around like usual. I still tried to socially distance while I was in Tokyo and Osaka however, and I even blogged about it in five parts. Overall, it was a strange trip, but a fun one. I hope I get to travel back to Japan again in November after the quarantine ends.
