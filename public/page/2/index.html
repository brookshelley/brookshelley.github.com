					  Dill &amp; Fennel 9-20-20 Finally, a brief respite in the smoke! I got to go on a nice long bike ride around the lake as soon as the air hit green. The rest of the week could’ve been spent outside, but I mostly just worked-out and play video games. Oh well.
The news of RBG’s death last night made me pretty sad, but also reminded me that a future that’s better than any past we’ve had depends on each and every one of us resisting and working towards it.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 9-13-20 Greetings from the surface of Mars! Wednesday in the Bay Area was deeply scary and awful, but the smoke has stayed here albeit in a lower-to-the-ground fashion all week. I haven’t really been outside since two Wednesdays ago, and I hate it.
Keep folks in Oregon in your thoughts too, because their air quality is even worse than ours, and friends around Portland are preparing to potentially evacuate.

					  Becoming a plant lady Ten years ago, I saw indoor plants as inconvenient, unwieldy, and dirty. Now, my house looks like this:
What happened?
Thanks Laurel One year for Christmas, my roommate in Portland gave me a book and a single plant, and once I figured out how not to kill it, I got addicted to greenery.
I think it was the combination of cloudy skies, and an appreciation of the outdoors that Portland granted me which helped me change.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 9-6-20 Well, it’s hot again in the Bay Area, on top of this wild smoke we’ve got everywhere. I’m pretty tired of it, for one, especially since I mostly want to hike and ride my bike right now. I did manage to go outside a little today to repot a LOT of plants. More on that later, but here’s one pretty plant from my house to tide you over.

					  Hugo and iAWriter When I started writing my blog in earnest again, I wanted to find a workflow I could use on both iOS and Mac with ease. I use an iPad and iPhone mostly, so I didn't want a system that required a lot of fiddliness, which meant a build pipeline that automated as much as possible. My goal was a site I could write to, publish to, and read from with a minimum of app switching or ssh-ing.
