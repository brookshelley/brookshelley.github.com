					  Dill &amp; Fennel 8-9-20 How’s your August going? Are you doing any hiking or swimming? Planning any solo adventures? I’m planning a backpacking trip in the near future that has me pretty stoked, especially because of all the gear I get to buy and try out. I’m a sucker for gear, obviously. I spent all of Saturday finishing the latest Tamsyn Muir book, Harrow the Ninth, and eating oysters with a couple pals at an outdoor distance (hi Christine and Anna).

					  A GRIII Review A street photography camera for empty streets In the before times, I travelled a lot. On average I flew 25 times a year, and left the country on 2-4 of those trips. I've written a lot about traveling light, so it won't surprise you that I usually bring my iPhone as my sole camera. A few years ago, I picked-up a Canon G9X Mark II to take with me to Singapore and Reykjavik.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 31 Another weekend is upon us! Blessed weekend! It’s August, can you believe it?! I read some old journal entries today from the before times and it’s funny to see how much my life and activities were the same as they are now. When this pandemic is wrapped-up, I know I’ll appreciate a quick visit to a wine bar much more, at least for a few weeks. This week also marked the end of my second month of 3x a week workout classes, which I think is making a difference in my energy and emotional health.

<p>It’s midsummer here in Oakland, and due to the persistence of people’s risky behavior, we’re still very quarantined. At this rate, I might read quite a few more books than I initially imagined I would, as it could be well rinto 2021 before anything changes. I’m still watching quite a bit of TV, and the Formula 1 season that finally started. Seeing folks drive cars all over Europe is quite the treat.</p>

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 30 This weekend was pretty nice in the Shelley house—we started early by taking Friday off to volunteer for the Women’s Foundation (Snorri mostly yelled), and spent the rest of our time laying around (Snorri), and playing Good Sudoku. I’ve also thought about getting back into shooting photos and biking around, which could be a fun adventure. In preparation, I even picked-up a new camera, so expect better pictures of my cat and neighborhood soon.
