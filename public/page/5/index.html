					  Fennel &amp; Dill 29 Happy March 141st! Time continues to show up for me in the cycles of life—laundry, therapy, medicine, and plant watering. With news that most schools will open virtually in the fall, I get the sense that “summer” for kids will continue well into 2021, albeit without pool parties. It’s a weird, life-defining time. Snorri and I are weathering things well, and possibly even thriving. As my friend Lena said yesterday, “I’m an indoor cat”.

					  Microposting After a few days of playing around with micropub and the indieweb (which seems to largely be from 2018 and 2019) I have a micropub server that works with Hugo and integrates with iAWriter. Hooray!
With the beta of iOS 14 I’ve had to heavily modify my publishing shortcuts, and while they’re pretty great, publishing directly through Micropub with the “publish” button in iAWriter seems even more convenient.
If you’re using Hugo or Jekyll, this is a good starting place, and only needs minor tweaks to exposed config values to work with most setups of either static backend.

					  Another week, and another Formula One race in Austria. For the first time in the over 70 year history of this race series two races occurred at the same track. The first race included loads of suspension and tire issues due to curbs, and this weekend included with a veritable lake on the track. If you’ve never watched car racing, I recommend Netflix’s excellent behind-the-scenes series. Outside of high speed racing, my week was a bit of a let-down, as I found out I didn’t get a position at work I’d interviewed for on Wednesday.

					  Well, the long weekend and constant fireworks in Oakland threw me for a loop! I lost track of the days and thought it was Saturday, and I still had an entire evening to prepare this email for you. Alas! Here’s a rare evening edition my newsletter.
Links  This account is utterly bizarre and so are these warnings. There’s a strangely surreal aspect to a lot of the governments social media, that I can’t tell whether I find charming or depressing.

					  The bay this week was thankfully cooler than the past month. My body was thankful for the heat respite, and Snorri was cuddlier as a result. This week felt long, after having Juneteenth off last week, but next Friday we observe Independence Day, so it’s another short week. I can’t say I’m looking forward to the even more ubiquitous fireworks, but hopefully the cops will finally run out.
I spent a lot of time watching tv this week, and enjoying good Japanese Whiskey.
