					  Hiking Thanks to my friend Lena, I got to test out my new hiking shoes today at Redwood Regional Park.
We did a very chill 5 mile hike with 1500â€™ climb and a total descent of 1000â€™.
I think my workout program is really helping because while it wasnâ€™t always easy to hike this trail, it was super doable and really fun. I ended-up with only a couple small blisters I chalk up to brand new shoes.

					  August I really jammed a lot of movies into the last few months of August, but mostly I watched The Boys and Alone. Iâ€™m hopeful Hollywood will give up on theater launches of films so I can watch stuff like Tenet sooner than later. Also, fuck our stateâ€™s ability to deal with the wildfires and the damage to folksâ€™ health and us being forced inside. Itâ€™s a hella bummer that global warming caused by the global north is slowly making California inhospitable.

					<div class="summary">
					  Backpacking gear With flying out of the question, especially to other countries, I decided to do a bit of local adventuring. With the encouragement and planning of some Slack pals, I began to plan for a few days of backpacking, and more importantly, a few days of gear. Anyone whoâ€™s read my blog for a bit knows Iâ€™m a nerd about backpacks, technical clothing, and having the absolute minimum amount of stuff with me on trips.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 8-30-20 Welcome to my delayed last newsletter of the month. I had some pals by yesterday to sit at a distance in my courtyard and when the last one went home, I fell right asleep. Itâ€™s such a nice thing to see friends right now, especially when you can share some wine and lots of laughs.
This week is a mix of weird and sad as usual. Iâ€™m working on some longer form posts for brookshelley.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 8-23-20 Ah, breathe deep the fires of California. Just in case you needed another reason to stay inside and wear a mask, dry thunderstorms have delivered. I donâ€™t know how you feel about this but itâ€™s pretty depressing and scary to me.

&mdash; Matt Haughey ðŸ˜· (@mathowie) August 20, 2020  Sorry to kick off with a bummer! I hope youâ€™re ok with occasionally being sad together before we dig into the joyful weirdness of links.

					  Dill &amp; Fennel 8-17-20 This weeks email was written an entire day early as I plan to head up a mountain and camp for a night. It's going to be hot so I hope the mountain is a little cooler. This will be round one of camping during quarantine, and my first camping trip since 2017! I've finally found friends who are equally interested in camping and hit me up when they want to do so.
