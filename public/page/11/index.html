					  This weekend is a bit sad, as it would have marked my countdown to a two week vacation in Japan, but due to coronavirus I had to cancel the trip. Perhaps I’ll do something else, but right now I’m just worried for my friends and coworkers abroad and at home. Keep your hands washed, your spirits up, and your days full of love.
I did plan a second trip this year in November for the amazing Focus retreat put on by Craig Mod.

					  This was the week I left Twitter for a while. Honestly it wasn’t so bad, once I got over the twitchy “gotta open Twitter” feeling. I’ll write more about that experience soon, with some light suggested reading and a few tips. My main takeaway so far is that I spent a lot of time opening and closing and reopening Twitter for the last 10 years.
Here are a few things I would’ve sent:

					  The problem I've been on Twitter for over a decade, and found that lately it's been more depressing and less enjoyable. I follow around five hundred people, of which I'd estimate 2-300 actively tweet every month. Because many of the users I follow are friends of mine I want to keep up with their lives and jokes, but that leads me to compulsively check my Twitter client of choice throughout the day on iOS and Mac.

					  First of all, look at this DUCK!

I’m writing this intro at my dining table, while someone cleans my house. Hiring a house-cleaner is one of the most awkward and also incredible things I’ve done in the past few years. I learned it’s a lot cheaper than I thought it would be—in Portland it cost 60 bucks a session. I haven’t figured out how to not feel like I’m in the way the whole time, or how to comfort Snorri, but at least my house is pretty damn clean for a few days.

					  Shochu, CSS, and “enough”
This week marked the inaugural Figma conference, which I was able to attend through my employer. It was neat to be surrounded by designers from all over the world, and think about how to solve bigger problems than just “how to make people click”.
I also got to meet up with Craig Mod of hiking, ebook, and Leica writing renound—he’s a delight. At a certain point in life I realized most of the people I dig know each other, so it wasn’t a surprise he knew the Andys and Patrick.

					  A fiscal happy new year to you! I still don't really understand how fiscal years work, but in addition to a lunar new year, Snorri and I celebrated the beginning of FY21, and the 6th anniversary of my employer this weekend. Thrills and chills.
Doesn't it already feel like spring? Just a little bit? At least in the bay, the plant outside are flowering, and it's already a little warm-is. This is my second year of not really having a winter, and I find the whole thing deeply confusing.
