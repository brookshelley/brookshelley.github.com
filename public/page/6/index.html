					<div class="summary">
					  Like most of the folks who marginally to maximally care about Apple stuff, I watched WWDC today from my house on my TV. Our work chat was going wild throughout, especially during the bits about the ARM transition over the next few years. Overall, I felt like this was an excellent set of announcements, handled in a fun and entertaining way despite the remote nature. Also shout out to Craig's bold chest-hair revealing sartorial choice.

					<div class="summary">
					  It’s a foggy, overcast Saturday as I write this newsletter. Yesterday, my company gave Juneteenth off as time to volunteer and remember, and I spent most of the day with the Women’s Foundation of Oregon discussing budgets and our COVID relief fund. As a Texan, I grew up hearing about Juneteenth, but still hadn’t fully understood Texas as “part of the south” until a few years ago, since Austin had firmly insulated itself from owning our history.

					<div class="summary">
					  <p>It’s been a rough week for so many folks I love due to police violence and a Friday rollback of national trans healthcare. I hope you’re taking care of yourself, and your loved ones. Reach out, and stick together, even if we’re far away from each other.</p>
<p>I’ll keep sending out these link emails every week though, as I think it’s important to read and see things that can surprise, delight, or teach us even as we mourn and fight.</p>

					<div class="summary">
					  After twenty years of this CBS reality show being on TV, I finally jumped on board as a fan. A few years ago, a podcast I enjoy discussed a John Siricusa’s longstanding love of Survivor, and even offered a list of his favorite seasons. I dipped a toe in with one season, then promptly decided that was enough, until March brought a shelter at home.

					<div class="summary">
					  This is my eleventh week in quarantine, since I was in Japan when the Bay Area shut down. COVID is still scary, but it’s been an even harder week due to police violence against black Americans, murdering multiple people and assaulting countless more. Fuck the cops. Fuck the violent, racist state.
With that said, I will go ahead and share some links, as usual, with a few that may help you grapple with what’s happening right now.

					<div class="summary">
					  Before March I rarely baked. Outside of a few misadventures as a kid, I’d mostly made hand pies, and a few loaves of pulla, but bread was mostly beyond me. Just like the yeast that seeded Carl, my starter, sourdough making was in the air. My favorite sourdough baker Acme’s loaves became hard to get from Berkeley Bowl a few weeks into the quarantine, so I decided to follow along with everyone else, and get way too into bread making.
