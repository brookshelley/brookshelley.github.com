[{"categories":null,"contents":" My first entire month in quarantine. Plenty of time to read, watch movies, and play Civ 6 (and keep losing). I also picked-up Gran Turismo and raced virtual cars for countless hours. This month felt like a year.\nBooks Polaris Rising — Jessie Mihalik\nA mix of space caper and Harlequin Romance, there was entirely too much straight sex in this for me. But, if you think “space operas should have more picking out dresses and rough hands on waists,” then this is the book for you.\nZero Sum Game — SL Huang\nAh a female protagonist who uses her math expertise to leap through windows and shoot bad guys! This book ruled. I’m not sure what this character’s “struggle” is going to be, because in the first book at least she’s a little invincible, but either way it was fun.\nThe Factory — Hiroko Oyamada\nA strange, short book with some challenging dialogue formatting. I really loved the small vignettes of slightly-slanted banal work life in The Factory. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to read more of Oyamada\u0026rsquo;s work, because despite reading quite a bit of Japanese fiction, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the chance to read very many Japanese women. I hope that I either get better at kanji to the point I can read from the source, or more translators translate other women.\nMovies After the Storm\nKoreeda is one of the best directors when it comes to presenting the sadly funny banality of life. I can’t fathom someone else who could present a deadbeat dad and dysfunctional family with such pathos. This isn’t quite as heartrending as Shoplifters, but it comes close.\nGame Night\nJust a good time. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and it hopped along at a good clip while keeping me laughing.\nHustlers\nI love a good grift. I’m still low-key mad this wasn’t about a lesbian romance between J Lo and Constance Wu though.\nJumanji: Next Level\nHave you ever wanted to see the Rock play Dan Devito? What about Jack Black playing a younger black guy? This movie was more bizarre than the last but hey, it was also fun.\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\nThe extras’ costuming in this film is deeply strange, with a mix of “Indiana Jones pan-middle-east” and “Mad Max”. This whole film was a glorious mess, and I loved it.\nThe Guest\nThis was surprisingly funny and very bizarre. I really enjoy Dan Stevens, ever since his turn as Xavier’s son Legion.\nPrisoners\nIn preparation for the eventual release of the new Dune film I wanted to familiarize myself with Villneuve’s ourve. This is a very good mystery film with a grittier Gyllenhal than his turn at Zodiac.\nRythym Section\nA training montage revenge flick that slowly transforms into a pretty thrilling action movie.\nBloodshot\n“I don’t mind the scars, I just don’t like the stories they tell.” With a time-to-tanktop of just under 5 minutes, you know from the jump this will be a new Diesel vehicle. This movie had it all: underwater tai-chi, weightlifting, Guy Pierce, and a drinking competition to hone in on Vin’s favorite shot. Of course, as a Chinese-financed movie, there’s no blood or sex or skeletons. Also why didn’t they put that one guy’s eyes in his head instead of on his chest?! “He’s a techie, just like me!”\nRadius\nInteresting conceptually, but it didn’t really go anywhere besides the concept. It would’ve been better as an anime, lol.\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\nWell, fuck. That was gorgeous and sad. This movie built until my heart ached, and wove a story of falling in love.\nCrawl\nIt’s no Underwater, but I guess if you want to see a great reason not to visit Florida, this is a perfect anti-ad.\nUnderwater\nThis turned out was cooler that i was expecting. Can’t say much more without spoiling anything.\nGeneral Magic\nAfter seeing the fictionalized versions of many of these folks in Steve Jobs, and hearing so many stories about others—some of whom I’ve met—this was a really interesting look at a company that catalyzed much of what we use every day to live online.\nSteve Jobs\nOh, hey, it’s Shiv! It’s kind of fascinating that the entire story is told through the lead-up to the presentations that implanted Steve Jobs in so many of our brains. I really enjoyed seeing this, and also think it’s funny this came out only 2 years after the Kutcher film. Also, Fassbender has a way cooler vibe that the actual Jobs\u0026hellip; I mean, he’s Magneto!\nThe Social Network\nOne of the wildest things about this movie is the that Facebook’s valuation at the time of the credits rolling was only $25 billion. A few years later, it’s nearly 500 billion. I left Facebook 3 years before this film came out, and briefly returned while in Portland. I get the sense the characters in the film might be less likable in real life.\nApollo 13\nSuch a fantastic film. It’s surprising how well this held up, with many practical effects and no terrible CGI. It’s been 25 years and this one still had me on the edge of my seat.\nOverlord\nThis felt a bit like a video game. Lots of nazis getting blown up? Weird underground lab? Strange NPCs? Check.\nBirds of Prey\nIt’s a low bar, but this is definitely the best DCU movie since all the serious Nolan Batman films. Not only was it silly fun, it managed to build interesting characters and solid battles that put the overwrought CGI-fest of Avengers to shame. I hope if they make more of these they keep the formula. I really want to see a love story between Poison Ivy and Harley.\n1917\nA very intense movie but it was also beautiful in its own way. I get why this won awards. Weird cameo by Doctor Strange though.\n","date":"April, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2020-04-30-april/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"april"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Watching friends and reviewers get their new Magic Keyboards in the mail all week was brutal, because every word I read about them, and video I watched just made me want to touch one more. In the time of quarantine, there’s no store to visit to try new products out, so instead we’re left waiting for delivery, and hoping everything lives up to our dreams.\nIn a sentence: this is my new favorite keyboard.\nHeavy My first thought when I took the Magic Keyboard package out of the mailbox was, “yow, this is heavy.” After taking the keyboard out of its packaging, the heft remained, but once I attached my iPad to it and started typing, I forgot all about the weight. Sure, this will be a bit heavier for travel, but the modularity is worth it for me. I can’t wait to type on this while traveling, then pull the iPad off the keyboard to carry around for reading in a park, or watching a tv show. It makes me wish it were possible to pull the screen off of my work computer and walk around with it too!\nModular Ever since getting the Smart Keyboard, my iPad basically never left it. I carried my iPad around daily, fingers pressed into the keys awkwardly on the back of the screen. The previous keyboard for the iPad was also super strange in its own way, but looking back, having a primary iPad case expose you to the keyboard buttons constantly when all you want to do is read is so silly. This new Magic Keyboard makes no concessions to using it while not typing. The ease of removing the iPad from the keyboard (I’m almost tempted to call it a dock) is such that I don’t even think about taking my iPad with me to another room, sans keyboard. This mode-changing makes the iPad feel even more futuristic than it did before, especially because my hands are only now becoming accustomed to the thin, metallic body of the iPad, instead of the strange rubber skin of the keyboard case its lived in up until now.\nThunk So, what’s the keyboard actually like to type on?\nFantastic.\nUnlike most folks, I really enjoyed both the butterfly keyboard in my MacBook, and the cloth-covered one on the Smart Keyboard. I enjoyed the short-travel, and the weird texture, but the feel and thunk of this new keyboard is even better. I don’t really care about the backlighting, and I’m a little bit more concerned about the gaps that invite in stray drops of water, but as I mentioned above, I don’t plan to carry this with me all the time, so it’s more likely I’ll have a glass of wine sans non-waterproof keyboard, and keep drinks away when I plan to type.\nI typed this review on the new keyboard, and the experience was absolutely fantastic. The new trackpad is small, but the ability to quickly laser-target my edits is a delight. No longer do I have to tap, stab, tap tap, arrow, arrow, arrow. I can just point, and click, and voila. When I’m not at work, I more or less only use my iPad, and this new keyboard means the typing I do will be faster, feel better, and even sound more pleasingly thunky.\nShould you buy it? Do you type on your iPad? Do you want to? Have you been tempted to plug your iPad into a monitor and use a Bluetooth trackpad? Do you love writing on the go?\nIf so, then this is probably the right keyboard for you. If you only occasionally reach for your iPad to watch YouTube videos, or are the kind of person who thinks traveling with an iPad and a MacBook is totally acceptable, then save your $300. In the same way that I’ve never purchased an Apple Pencil, many iPad users will never purchase this keyboard, and I think that’s totally fine. But the folks that do buy one, and get to experience the entirely wonderful experience of typing and editing will be incredibly satisfied, I think.\n","date":"April, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-04-24-ipad-magic-keyboard-review/","tags":["ipad","travel","review"],"title":"iPad Magic Keyboard Review"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Books Empress of Forever — Max Gladstone\nA fun space romp with a Jobsian lesbian protagonist and a strange cast of characters. This quickly shifts into a very different book from what it starts as, but I still loved it. More space lesbians, please.\nA Song for a New Day — Sarah Pinsker\nWelp, my second book for the month was another plague book, albeit one that largely took place in the aftermath of a pox. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, even if it was a little too hopeful for my usual taste. Honestly, it was a little refreshing to read a book where cool women make music and care about each other, and hope for the future. Thanks Haley for the tip on this one.\nWanderers — Chuck Wendig\nPhew, that was a dark fucking book. With the pandemic going on in the world right now, this wasn’t a very good idea to read, but I’m glad I finished it. Just about every bad thing you can imagine happens in this book, so I have a hard time recommending it, but perhaps for folks who don’t believe in global warming or in the danger of a pandemic, this will give them pause.\nLurking — Joanne McNeil\nA very interesting look at the history of the internet as a user. One of the best non-fiction books I’ve read in a while.\nMovies The Martian\nAnother rewatch. I had a FaceTime call where my friend Lena and I discussed Halt and Catch Fire, which reminded me how much I enjoyed this film, which I took to be about the competence of McKenzie Davis’ character. This was my first time watching this movie in 4K though, which made it look pretty amazing. Also, I always forget Donald Glover was in this.\nSkyfall\nPerhaps one of the only movies to use a Land Rover Defender in a car chase, this is pure fun. The filming and action scenes were a wild step-up from the previous two films, and the stakes felt high throughout.\nQuantum of Solace\nFar less memorable than Casino Royale. The first chase was fun, but a lot of the rest of the film kinda just meanders. I do appreciate the little nods towards older James Bond films though.\nCasino Royale\nRewatching this in preparation for the eventual release of the final Daniel Craig bond film. It holds pretty well, save for the hilariously old-looking Sony phones and bootcut khakis. I’d forgotten Mads Mikkelsen was in this.\nContagion\nI saw this in the theater when it first came out, but I haven’t seen it since then. This felt like a timely movie considering our current circumstances. I forgot Jude Law plays a weird crank reporter.\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2020-03-31-march/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"march"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Made it home safely and started my California quarantine ","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-25-home-with-the-boy/","tags":["microblog"],"title":"Home with the boy"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about my time in Asakusa.\nLast day in Asakusa What was supposed to be my last day in Asakusa started late. The combination of tiredness and a very comfortable bed meant I slept in until 1pm. I played Animal Crossing for a while, then went to get ramen.\nLater, I headed to Kamakura to meet up with Craig Mod who showed me around his neighborhood, and chatted with me about the world, design, and reading. It really changes the nature of trips abroad when you have friends in various cities, I’ve found. I’m lucky to have a few friends scattered around Japan, so I’ve got a few mini-trips I can take each time I visit. Hopefully I’ll get to see Craig again in November for his writing retreat in Yoshino. I’m pretty excited to do a lot of hiking with him and the other participants.\nThat night, I said bye to Craig, then got ramen at a Michelin-starred spot in Kamakura, then headed back to Tokyo for some fried chicken and conbini chuhai. I caught up on tv, then got to bed on the early side.\nReal last day in Asakusa I woke up, packed, and got coffee downstairs. I took my time because I had to kill 6 or so hours until my flight home. A coworker (hi Ricky) met up with me at Fuglen in Asakusa to get coffee and chat about the state of the world for a while, and then I introduced him to the joy of Lemon Chuhais before we parted at the subway.\nAfter a brief misadventure at the wrong airline terminal, and some confusion about whether or not my flight was cancelled, I made it into the airline terminal, and found a window seat at the airline lounge. Shockingly, they had Georgian orange wine on tap, so I definitely enjoyed my last few hours before my flight.\nThe flight was bumpy as hell, but I managed to sleep for a bit.\nAnd now, I\u0026rsquo;m home\u0026hellip; quarantined like the rest of California.\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-24-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-five/","tags":["japan","travel"],"title":"Traveling During a Pandemic: Part Five"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about my time in Onomichi.\nYakitori party/焼き鳥のパーテイ After a drink at my hotel’s bar, I got a hot tip to check out a yakitori place a ten-minute walk away. I threw on my coat, and walked over, enjoying the peace and darkness of a city that actually sleeps.\nThe place was called 鳥徳 or Toritoku, and immediately on entering I was befriended by a Brazilian guy and his partner and their older math teacher friend. We talked for a while about tattoos, and drinking, and I mostly kept up in Japanese, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I stayed after they left, and then met a cadre of carpenters, including a very grateful American man named Jason (hi Jason!). The drinking continued as we cleared the place of all of its chicken bits, and all gotta a little cheerier and a little louder.\nFinally, around midnight, I left to walk home. Somehow I’d spent quite a bit of money, and was a bit more tipsy than I figured. When I got back to my hotel, I had the presence of mind to take a bath, and wash all my clothes, then throw a few things on the charger for the next day.\nI had an inkling I’d have a hangover\u0026hellip;\n二日酔い Ouch. I woke up with a wanging headache, and managed to get dressed and fill myself with the multi-course breakfast, including a very tall dairy-free pancake. I finished packing, then checked out of my hotel, quickly hopping on the phone with Chase to address my ticket issue and try to head back to the states earlier, in light of the US state department’s recommendation.\nCut to four hours later\nGood news: I started playing animal crossing Bad news: Chase never picked up (shakes fist at Chase Bank), and at the four hour mark, the call suddenly disconnected. What. The. Fuck.\nI gave up.\nI walked around for a while to find ramen and at least fill the hole in my stomach.\nBack to Tokyo Freshly full of karaage and ramen from a cute local shop, I hopped on the X train, followed by a trip on the Nozomi high-speed Shinkansen to Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, I spent the whole train trip playing Animal Crossing and trying to appease that bastard Tom Nook.\nAnimal Crossing interlude Animal Crossing was a favorite of mine in college on the GameCube, and each iteration is a simple joy. The Switch update is the best version yet, and looks gorgeous. If you’re the type of person who enjoys games like Harvest Moon, or just has a lot of time over the next few months while we’re all social distancing, I highly recommend picking this game up. Email or text me for my friend code so we can trade fruit, or whatever. My island is called Lesbos. So far we only have peaches on Lesbos, which is kind of a cliche, but oh well.\nAsakusa Found my hotel, and checked-in. There was art all over the place, including some from Frankie Cihi from Terrace House. Dinner was a chill diner meal of yakitori and some cucumber stuff while watching a weird 罰ゲーム (punishment game) tv show. I rounded out the night with Devs episode 4 and some Animal Crossing.\nDay two in Asakusa It was David’s birthday (hi David), so I woke up at 8:30am to play Animal Crossing with him and his pals. This continued through breakfast, where Haley (hi Haley) even visited my new island.\nLater, I went to Fuglen for coffee and was recognized from tv by a Kanae and her boyfriend. I read for a while over a tasty cup of Columbian coffee, then headed back to my hotel for some shochu. After a shiokoji shochu-induced nap, I headed to get onigiri from the oldest onigiri shop in Tokyo, Yadoroku. Wow. It was so, so good. Afterwards I wandered around and ran into my first 外国人を入れない on this trip. Dang.\nI ended up at a shop called 初代チョベリバ for a few drinks and chicken parts, then went home to read and watch tv.\nOverall, a pretty chill day.\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-22-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-four/","tags":["japan","travel"],"title":"Traveling during a pandemic: part four"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Before it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about my time in Osaka.\nHeading south Hopping on a call in the morning with Haley, Drl, and Zech was a nice way to start my last morning in Osaka. Background images were quickly swapped, and everyone was both upbeat, and a little stir-crazy. It felt nice to speak English a little, and hear about the bay and NYC.\nAfter packing up my stuff, I headed to Lawson for onigiri, then walked towards my go-to coffee shop. Sadly, it was closed for the morning, so I sat and read until I could grab some ramen. I briefly got a little lost near Osaka station, but eventually made my way to the Shinkansen to head to Fukuyama, then Onomichi.\nTransit is the scariest part of this trip.\nEvery year, the train journeys are one of my favorite part of coming to Japan, but this time, they feel a little more like steel-encased petri-dishes. The train to Fukuyama was busier than I thought it would be, and I sat next to a very quiet older woman for the 2 hour trip. I’d picked up some water and a lemon chuhai to keep me hydrated and chill during the trip, but since I was still reading Chuck Wendig’s Wanderers, I wasn’t exactly relaxed.\nTop Tip be careful not to read about plagues while you’re in the middle of one.\nA brief stop in Fukuyama meant a small cup sake, then a local train to Onomichi.\nOnomichi Wow. This town is gorgeous. I fully plan to come back here and spend more serious time when I’m able to in the future. I love the river that runs through the middle of town, and the winding hilly roads and stairs. I learned on my first night that this town is well known for cats. I’m sure somewhere in the back of my head, I’d seen this and taken note, but mostly I came here to stay at LOG and relax a little.\nMy first day was certainly relaxing after a hike up a hill to get to the hotel. I walked into the lobby sweating profusely and was offered oolong tea. After a brief tour I rested in my room and read. Later I took a long bath (I still can’t get over how wonderful Japanese bathtubs are—they actually fit my whole body), and then got a welcome drink at the bar.\nWow! They had natural wine from Alsace. Honestly LOG felt like a heaven—a retreat and a recharge from my worries. I hope more of you reading this are able to visit in the future, despite the nightly rate being a little steep (~$350 a night).\nDinner was a multi-course vegetable-focused feast with more white and whiskey to go with it. The small restaurant could seat 20, but only myself and two other women (a couple?) were there. It was utterly bizarre to be the only guests in a hotel.\nI chatted with the waiter and the other guests a little about food, drift-racing, and Slack.\nLater I read by my window, and listened to jazz.\nDay two I woke a little before my alarm and got ready for the day. My breakfast was served in the same small cafe as dinner, and included the best pancake I’ve had in years. The maple syrup was delightful and not to sweet, and there was coarse sea salt sprinkled over the top to balance the flavor.\nWhile my room was cleaned, I hung out in the library of the hotel with the windows open, despite the construction on the street outside. The sawing and jackhammering was somehow oddly soothing. I liked the idea that despite everything, this crew was still repairing a mountain path hundreds of years older than my own country.\nFrom what I’ve read, Onomichi was spared from bombing during the war, so many of the houses I see around are a very old style, with tiled roofs and small engawas. If it wasn’t for the electrical lines running overhead, my view from the library window would’ve seemed like time-travel.\nIt was gorgeous.\nCat hunting Later, I walked on the literature path all the way up to an observation point, and also visited the famous Tadao Ando-designed museum. I saw more than a few cats, but fellow was my favorite. We sat together for five minutes or so and appreciated the view.\nAll told I climbed 50 flights of steps during my hike. I only saw one other foreigner, but made sure to greet the older folks I walked past in the neighborhood with a cheerful 「こんにちは！」.\nThe museum had so much great cat art. I’m not a huge fine art lady, but even I enjoyed the 18th and 19th century Japanese paintings. It was pretty funny to see how white people were depicted in these paintings—all the bearded cello-playing weirdos from Holland and Portugal.\nI also saw a mini-museum to the maneki neko while on the short cat alley walk, and later visited a few temples.\nOverall, I loved the hike, and all the spectacular views of the city and the hills to the north and west of Onomichi.\nLunch and relaxing After a climb down the hill, I dropped by a 7\u0026frasl;11 to pick up cash, then got ramen at a shop that I think used beef lard in the stock. I’m unclear. It was called 牛ちゃん, but the ramen had tonkatsu, and I also got karaage, so who knows. It was tasty though, with a Hakata-style straight noodle.\nI made a fresh cup of Haiku-roasted Ethiopian coffee beans, and read for a while before exploring the city more for dinner.\nI knew I would be sad to leave this place on Friday.\nread part 1 or part 2\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-19-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-three/","tags":["travel","japan"],"title":"Traveling during a pandemic: part three"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Wow, things sure are quiet\u0026hellip;\nBefore it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor. Previously, I wrote about packing and my initial few days in Koenji in western Tokyo.\nOff to Kyoto Tokyo station and the Tokaido Shinkansen were both relatively empty, which was very odd to experience. If you’ve ever been to Japan, there’s a near-constant mass of people traveling via train stations, so I was both sad and glad to see folks taking none traveling seriously. I picked up an ekiben of box sushi and a chuhai, then headed to the old capital city for one night at BNA Alter Hotel, the Kyoto cousin of Koenji’s BNA.\nIn general, Kyoto was also much quieter, but had a slightly upbeat vibe and a bit more foot traffic than I saw in Tokyo. I think the smaller number of COVID cases meant Kyoto kept moving.\nI found some amazing yakitori for dinner and drank a few glasses of fancy whiskey later on back at my hotel. I watched Contagion before drifting off to sleep, and it unfortunately felt prescient. I hope we have more Matt Damons and less Gwyneth Paltrows in our current pandemic.\nDay two meant a solo breakfast at the hotel. There were only two of us there in the entire 31 room place. Wild.\nI went on a walk later, to get some air, and come coffee at Dongree, where I also sat alone. On the way to the train station I got ramen at an empty shop run by two older people who were very happy to have me. One downside of this spot—they didn’t have hand soap in the restroom. Fortunately, I was carrying alcohol wipes, but I made a note to find alcohol spray at the next conbini I visited.\nOsaka The train ride to Osaka was a little nerve-wracking. The small train got much more crowded than any other train I’d been on, and the asshole youth who sat next to me picked his nose under his mask and coughed into his mask for a few stops. The older woman sitting near us kept giving him the stink eye. Seriously, fuck that guy.\nI made it to my hotel a little early, and sat in the lobby before check-in. In a stark contrast to my huge room in Kyoto, the Nest hotel is a very tiny business hotel. I wasn’t really clear on the amenities when I booked it, but it’s basically a room large enough for a bed and a small chair. I spent most of the first night in my room, with a short excursion to get udon nearby. Later I watched Casino Royale, and had a canned highball. Truly high class, eh?\nEvery morning so far has meant catching up on the news around the world, practicing kanji, and trying to keep a little calm. I definitely felt more anxious in Osaka than in Koenji or Kyoto. Everyone outside seems much more blasé than other parts of Japan I’ve been to on this trip, despite the higher infection rate here.\nknocks on wood I hope this apparent nonchalance is fully warranted, and folks here will stay healthy.\nI got Vietnamese food in an empty restaurant with my friends Laurie and Stephan, and then got coffee at Haiku, a local spot I love. Later I took a leisurely walk, followed by a little chuhai purchasing at the Lawson. Having a beer in my hotel room isn’t as great as a nice whiskey out, but I figured it’s better safe than sorry.\nDay two meant a long walk after buying some onigiri at the Lawson. Crowds were sparse, but a surprising number of people were still walking around and playing baseball in the park. I’d just read about the shutdown in San Francisco, and Osaka felt like the opposite. I got more coffee at Haiku, and made sure to buy extra pourover bags to-go so I would have backup coffee for my time in Onomichi.\nI spent the afternoon back at my hotel, watching sim-racing championships and napping. Later I got karaage and more chuhai at Johnny’s, then walked back under the subway line, and listened to a podcast. I felt lucky in a way that I could still experience wandering around Osaka during this pandemic, but also scared for what lies ahead for my friends and our homes.\nLawsons came through with another chuhai for my tv-filled evening. First up was the finale of Avenue 5, and then Quantum of Solace. Uncomplicated action movies are a nice escape, I think.\nI set my alarm for a video call with my friend Haley, then headed to bed.\nread part 1 or part 3\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-17-traveling-during-a-pandemic-part-two/","tags":["travel","japan"],"title":"Traveling during a pandemic: part two"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Wow, things sure are quiet\u0026hellip;\nBefore it was clear we were headed for a pandemic, I booked a “treat yourself” trip to Japan. After a great first year at Slack, I wanted a nice non-work trip to really relax and refresh before going back into 2020 with a renewed sense of vigor.\nUnfortunately, in the following weeks COVID-19 grew at a wild rate, the cases in the United States were clearly skyrocketing despite a complete failure of the CDC and leadership to provide ample testing. My company cancelled business travel, but left it to us to determine our risk profile for personal travel, so I reached out to friends in the US and Japan to take stock. After a weekend of thinking and reading, I decided to travel to Japan unless flights were cancelled.\nThe trip begins Many travelers had clearly cancelled their flights, as the plane was largely empty. Out of caution and care for passengers, the staff of the JAL plane were all wearing masks, and taking extra measures to clean and prepare our plane as well. As I boarded and settled-in, my first thought was “I wish folks too health this seriously all the time”.\nOur flight was fairly bumpy, but I managed to sleep for a few hours, and even eat a bit before landing at HND. The usual self-service immigration booths were closed, but as one of the only visitors, I still made it through immigration and customs in minutes. As usual, the customs agent gave me an odd look for my small backpack and lack of luggage.\nThe bag This trip I brought a single bag: the Bellroy Studio in Venture Weave Black. After many trips with my RYU Quick Pack with a smaller day bag, I looked forward to a single light bag instead. So far on this trip, it’s been a comfortable bag, that easily hauls between locations. I haven’t used it very much outside of traveling to my hotels, as due to the virus I haven’t done a lot of writing from coffee shops or hiking. I used this bag daily for the past few months to go to work though, and am confident it would also be great to take a couple things with me to a coffee shop.\nMy packing list was pretty typical:\nClothes  1 pairs of Darn Tough wool socks 1 wool shirt from Icebreaker 1 pair of RekTrek pants from OV 1 Snow Peak FR trench 2 pairs of Negative underwear 1 sports bra 1 tank from Arcteryx 1 pair of shorts from Foxers  Electronics  iPad 11” Cellular Kindle Oasis Switch Lite Anker 10kmah battery Cables Satechi watch charger (got this for free from a Satechi rep. Thanks!)—short review: this is a little more compact and chill than bringing a watch cable, and can stick into the side of my iPad to let me charge while I’m writing. It’s a little more awkward plugged into a battery, but not too bad. It’s only 10 bucks more than an Apple charger so if you don’t have a travel charger this might be a good idea.  Other stuff  Hobonichi Weeks Kaweco fountain pen Toiletries in a Matador bag which so far, wow. I love this little bag.  I’m additionally wearing a duplicate of most of what I brought, save for the jacket and sleep clothes. I’m also testing out some new laundry soap while I’m here to see if it can keep my clothes fresh without needing a full in-shower scrub.\nKoenji social distancing My trip started in Koenji, where I stayed at my favorite BNA. By and large, I kept to my room, or did some socially-distanced hiking around Suginami. Lawson was a block away, and provided coffee and onigiri, but I also had coffees at Coffee AMP and INC near the train station. Honestly, other than mounting panic online, I found it to be relaxing to stick close to home. I went out for food a couple of times, but honestly felt a little afraid to go out. If I were in Oakland right now, it’s likely I wouldn’t have left the house this week at all, save for a walk around the block.\nTo be continued\u0026hellip; read part 2 or part 3\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-16-traveling-during-a-pandemic/","tags":["japan","backpacks","travel"],"title":"Traveling during a pandemic"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Welp, time to blast off into self-quarantine.\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-15-space-it-s-the-place-to-be/","tags":["microblog"],"title":"Space: it’s the place to be"},{"categories":null,"contents":"That big momo energy\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-03-12-micropost-2/","tags":["microblog"],"title":"Micropost 2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This book is great so far!

I watched a lot more movies this month than I read books, but that felt alright. Video games were also a theme, with lots of Witcher 3 and Dead Souls to keep me occupied. I also powered through a number of TV shows, like the Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan and the October Faction.\nBooks The Longing for Less — Kyle Chayka\nThis was far funnier than I expected, and also taught me a lot about a few areas of art and architecture I didn’t know about. A really informative and fun book.\nしろくまカフェ　1\n私のこれが最初日本語の漫画を読んだ。面白かったよ。次に谷崎の文学を読むww。\nOutline — Rachel Cusk\nThis was recommended to me, but I can’t say I loved it. The story here read more as a series of strange anecdotes, without a lot of core thread to grasp. There are two more books in this series, but I think I may pass on them.\nAgency — William Gibson\nA nearly present-day story of AI, art, and San Francisco. I really enjoyed this Peripheral sequel, though I think on the whole the fashion and strange web world of the previous trilogy was more my speed. I hope we get one more book with Netherton, Ash and company.\nMovies Jojo Rabbit\nA deeply strange film about learning how to be a person and unlearn fanaticism. There were some pretty excellent cameos in this, and a very dark comedic beat.\nPhantom Thread\nWow, this movie was hilarious from top to bottom. A friend (hi Drew) invited me to see it for the first time in 70mm, and all I want to do is channel Woodcock every day. \u0026ldquo;What am I supposed to do with that?\u0026rdquo;. What a joy. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to watch this again.\nFirst Love\nA strange mistaken gangster film. This was much more straightforward than many Takeshi Miike films, but still managed to add in some really bizarre bits, and even some surprises.\nElle\nYow. That was\u0026hellip; a lot of movie. Isabelle Huppert was fantastic, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I could recommend it. Definitely one of the stranger Verhoeven movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen.\nAnna\nAnother lady assassin movie. It was a helluva ride and I enjoyed it. I don’t think it added anything huge to the genre, but I’m just glad to have more cool movies about tough women. That said, I wish Anna had been able to just be with her girlfriend instead of randomly fucking spymasters.\nGennocidal Organ\nI read the book this movie is based on last year, and it’s a truly brutal story of linguistics and massive unrest. This movie is grim in a way that feels a little too prescient. Definitely one of the better anime thrillers I’ve seen in a while though.\nPsycho Pass Movie Trilogy\nAfter season 3, Psycho Pass had a trilogy of films in Japan. They’re fun continuations of the characters from all three seasons, and a bit of a sequel to the first movie. The future this film presents is pretty grim, but the animation is fantastic.\n","date":"March, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2020-03-01-february/","tags":["Media diet"],"title":"february"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The problem I\u0026rsquo;ve been on Twitter for over a decade, and found that lately it\u0026rsquo;s been more depressing and less enjoyable. I follow around five hundred people, of which I\u0026rsquo;d estimate 2-300 actively tweet every month. Because many of the users I follow are friends of mine I want to keep up with their lives and jokes, but that leads me to compulsively check my Twitter client of choice throughout the day on iOS and Mac. This habit distracts me from doing other things like being bored or curious. Really, I miss things I want to see and see ads instead.\nA test While I thought about my problem last weekend, I saw yet another friend swear off of the bird site for the month—I wondered if I could do the same. Would I miss it? Would I have trouble restraining myself from the twitch to launch the app and check in? Further, since a few writers post links to long-form writing on Twitter, might I actually miss some truly good stuff?\nRSS is my main avenue for reading longer-form articles, and keeping up with the news and tech news—what if I could also use RSS for a few important-to-me Twitter accounts? Twitter dropped official RSS support before most people even knew Twitter existed, so a native solution was out of the question. Fortunately, a friend in the #xoxo Slack pointed out that many RSS services handle this natively—including, it turned out, Feedbin.\nAs it says on the site: Feedbin is the best way to read Twitter. It\u0026rsquo;s even possible to only subscribe to media posts, or create and use a list of a few friends or publications.\nHow it went After one day this test already feels pretty great. I saw a few updates in my RSS reader whenever I felt like checking-in, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to scroll through ads and other random posts to find the gems. The design of my RSS solution was such that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t encouraged to mindlessly like posts, or respond with commentary—I could text or talk to folks in Slack instead.\nThere was a real twitch by the end of the first couple days, where I kept thinking, \u0026ldquo;launch Twitter and say something or read something,\u0026rdquo; but fortunately I held out.\nAs a solution for \u0026ldquo;where do I say random things?\u0026rdquo; I created a drafts doc in iAWriter where I put my weird ideas. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll blog some or post some in my newsletter in the future as a single roll-up of random Brook thoughts.\nWant to do the same? If this seems interesting to you, you\u0026rsquo;ll need three things:\n An RSS backend. I prefer Feedbin because it\u0026rsquo;s private by default and is actively developed. It costs $5 a month, but is outstanding. Easily this is one of the most dependable, useful services I pay for every month. An RSS app/reader. I prefer apps that work well across all the platforms I use: iPad OS, iOS, and MacOS. Reeder is made by a small shop, charges a small price for a very polished client with regular updates. Feedbin also has an app that is pretty great, and soon NetNewsWire will also have an iOS client. Try a few of these apps and see what suits your fancy. Twitter usernames you\u0026rsquo;d like to follow, or a list of those users. For this step, I highly recommend limiting yourself to users who tweet infrequently, or folks you absolutely love to read tweets from. Some folks are just joyful and funny, and I feel glad to see their updates whenever I check in. Other users are high-signal, but low frequency, so they\u0026rsquo;re also ideal for this experiment.  Also two books I recommend if you\u0026rsquo;re considering this and other ways that your life is made worse by a twitch to open things on your phone whenever life gets a little dull:\n Unsubscribe by Jocelyn Glei How to Break Up With Your Phone by Catherine Price  There\u0026rsquo;s a strong temptation to replace Twitter or other social networks with \u0026ldquo;productivity\u0026rdquo;, but in my opinion, this is a trap, and what we actually can do is leave space for creativity, boredom, and the world around us. Every minute of every day doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo;, and one doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to flit from activity to activity like a hummingbird with an MBA.\nFinally, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend Slacking, emailing, or texting anyone you\u0026rsquo;d like to \u0026ldquo;reply\u0026rdquo; to when you read something enjoyable. For a lot of folks, myself included, there\u0026rsquo;s a real community to Twitter on the best of days, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose touch with people I like on there, so reaching out, actually reaching out, might just work.\n","date":"February, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-02-22-a-twitter-experiment-using-rss-to-readonly-twitter/","tags":[""],"title":"A Twitter Experiment: Using RSS to read-only Twitter"},{"categories":null,"contents":" 2020 began in earnest, and despite it being winter, in the Bay Area it’s delightfully sunny. I spent the first week largely sitting by the window of my apartment, reading and studying Japanese. So far, I really enjoy the slower pace of this decade.\nBooks Mainline — Deborah Christiansen\nA fun throwback to the world of cyber decks and assassins. I wish I’d found this in 1996, but it holds up well. The plot got a little convoluted, but supposedly there’s a very recent sequel, so perhaps there will be payoff.\nUncanny Valley — Anna Weiner\nAh, the tech industry. I’ve been working in this world for over a decade and this book felt like a survey of it. I know a few people mentioned in the chapters, and am unfortunately very familiar with many of the events. I think Weiner did a great job of capturing the constant, weird feeling of trying to survive and often getting lost in the self-satisfied world of tech founders and “disruption”.\nThrone of Glass — Sarah J. Maas\nI was drawn to this book by the front cover and the vague notion that it might be like Gideon the Ninth. It’s not exactly super different, but it’s clearly YA, where Gideon is not. I may continue the series, as it was decently compelling, but I wish it were more genre and less youth.\nUnsubscribe — Jocelyn Glei\nAlthough this book is deep in the details of email, most of it applies just as well to Slack and other forms of messaging. I appreciate her approach to mindful work, as well as how she thinks about the problems of people and communication. A worthwhile read, especially if you struggle with a mountain of other people’s problems\nThe Walking Man — Jiro Taniguchi\nThe art in this manga is gorgeous. I especially love the way the leaves and grass are drawn. The stories are largely dialogue-less vignettes that meander through cities and the countryside, taking it all in. When I open this book, I wish I were in Japan again, following stray cats around town.\nEmily Eternal — M.G. Wheaton\nThis is an interesting take on apocalyptic fiction. With an AI protagonist and a dying sun, the story careens across the Americas and then even further. There’s a strange love story I didn’t care much for, but otherwise this was a nice romp.\nMovies Weathering with You\nI found out I don’t need to worry about climate change because it’s just rain, ya know? This film was gorgeous and fun and o loved the cat in it with my entire heart.\nMatrix: Reloaded\nReally starting the year off right. We talked through most of the exposition, which was like 75% of the movie. I hadn’t seen this since it came out, and it really didn’t hold up.\nThe Lighthouse\nThe first thing I noticed in this film was the tight, constrained feel of a square frame with deep black and white images. I immediately had to look around for how this was made. The VVitch is one of my favorite movies of all time, and Eggers doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint in this haunting film either. The dread builds as the antipathy between the two men grows. A joy.\n","date":"January, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2020-01-30-media-diet-for-january/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"january"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The first time When Halt \u0026amp; Catch Fire first aired, I was lucky enough to clue in and watch it weekly on AMC. As a Texan with a dad who occasionally worked in or at least around tech, and then joined the industry myself, it captured the world I grew up in incredibly well. Starting out a little rough, it became a show all about family and how ambition can destroy everything. H\u0026amp;CF remains one of my favorite shows of all time, and despite it being entirely too emotionally intense to watch again before now, I happily tuned back in this past fall.\nA rewatch begins I\u0026rsquo;d almost forgotten how hopeful the show began. Joe, Cameron, Donna, Boz, and Gordon all dove in and ended up going to an early CES—when AVN still happened next door. As I write this, CES is happening again in Vegas, but the dreams are smaller and the concepts more far-fetched. In the 80s of this show, the world was about to change completely. We follow a company at the time of IBM\u0026rsquo;s dominance, with a parallel but less successful track than Apple. Word processors barely existed, and computers weighed 30lbs.\nWhat so quickly began as a dream to make the future of computing turned into just making another IBM clone. What stuck with me in this first season was the crushing sadness of mediocre money. When I watched season one, I was a younger woman with a lot of dreams. Five years later, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a fair amount of failure, and some great success. I work for an amazing company after our Mutiny petered-out. Unlike the Cardiff Electronics or McMillain Utility of H\u0026amp;CF, my next adventure is delightful.\nI still haven\u0026rsquo;t seen another show that so fully captures how difficult it is to build something with the folks you love or how much it hurts to lose them. With a second watch, I brought my feelings and memories of all of the ups and downs, which compounded each wave. Everyone was so young. It felt like this show was about adults when I first saw it, but now they seem like me or even younger. This realization helped me have more compassion for the idiocy and backstabbing as I watched. Before I saw a thoughtless jerk, and now I saw the pain of making tough decisions. When I first watched this show, I had just moved to Portland, Oregon, and now that I\u0026rsquo;m watching it for a second time, I\u0026rsquo;m in the bay—the setting for most of the show. I see many of the backdrops that Joe and Donna see on a daily basis, and it really makes the show come alive.\nA queer angle From the first time I saw him on Pushing Daisies, I had a feeling Lee Pace was on my team. Last year in the NY Times, he confirmed it. H\u0026amp;CF showed a brief glimpse of the AIDs crisis, and one fleeting queer party at Joe\u0026rsquo;s house. I wish they\u0026rsquo;d let written the show with more queer characters, or done more too how the struggle of gay men in the 80s and 90s, but even these little bits were more than I ever expected from a show about tech. I hope one day a story like this can have queer and trans women too.\nDonna and Cameron By the second season, it seems like the show runners had the same revelation many of my friends watching the show for the first time have: this show is better when it\u0026rsquo;s about Donna and Cameron. The tensions between them, and the challenges of their friendship are the lifeblood of the show. Cameron needs Donna\u0026rsquo;s stability, and Donna wants the respect that everyone has for Cameron\u0026rsquo;s abilities. As Mutiny struggles, and Swap Meet kicks off the tensions almost destroy them, but by the end of the show, they\u0026rsquo;re ready to trust again. Their love and sisterhood are often sad, but ultimately an inspiring look at how two women can go beyond a competition to something lasting.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t seen Kerry Bishé in much since H\u0026amp;CF, but it seems like she\u0026rsquo;s been busy with big film projects. Meanwhile, Mackenzie Davis was in an incredible episode of Black Mirror, the upcoming adaptation of Station Eleven, and the ridiculous new Terminator film. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they\u0026rsquo;ll ever work together again, but they were incredible together in this show.\nThe tech Most of the first few seasons were populated with technology I never got to use as a kid, save for the Apple IIe, but by the third season I saw myself in Donna and Gordon\u0026rsquo;s daughter\u0026rsquo;s eagerly waiting for a chance to play the NES. My parents used to bogart Super Mario Brothers just like Cameron and Gordon did as they played it on their new projection screen. My dad was never a HAM radio guy, but the single-minded love of hobbies mirrored Gordon\u0026rsquo;s. I remember Lotus software, and the rise of laser tag, the thrill of dialing-up to the burgeoning world-wide web. I wish anyone on this show had learned how to touch-type.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t fondly remember the rise of security software, but hey, neither did the show. Watching this show, I saw myself as a kid around with a big set of headphones over my head, and a walkman on my belt. Those were the days. The community of Mutiny was what I found eventually on forums and in queer chat rooms and that too fly true in this show. I even love some of the cars—RIP Joe\u0026rsquo;s 944.\nHalt and Catch Fire is incredible This rewatch was inspired by a newsletter I read, wherein the writer is afraid to finish the show completely. I understand this feeling completely, as I find myself slowing down while I watch in order to savor every episode. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably rewatch this show a few more times this decade, and I can only hope someone else one day makes a show I\u0026rsquo;ll love as much as this one.\n","date":"January, 2020","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-01-09-rewatching-halt-catch-fire/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"Rewatching Halt \u0026 Catch Fire"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Out of 74 movies, I wanted to pick a few that really stood out, and then talk briefly about a few that I really didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy. I went to the theater quite a bit this year, as I live pretty close to one with couch-seats and luckily have a few film-buddies to meet up with. Other films that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to see while they were on the big screen were rented at home or watched through a myriad of streaming services I\u0026rsquo;ve accrued over the years.\nThe List In no particular order, here are ten films that really stood out to me.\n‌Uncut Gems\nA real delight of failure and crushed dreams.\nShoplifters\nA family of criminals gets to be perfectly human.\nDestroyer\nNicole Kidman is a badass drunk detective.\nUs\nUnder the boarrrrddddwalk. Boardwalk.\nArctic\nCompetence porn.\nMidsommar\nThe best breakup film ever.\nThe Farewell\nI cried quite a bit—major family feelings.\nFirst Reformed\nThe world is getting hotter, and Ethan Hawke is too, inexplicably.\nBooksmart\nCool buddy comedy with a talented younger cast.\nParasite\nEat the rich.\nHonorable mention: Ford Vs. Ferrari.\nThe Bad Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker\nLook, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spoil this for anyone who cares, but has somehow not seen the film yet. I was super disappointed in how the series ended, and what a raw deal Rose got. Did we need yet another droid? It\u0026rsquo;s particularly sad that with the Mandolorian really succeeding as a tv show, this is the pap we get in theaters. Demi is better at tearing this apart than I am.\nPredator\nWow. Even as a fan of crap action films, this was a letdown.\nHobbes \u0026amp; Shaw\nListen, I love the Fast \u0026amp; Furious series like a warm blanket—it has cars, explosions, family, and little-to-no-complexity. Some of that was still present in this film, but they managed to hamstring the only female protagonist, and replace all the joy with ball jokes.\nWandering Earth\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why I expected this to be great, but it was just hokey as hell.\nAvengers: Endgame\nI know, right? I hated the new Star Wars and the end of the Avenger\u0026rsquo;s duology? I\u0026rsquo;m obviously a monster. Unfortunately, this movie was much like Rise of Skywalker in that it mistook random scenes of characters folks recognize for a plot or joy. It takes more than seeing Spider-Man appear on screen for me to be excited these days—just look at the incredible Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse for tips on how to do this well. I think some plot lines do better in multiple comics, and not on the silver screen. Smaller, more fun superhero films in 2020, please.\n2019 streaming Wow, 2019 was a great year for films! If you want to read longer reviews of the above films, visit my movies page. I didn\u0026rsquo;t set out to watch more films this year, but with Amazon Prime, Criterion, Kanopy, iTunes, and Netflix, it was super easy to watch most of the stuff I wanted to see. I finally upgraded to a 4K TV and 4K Apple TV too, so I will likely watch even more things at my house without trekking to the land of empty cola machines and questionable curly fries.\n2020 Looking towards next year, the films I\u0026rsquo;m currently most excited about are:\nA Promising Young Woman\nRevenge films? Yes please.\nNew Mutants\nOne of the coolest X-Men teams ever, in the theater.\nNo Time to Die\nI honestly love James Bond films, and I can\u0026rsquo;t pretend otherwise.\nMonster Hunter\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why I love Resident Evil movies so much, but the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson has moved to a new video game adaptation has me stoked.\nDune\nThe David Lynch version of Dune, in all of its weirdness, was one of the movies I watched on repeat as a child. I know, that explains a lot, right? I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the subject matter.

I loved for narrator and the strange poetic style of storytelling. I read this in two sittings and was enraptured.\nDead Astronauts — Jeff Vandermeer\nThis book did some interesting things with time, and some deeply annoying things with text. I feel like I know what he was doing with this book largely, and support his environmental aims (a+ murderous blue fox), but it never really came together for me.\nInterference — Sue Burke\nA fun follow-up to a great book from last year. I loved seeing how modern Earth folks mixed with the people on the rainbow bamboo planet. I was surprised to find that we only followed a single generation of characters this time, but I did enjoy how they were more fleshed-out.\nThis is How You Lose the Time War — Amal el-Mohtar and Max Gladstone\nA deeply strange time-travel romance between two competing spies, Blue and Red. The central conceit of shifting threads of history and letter-leaving was fun, but at times I honestly had no idea what was going on. I really enjoyed this book.\nMovies Ford vs. Ferrari\nA blast! I love car racing so much, and this film was a gorgeous vision of a famous showdown between an incredible car company, and Ford. I grew up hearing stories about Shelby, and this film brought him to life.\nUncut Gems\nThis was wild! From front to back this movie was a rollercoaster of poor decision-making and the world of vigs, 3 way parlay, and Kevin Garnet. Adam Sandler showed that he could really act in Punch Drunk Love, and he absolutely owns in Uncut Gems.\nOne Cut of the Dead\nWithout spoiling it, all I’ll say is this film went to fun places I didn’t expect, and was a delight throughout.\nPsycho Pass\nThe episodes of this show already feel fairly cinematic, so stretching the show to nearly 2 hours felt right. It was super jarring to hear random English throughout the film though—at the start I thought I was accidentally watching a dub.\nStar Wars: Rise of Skywalker\nFrankly this post from Film Critic Hulk covered my feelings well. I described it as a movie trying to fellate itself. Scenes rarely got to breathe, and the movie felt packed with fan service and confusing backtracking from Last Jedi. Also wow, they just dropped a bunch of character storylines.\nAd Astra\nSpace Brad Pitt! We’ve sent most leading men to space, but never Pitt (I didn’t check this too carefully). Also this had Donald Sutherland, who is a personal favorite. I appreciate that none of the things in space made sound at least. Sad dads in space. It was pretty, and exciting, but ultimately didn’t really give me much to latch onto.\nReady or Not\nLol can\u0026rsquo;t wait to never get remarried. Rich people are the worst. Also it\u0026rsquo;s a real bummer that \u0026ldquo;satanists\u0026rdquo; get such a bad wrap in a world where the christians are the ones actually harming children.

In July, I began sending weekly link emails, which I managed to keep up through the end of the year. It\u0026rsquo;s been quite a fun Sunday activity, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d chat a bit about what the experience of weekly link writing was like.\nWhy links? This year I got really stoked about Robin Sloan\u0026rsquo;s Year of the Meteor newsletter, which was full of incredible links that led me to read quite a bit, and even change my deodorant brand. Robin consistently finds interesting and strange things all over the web, and I thought, perhaps I could do the same. I struggle to find writing topics at times, but I still journal daily, and try to keep up a writing practice during the fallow uninspired periods. A weekly newsletter seemed like an excellent idea, but I tend to write less, and not more.\nA brief digression I\u0026rsquo;ve found that writers are usually in one of two camps: the underwriters, and the overwriters. As a member of the former camp, I can crank out 1-2000 words in no time, but asking me to go beyond that is a torture, whereas my overwriting friends tend to need an editor to get down to 2000. Because of this the idea of writing a novel, or even a longish short story is really hard to consider—but short creative nonfiction? Hell yes.\nOk, back to the links Having realized I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to creatively write every week without a good prompt, I settled on looking around the web through the week, and sending my baubles to you, the reader, on Sundays. I settled on Sunday because it felt like a good time to have coffee and enjoy a little surfing around. Perhaps you do this reading on another day, but for me, Sundays are for coffee and words.\nFinding links The links I share come from all over the place. Sometimes I reshare things I found in another newsletter, like Dense Discovery, and other times, they come from my long list of RSS feeds (feel free to request my OPML file). I read quite a bit every day, both on and offline, so it really isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to find a few tidbits to share.\nThe satisfaction of analytics I don\u0026rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about how many readers I\u0026rsquo;ve accused (spoiler, not many), but I do love that I can see that folks generally are reading the emails I send out. There\u0026rsquo;s a small sense of accomplishment when I know that someone has found something neat because I shared it. I really do love a recommendation, and it seems like some of you do as well.\nPlatforms This year began on Substack, which seems like a decent platform, and has attracted more than a few friends as users. As someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t really planning to find success or payment via a newsletter, my main goals were something easy to use, and ideally something I could send content to directly from iAWriter, my markdown editor of choice.\nWith that in mind, I was eager to switch to ButtonDown after reading about it via Robin Sloan. I love how both the roadmap and costs are fully public, and the developer responds really quickly via email. This small, sustainable app is something I\u0026rsquo;m really keen on supporting, as I love sustainable apps much more than venture-funded privacy-less hockey-stick comapnies. Plus using Working Copy and Shortcuts, I managed to build on top of their really easy to use API, and now have a one-button send draft to ButtonDown\nNext year My plan currently is to just keep on keeping on with this weekly links newsletter, and aspire to continuing monthly blog posts about longer topics. If you have things you\u0026rsquo;d love to see, or things you want to chat about, you know how to reach me.\nHave a fantastic new year, and I\u0026rsquo;ll see you next Sunday!\n","date":"December, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-30-what-i-learned-from-sending-a-newsletter-this-year/","tags":["process"],"title":"What I learned from sending a newsletter this year"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This year I read 55 books and a lot of graphic novels.

My plan to keep reading primarily female authors also paid off.\nIn no particular order, here’s the list:\n The Starless Sea — Erin Morgenstern\nHer first book was great, her second was outstanding.\n The Future of Another Timeline — Annalee Newitz\nIt’s wild that two of my favorite books this year came out near the end of the year. Newitz created a fascinating time-travel technology, with an amazing world. Here’s to the Daughters of Harriet.\n The Psychology of Time Travel — Kate Mascarenhas\nMore queer time travel? Hell yes.\n Gideon the Ninth — Tamsyn Muir\nLesbian necromancers in space. Ok, there’s a theme to most of these and it’s around queer ladies and space or time-travel. I’m here for it, and so glad the whole zombie thing is over.\n Noumenon — Marina J. Lostetter\nMulti-generational spaced exploration? Yes, please.\n  I did more full-fledged reviews for each of these in the link at the start of this post, though as always my book and film reviews are short because I got my fill of analytical book essays in college.\nStand-out comics  The whole X-Men relaunch! From Powers of X/House of X to the weekly series like X-Force, I’m stoked to be enjoying the X-Men again. Paper Girls \u0026amp; Wicked and Divine: These two series finished strong, and I’m excited to read through them again sometime. Die! An amazing series that’s just kicking off. This feels like a fresh take on D\u0026amp;D, so I’ll be glad to read more. Shirokuma Cafe: the first series I can actually read in Japanese! This feels huge.  Kindle Oasis This year I read a few physical books, but by and large I read on my Kindle Oasis. In addition to being great for bathtub reading (hi Japan), the one-handed reading makes laying in bed super comfortable. Plus, I’ve found the Kindle to be a pretty solid place to read manga. I still hope that Amazon actually pushes the envelope on these at some point, but until then, I’ll hold onto this one. If you want to think more about ebooks, this is a great essay.\n2020 There are quite a few books in my queue for 2020, and I’m especially excited about a new William Gibson novel! I’ll likely travel a bit more, and as I start to finish up my big kanji learning project, I’ll be able to read more in Japanese as well.\n","date":"December, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-16-my-favorite-books-of-2019/","tags":["books"],"title":"My Favorite Books of 2019"},{"categories":null,"contents":" A new backpack for everyday carry, and travel.\nFirst Sight After first getting my new Bellroy sling, I fell in love with the delightful material for these bags. A few months later in Iitoya in Japan, I got to see their new Shift backpack in person, and almost bought one on the spot. that bag was a little larger than I need, but then I saw this. With the launch of the Studio Backpack, Bellroy has made an excellent bag that holds a little or a lot without every looking absurd.\nSizing For quite a while, I’ve brought my Topo Trip Pack to work as it fits my coffee bottle, iPad, journal, and a few other things perfectly. Adding in a spare jacket could stuff it pretty tight, but I preferred that to hauling a bag that was typically too large. With the Studio Backpack, my everyday stuff fits well, with ample space, but the shallow depth of the bag means it looks nice even unloaded.\nMeasurements This is a slim, but tall-ish bag that measures 500L x 370W x 100D mm or 19.69”x14.57”x3.94”.\nIt has an 18-liter capacity, which while entry isn’t nearly as big feeling as my similarly-sized RYU Quick Pack. It weighs 650g or 1.43lbs, nearly half the weight of the RYU, and only a little heavier than the 567g Topo Trip Pack.\nAll-in-all, this bag feels like a great balance between a daily size and one that I could fly around the world with.\nFeatures This bag is a top-loader, with a generously-wide opening, and a fidlock magnetic closure I can open with one hand using the small fabric loop. This flap makes for an easy way to use the main compartment, while keeping the rain off of my stuff. On the outside, there’s a pocket a little bit lower than mid-way that zips shut, and has pockets for pens, AirPods, and a few other things along with a key loop on a long fabric loop. Usually, I keep a Hobonichi Weeks, a Kaweco fountain pen, house keys, AirPods Pro and my work badge in here.\nInside of the main bag area, there’s a laptop area that can hold up to a 16” MacBook Pro—the new one with the real escape key—or an iPad Pro of either size. The bottom of the bag is generously padded to keep your stuff safe, and the laptop sleeve ends before the bottom for more safety. On the front wall of the main bag opening there is another zipped compartment for glasses, cables, or other odds and ends that you don’t need as often.\nColors and Materials I have the black version of this bag, which I find delightful, though if I could customize it, I might have chosen a light purple or blue interior instead of the tan it comes with from Bellroy. Bellroy won me over on the idea that a lighter or brighter interior helps in finding your gear, though as a top-loader, even bright fabric doesn’t help you dig at the bottom of the bag. The Venture Weave fabric feels very strange, but in a cool, high-end way, and does a good job shrugging off rain. There are leather accents in various places on the bag that give it a little extra luxury.\nRating This bag rules, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it for the past few weeks. I plan to take it on my next trip abroad, and likely won’t bring a separate daypack. I think this bag will be comfortable on a hike, or fully-loaded with my typical travel gear. If you need a bit more space, I highly recommend checking out Bellroy’s other larger version of this, the Shift pack.\n","date":"December, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-12-13-bellroy-studio-pack-review/","tags":["backpacks","reviews"],"title":"Bellroy Studio Pack Review"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" It’s finally chilly hygge-weather in the Bay Area, so I’ve been reading a lot after returning from a long trip to Japan. I hope wherever you are, you’re warm and feel loved.\nBooks The Starless Sea \u0026ndash; Erin Morgenstern\nI read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea. This is a book for those of us who love exploring, and digging into a fantastical tale.\nThe Infinite Wait \u0026ndash; Julia Wertz\nMy friend Jenny recommended this one a while ago, and I finally got around to reading it. I couldn’t put it down. It’s hilarious, sad, and very close to home. I’d never heard of Wertz until now, but I plan to immediately buy all her comics.\nThe Future of Another Timeline — Annalee Newitz\nWow. This book was a triumph, and seriously seals Newitz as a scifi master. I only wish I could explore this world for longer. A perfect blend of history, speculation, and feminism—this book imagines a world in which collective action is possible deep into the past. Dang.\nHow to Do Nothing — Jenny Odell\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;ve finally finished her book, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the self-help palp that so many books about your phone are, but instead a wildly revelatory piece on bioregionalism, art, mystery, and birds. So many cool birds. This is a book I had to sip, because every few pages were full of so many ideas I wanted to savor them. I learned quite a bit from Jenny in these pages, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if it takes you a while to read this, just buy a copy and meander through California through it.\nShadow and Bone — Leigh Bardugo\nThis was a neat YA that ended far before I thought it would—my edition had almost 100 pages of previews after the book. I enjoyed the magic system, despite the unfortunate teen romance that tends to plague YA. I\u0026rsquo;ll likely read more of this series, in hopes that it continues to build a cool world.\nMovies Knives Out\nSadly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling great so I missed a bit of this, but I think I got all the important bits. I really want to see this again in the near future. The overall tone of the film was fantastic, and the comedic hits were delightful.\nFast Color\nThe preview of this movie had me hoping it was a potential adaptation of NK Jeminson\u0026rsquo;s Broken Earth trilogy, but alas, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. Fortunately, it was still a fun movie about family and mutant powers. I wish there was a little more substance to the whole film, but on the upside, the mood was pretty interesting. Also it\u0026rsquo;s weird seeing a belter as a sheriff (please see the Expanse for more details).\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives\nI’ve had this on my to-watch list for years, and finally decided to dive in. It was a beautiful and strange mediation on life, death, and family.\nTerminator: Dark Fate\nA nice return to form. This felt like a nice natural extension to Terminator 2, and while it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a great film by any means, it was a fun romp with lots of goofy jokes, explosions, and Mackenzie Davis.\nEdge of Tomorrow\nThis was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the Incomparables. I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.\n","date":"November, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-11-30-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"november"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Another year has rushed past, and with it, another iPhone update and some changes to my phone since last year\u0026rsquo;s setup. My use of a single screen of apps continues, with a few major and minor changes alongside.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve posted these for the past few years, so if you want to see what apps I was using in 2017, here you go.\nSome things change 3 app dock—I moved my Twitter app out of my dock in order to spend less time on Twitter. I figured if I wanted to to launch it I could easily search for it, but perhaps by having it out of reach I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t launch the app out of habit or boredom. This worked pretty well.\nFantastical—Last year I said \u0026ldquo;This is definitely the app I am most interested in replacing.\u0026rdquo; I replaced it with iOS Calendar not too long after writing this post because of the cleaner look, date view icon, and a better visualization of my next meeting on my phone and watch. I also really hate how Fantastical uses space on the iPad. I still hope that someday Apple opens up the ability to change icons based on events or time, but until they do, I\u0026rsquo;ll have a hard time moving away from the default calendar.\nBear—I moved completely off of Bear in favor of iAWriter, largely due to Working Copy, which is an excellent Git client for iOS devices, and means I can use iAWriter\u0026rsquo;s file function to open up posts like this one that live in my personal blog\u0026rsquo;s Drafts folder.\nGoogle Maps—I moved back to Apple Maps. In general Apple Maps got a lot better, and works better on my watch. Also, in Japan, Apple Maps often shows results from TabeLog, which tends to have much better local recommendations.\nTweetbot—I replaced this with the weird beta Twitter app twttr. It\u0026rsquo;s hidden in a folder now to encourage me to not use it as often, and that is working pretty well.\nFiery Feeds—*Reeder 4 came out* and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing. I moved to Reeder 4 on all of my devices, and I love it. The read later feature has also replaced Safari\u0026rsquo;s read later for me in all instances. I don\u0026rsquo;t use Bionic reading, but it\u0026rsquo;s a neat feature regardless. I continue to use Feedbin to back my RSS.\nSome things stay the same Overcast — Overcast is great. This year it just got better, from CarPlay, to the watch, to my phone. I am really excited for Marco to update for more Airplay 2 features as he mentioned in a recent episode of ATP. There are other podcast apps out there, but for smart-speed, playlists, and everything else, there is only Overcast.\nSpark—I kept using Spark this year, especially as they updated for a great black-screened-OLED-friendly dark mode, and rethought their entire interface in 2.5. This is a great email app on all my devices, and has fantastic keyboard support for iPadOS.\nApple Music—I\u0026rsquo;ve barely opened Spotify all year. Apple Music keeps getting better, and it seems like more of my friends have moved over to it as well.\nThings—This app is how I keep track of all my work and personal tasks. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible. Keyboard shortcuts are available on iOS and Mac, and in general this app is a great example of how a cross-platform app should function.\nApple Photos—This app got a lot better in iOS 13, and I really enjoy it. Not much else to say.\nSlack—I work at Slack still, and it\u0026rsquo;s still a great app.\nSingle folder—65 extra apps live in this folder. They range from rarely-used travel apps for work, to translation apps, to video and banking apps. I don\u0026rsquo;t love all of the apps in this folder, but I regularly go through them to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re still needed.\nThe best of the rest A few of the apps that live inside my large catch-all folder and are opened via search.\nWorking Copy—This app is amazing. In addition to functioning as a great Git tool, it also has syntax and code-highlighting for tons of languages. I don\u0026rsquo;t work in Working Copy all the time, but when I\u0026rsquo;m iPad-only, I use it quite a bit for work and my personal projects.\nGoogle Fi—I moved to Google Fi last year from AT\u0026amp;T largely due to the free and easy international roaming. It\u0026rsquo;s great.\nTsurukame—This is my daily second job. I spend around two hours a day in this app and reading in order to become fully literate in Japanese. As I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m at level 39, and have over 1300 Kanji above Guru level. Learning Japanese is super hard, but worth it.\nPlex—Lots of video sources live here. It\u0026rsquo;s a great app, and I wish other video streaming services would learn from Plex\u0026rsquo;s great example.\n1Password—All my passwords live here, and are super long and complex. Similar to Things, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I could work the same way without 1Password.\nWrap-up Last year I suggested my list of apps might not shift much, but five of my major home screen apps changed due to updates and simplicity. I\u0026rsquo;m happy this year with the apps that I use and due to my requirements of quality Apple Watch, Mac, and iPadOS cross-platform functionality the bar is really high for other apps to knock these off of my phone. I\u0026rsquo;m very excited about iOS 14, especially with news that it might be more stable than the particularly rough iOS 13 release. Perhaps Apple will give more features to devs that unlock unimagined new functionality. We\u0026rsquo;ll find out in 6 months.\n","date":"November, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-28-2019-iphone-homescreen/","tags":["iPhone","homescreen"],"title":"2019 iOS Homescreen"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" The Playlist Here\u0026rsquo;s all the albums I really loved this year easily accessible as an Apple Playlist.\nThe Albums 1) Cheap Queen — King Princess\nBless lesbian musicians. King Princess first caught my attention with the song Pussy is God, which damn. This album is a bop.\n2) Emily Alone — Florist\nA deeply sparse, sad album that I enjoy quite a bit. Florist has always made beautiful songs, but this is a so quiet and so delightful.\n3) Interloper — Momma\nJust the right amount of harmonies and hooks to draw you into a strange and fun indie rock band.\n4) Family Tree — Oh Land\nA gorgeous album from a Danish former dancer. I just love her voice—from the start the album has a haunting beauty.\n5) Scholars — Buke \u0026amp; Gase\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had every album Buke \u0026amp; Gase put out on repeat for some time after their release, and dearly love their jangly, angular rock. This album doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint.\n6) Beast on Beast — Gabby\u0026rsquo;s World\nThis is the first band I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to that has gone through three name changes, from Eskimeaux, to Ó, then finally Gabby\u0026rsquo;s World. I\u0026rsquo;ve loved them the whole time, and find this to be especially good sad subway music for when you\u0026rsquo;re a little bummed and riding home at night.\n7) Placeholder — Hand Habits\nA complex jam album with fantastic guitars and vocals weaving in and out of downtempo songs.\n8) Memory Streams — Portico Quartet\nI first heard this band at a vinyl bar in Oakland, and their latest album rules.\n9) Trust In The Lifeforce Of The Deep Mystery — The Comet Is Coming\nFantastic end of the world music. This is really strange, funky jazz, and I dig it. Many mornings start off with this album and some coffee.\n10) Nowhere Now Here — MONO\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been stoked on MONO since high school, and was lucky enough to see them perform many times at Emo\u0026rsquo;s (RIP) in Austin. They just keep on making fantastic music that vacillates softer beautiful sounds and driving melodies. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re walking around the city or taking a train to another city, this album creates a gorgeous soundtrack for your life.\n11) Patience — Manequin Pussy\nA chill mix of punk and indie rock jams. I think I first saw this band at a show/benefit for Bernie Sanders that I didn’t know was a benefit. It was a super washed crowd, but Manequin Pussy owned bones. This record rules.\n12) Crush on Me — Sir Babygirl\nI’m really enjoying the new influx of queer and lesbian pop music these days. This album is infectiously catchy and often hilarious. Put it on and enjoy the short bouts of sun this winter.\n13) Miss Universe — Nilüfer Yanya\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to describe this album, but it\u0026rsquo;s a jam. A bit of r\u0026amp;b, a bit of indie rock, and a lot of really solid tunes. I\u0026rsquo;ve put this album on a repeat a few times this year.\n14) Hifalutin — Lowly\nSuper dance-y-yet-downtempo album. I can throw this on for a variety of moods, and it seems to always suit them. There’s something about Denmark that must inspire people to make brilliant music—this album was recorded in a small warehouse near Aarhus.\n15) Weird — Juliana Hatfield\nOh hey, an album that feels like I do sometimes: “I\u0026rsquo;m staying in/My hair’s not right/And if I go out/Somebody might Take me for a functioning/Human being”. I’m sure I heard Hatfield before this album, but this is the one where she came together for me as an artist.\n16) Fibs — Anna Meredith\nThis album is a solid jam. Anna Meredith\u0026rsquo;s compositions feel important, weird, and powerful. I often listen to this album in the morning to wake up and feel better about the day.\n17) Four of Arrows — Great Grandpa\nFor a sophmore effort this is a really fun, mature album. I like that they\u0026rsquo;ve moved from more straightforward poppy indie music to a little more melodic rock.\n18) Two Hands — Big Thief\nHonestly, the fact that Big Thief put out two incredible albums this year is wild to me. I love both of their 2019 records, but Two Hands especially keeps going back on the stereo. It\u0026rsquo;s gorgeous. Jia Tolentino wrote about them recently, and I recommend reading her piece.\n19) Any Human Friend — Marika Hackman\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got BDE/I think it\u0026rsquo;s a venereal disease\u0026rdquo;. Ugh. This album is an instant lesbian classic. I\u0026rsquo;ve loved every album Hackman has put out, with That Iron Taste immediately pulling me in, and constantly being on rotation. I got to see her perform in Portland a few years back, and the show was outstanding. Between her soft vocal delivery, which whispers with poetry and sensuality, and the brutally raw lyrical content\u0026hellip; just wow.\n20) Lost Wisdom Pt. — Mount Eerie\nAfter the utter devastation of his past two albums, this truly sad album about an impending divorce with beautiful guest vocals from Julie Doiron almost comes as a relief. This is a tragedy I can almost understand, feelings I have felt. Microphones and Mount Eerie have held me through many hard times, and this album is an excellent entry into their discography.\n","date":"November, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-26-favorite-albums-2019/","tags":["music"],"title":"Favorite Albums of 2019"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" As usual, when I go on a DevRel tour, I like to write about what I\u0026rsquo;ve packed. This trip was a 3 week journey from Tokyo, through Kyoto, to Osaka, and back. As I write this, halfway through the trip, I feel very good about the amount of stuff I brought.\nBags  RYU Quick Pack 18L Topo Designs Trip Pack  Last time I went to Japan, I brought the DSPTCH Waist Bag as my day bag, and my shoulders immediately regretted it. I think my days or a one-shoulder bag with a computer are pretty much over. This time I returned to my tried and true setup. I’ve reviewed or written about both of these bags previously.\n Two Sea-to-summit dry bags  These are great for clothes and toiletries, and additionally ensure that even in a downpour I can keep a few things dry.\n One Topo Designs accessory bag  This time around, I loaded my toothbrush and some other non-leaky toiletries into this bag because I noticed the metal tip of my electric toothbrush kept almost poking through my dry bag.\nClothes Jackets  Mission Workshop Torre Windshell  My daily jacket. I’ve got two of these and they’re awesome. Not quite waterproof, but warm enough, and water-resistant enough for a drizzle and temperatures between 7-20C (mid-40s to mid-60s F).\n Arcteryx Cordetta  If it rains, I’m covered.\nShirts  Wool t-shirts from Ryu and Icebreaker  A great way to stay dry and warm or cool. These wash easily and are comfy for all-day-travel.\nPants  Two pairs of Outdoor Voices RecTrek pants  I wear these to work daily, and they’re pretty ideal. Comfy, flexible, and a bit water-resistant. The pockets are also huge which means my phone fits easily in a front pocket.\nShoes and socks  Blundstones Bombas no-show  These shoes go on and off pretty easily, and look nice enough for business meetings while still feeling good for longer walks. Half of this trip was a vacation, where I wandered around all day, including hiking. I almost went with my new KOIO shoes, but at the last minute, opted for slip-one with a lot of grip.\nUnderwear  Wool stuff from Icebreaker  Wool is the way to go. I’ve tried other solutions and they were nice enough, but ultimately, wool holds up the best and wicks super well.\nTech gear  Kindle Oasis Battery USB-C -\u0026gt; C, and Lightning: iPad and iPhone USB-A -\u0026gt; Watch USB-A -\u0026gt; Micro: Kindle iPad Pro 10.5 w/ Smart Keyboard  At some point, maybe I can travel with only USB-C cables, but that world doesn’t exist yet. Fortunately my external battery has a USB-C port and a USB-A port, so I use those two to charge my phone and watch at night. On the plane my USB-C to USB-C cable means I can top-up my iPad if I play too many games or get low mid-season of a tv show. It completely boggles the mind why the Kindle isn’t a USB-C device yet. Seriously. It’s 2019.\nOther stuff  Toiletries Hobonichi Weeks \u0026amp; Kaweco Al EF fountain pen お土産  The usual assortment of unguents, potions, and a toothbrush, along with my trusty new pen and notebook. I love this Kaweco pen, which is both completely blacked-out, and compact. I also brought some small gifts for 東京と大阪の同僚。\n","date":"November, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-06-devreltour-packing-list/","tags":["backpacks","travel"],"title":"DevRel Tour Packing List"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books To Be Taught, If Fortunate — Becky Chambers\nThis is one of the best sci-fi short novellas I’ve read in a while. It’s not quite hard SF, but I love all the little details. The characters are great, and just casually queer, and there’s just enough suspense to make it a real page-turner. A triumph.\nThe Guest Cat — Takashi Hiraide **\nDefinitely cried reading this one. I’m a sucker for Japanese cat literature for sure.\nRevenant Gun — Yoon Ha Lee\nThe final book in the Ninefox trilogy, and definitely the horniest one. If you military guys, there’s probably some fun for you in here. For me though, this was a great conclusion to a often confusing and wild series. I still don’t understand all of the math, but I love the world. There were some really interesting character choices here, and even though I wish we’d seen more of Cheris and Jedao chatting, the bits we did get were rad. This series was fantastic overall.\nPattern Recognition — William Gibson\nA reread of a favorite. I might or might not partially owe Cayce for a major style inspiration for my daily wardrobe. This story has a lot of artifacts of the early oughts, but most of it feels delightfully timeless.\nHollow Kingdom — Kira Jane Buxton\nStill not sure how i feel about this book. I think the idea of the book was better than the execution.\nMovies In the Shadow of the Moon\nA mid-flight watch on my way to Tokyo. Pretty interesting, engaging flick that gets weird.\nParasite\nThere isn’t a lot I can say about this without spoiling the whole endeavor, but suffice it to say this movie is incredible. There’s so much going on in every shot, and the actors performances are incredible. This is a rare movie that just keeps building and building throughout. Truly one of the best directors working.\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\nA rewatch of an utter classic of mockumentary. So many quotable lines and absurdly delightful scenes. The last word in vampire media.\nThe Art of Self Defense\nThe dialog delivery was definitely from the Yorgos Lanthimos school of deadpan, and the general vibe was extremely absurdist. I loved this film. Quite a bit of this movie was unexpected, and had me cracking up. A genuinely odd delight.\nThe Day Shall Come\nAn utterly bizarre and fantastic satire about the very real lengths the state goes to in order to prop up folks with no real chance of committing “terrorist acts”. It’s worrying watching this interview to get more behind the scenes of this film. Morris makes seriously strange stuff, and this is no exception.\nHigh Life\nSpace dads! I don’t know if this is a genre, but perhaps it should be since Interstellar, High Life, and Ad Astra all appear to answer: “what if dads, but in space”. However there was a lot of assault in this film\u0026hellip; it’s largely about felons being jettisoned into space, and artificial insemination experiments, it turns out. If you like very grim space movies, this might be for you.\nPromare\nA wild visual ride with a rather bizarre (it’s Trigger, naturally) story of fire people and the folks who fight them. There’s mecha, tons of goofy jokes, and even though it felt a little long, it was fun.\n","date":"October, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-10-31-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"october"},{"categories":"blog","contents":"(this is a very earnest post, and if you\u0026rsquo;re here for backpacks and travel, maybe skip this one)\nHey Brook,\nThis letter in a sci-fi tale would come to you out of the ether, dropping onto your iBook G3 on some particularly dark night of the soul. I\u0026rsquo;m you, but 16 years older, and hopefully a little wiser.\n(Spoiler alert)\nThe next few years will be a lot of fun, but also really, really tough. You will lose friends and family to cancer, then to divorce and\u0026hellip;\nYou transition. You finally do it, and it goes mostly ok! You don\u0026rsquo;t talk to family anymore, but you probably saw that coming, and it\u0026rsquo;s fine because you have friends who love and support you.\nYour finances will get worse for a while. Really bad. You\u0026rsquo;re going to spend a little while sleeping in your car and on folks\u0026rsquo; couches. It sucks. You\u0026rsquo;ll smoke too many cigarettes, and do some ridiculous stuff.\nIt works out.\nEventually, you get a job with folks who you really like, and they encourage you. You join a company that is doing amazing stuff with messaging (kind of like IRC, but way, way cooler—you\u0026rsquo;ll see). After a year, you get a little bit of stock, and finally pay off your student loan debt that you\u0026rsquo;ll have ground down for 13 years. It will feel great.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see a therapist, and a doctor, and a dentist with a regular cadence. It will help. I promise.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll love, you\u0026rsquo;ll lose, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get back on that horse. Ultimately, you\u0026rsquo;ll do a lot of reading and spend a lot of time with your best friend, a cat named Snorri. You and Snorri will travel from Austin, to Portland, to Oakland, with a ton of flights in between to Europe, Asia, Canada, and NYC.\nI know what it feels like a lot of nights right now. It sucks. It\u0026rsquo;s real, and you\u0026rsquo;ve had a hard time. Most people you know won\u0026rsquo;t get it, and you deserve better. When you get older you\u0026rsquo;ll know more people who\u0026rsquo;ve also gone through a lot of shit, and they\u0026rsquo;ll be good listeners, and you\u0026rsquo;ll listen a lot too.

Queer space necromancers! OMG. This book was utterly bizarre, and a hell of a lot of fun. I’m a fan of low-tech future space stories, where for the most part the book seems more like fantasy than sci-fi, so this book was a joy. Plus there was necromancy! Apparently there are going to be two more books in this series, which is a delightful thing to learn, because I want to stretch out and learn more about this strange universe.\nRaven Strategem — Yoon Ha Lee\nAll the world building and deciphering of the strange calendrical system paid off in full in this book. Getting a hint of what Jedao/Cheris might want at the end of Ninefox, this book deals with the aftermath of a dangerously peerless tactician let loose in the galaxy. I enjoyed all the strange details of the hexarchs, and imagining what each moth looked like. It’s been a minute since a sci-fi book got me so excited. This series can feel like a slog at first, but I think it’s worth it.\nNinefox Gambit — Yoon Ha Lee\nThis was one of the more challenging sci-fi books I\u0026rsquo;ve read in a while. Ultimately, figuring out what the hell was going on was well worth-it, but the first half or so was a frantic dog paddle to stay afloat. The world of NineFox Gambit is deeply strange, with technology that borders on magic that requires an empire to hold to a strict calendar for it to function. We follow a rad lady, with a homicidal general trapped in her head as she runs what seems like a suicide mission. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to read the rest of this series.\nMasterworks — Simon Jacobs\nLong form review\nMovies Eighth Grade\nThe idea of this movie made me very anxious. Middle school is rough, and I was on edge for most of the film wondering if something very bad would happen, or if Checkov\u0026rsquo;s AR-15 would reappear. Spoiler Alert No. There\u0026rsquo;re definitely some sad moments, and some very tender and sweet ones, but no one big terrible event occurs. This isn\u0026rsquo;t that kind of movie. Instead, Eighth Grade perfectly encapsulates how nervous and awkward we felt in our youth, and just how embarassed we were by our parents. I loved it.\nBetween Two Ferns\nI love the parallel world of these bizarre and failed actors. I haven’t seen very many episodes of the web show, but this was pretty fun.\nAniara\nTL;DR: Low-budget sci-fi cruise ship. This movie reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode, at least in its premise. I really enjoy movies where something goes horribly awry, and \u0026ldquo;what if we\u0026rsquo;re stuck in space forever\u0026rdquo; definitely meets that criteria, but unlike the Twilight Zone, there\u0026rsquo;s no big twist, just a slow sadness. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain charm to the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s Swedish as well. Plus, there’s space lesbians. We’re everywhere.\nMega Time Squad\nCompletely silly and fun. Low-budget time travel movies are often awesome (think Primer), but what if it was also a very low-brow comedy? Sweet as.\nBooksmart\nWow, I really should\u0026rsquo;ve watched this in the theater. This movie ruled. Outstanding cast, hilarious from start to finish. I want so many more amazing comedies that center rad women. More. Lesbian. Characters. In. Everything.\nSteven Universe: The Movie\nI\u0026rsquo;m not super fond of musicals, and this was most certainly a musical. Generally, I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed Steven Universe, but more so when it\u0026rsquo;s weird, and not saccharine. This movie leaned more towards the latter, so it was cute, but not really my bag. If singing and supportive friendships are your favorite part of the show, you\u0026rsquo;ll love the movie. TL;DR your ex\u0026rsquo;s polycule adopts you.\nGodzilla: King of Monsters\nRidiculous, but exactly what I expected. A bit of Godzilla, a bit of the Core. I\u0026rsquo;m fascinated by the idea that \u0026ldquo;eco-terrorists\u0026rdquo; have wide-reaching military power, lol. Shin Godzilla is still the best movie in the series, hands down, but this was a silly action romp.\nMI-5\nI fondly remember the British show Spooks, which ended in 2011. This movie was a nice reminder of the great things about that silly spy show.\n","date":"September, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-09-30-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"september"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" A return to form This year marked my 4th XOXO, and my 3rd at Revolution Hall. Last year was big, which meant it was even harder to wave at, or spend time with the other amazing attendees I knew. This year, it felt just right. I still waved at too many folks, and wished I had time to have a number of small dinners over the next year instead of so many “hey, I see you, sorry I’ve gotta run!” However, I got to spend time with a smallish group of friends, see all the talks I wanted, and even play some amazing new games. If you’ve never been to XOXO, and you make things on the internet, and enjoy building relationships, this is a great place for you.\nDay one As usually, the first day of the conference was a social one—with Glitch doing an Appy Hour, and Panic showing off the Playdate. It was super cool seeing all the strange community games and creations of Glitch users, along with a few presentations, and the Playdate is something I can’t wait to own. Topped-off with a dinner at Kachka, a lot of upcoming games, and one of the most hilarious videos I’ve seen in a while, wherein Brian Gilbert attempts to calculate his pet’s HP, Friday was a delight. The weather held, the toilets were uniquely chill, and the layout of the festival ensure I could wander and find neat things.\nDay two One of the first pieces of advice I’d give anyone going to a multi-day festival is “don’t drink too much on the first night”. I didn’t take my own advice. I wasn’t ill, but a combination of 3 glasses of wine and too little sleep meant 10am felt very early. Thankfully my hotel had Proud Mary coffee, and XOXO had Deadstock. A breakfast sandwich from Fried Egg I’m in Love completed my resurrection.\nDay two felt a little longer, as I sat through every talk, alternately crying and laughing. A definite emotional rollercoaster. Helen and Hrishikesh were excellent hosts, and seeing their banter develop over the weekend makes me hope they host again next year. I missed the Andy’s camaraderie at times, but I hope only being responsible for the whole festival was a nice change from also MCing.\nLunch was Basilisk. Unbeatable fried chicken I eat every time I visit Portland. Yes, even when I’m there for hours.\nFavorite talks from Saturday: Harry Brewis (very funny guy who I didn’t know anything about beforehand), Hundred Rabbits (delightful French Canadian vegan sailors), and Soleil Ho (what happens when you become the representation?!).\nAfter a quick dinner, I sat down for a night of unforgettable podcasts. I watched a man interview a chainsaw, and was utterly destroyed by Demi and Miel with special guests Neil and Mike doing Ray Parker Jr’s Ghostbuster song. The number of folks I heard singing “bustin’ makes me feel good” after this podcast taping tells me I wasn’t alone.\nDay 3 (Closing time) Coffee. Sandwich. Almost there. I was wiped at this point, but the talks were delightful. Mikki Kendall, Jenny Odell, and Rhea Butcher were my favorites from Sunday. A great mix of comedy and art. Food highlights were Navarre (another favorite), and dinner at Sardine Head. OMG Sardine Head. Oxidated white wine. Salt-cured anchovy. Dang.\nThe karaoke list was full by the time my friends and I got back from dinner, and a cab ride that included an episode of King of the Hill. It was fun watching various speakers and friends sing Pavement, Lizzo, and of course, the Ghostbuster’s theme. I ended my night with my friends Jenny and Joe, drinking on the balcony at my hotel. Our friend André’s room was right by the balcony, and he wandered out mid-way through. That moment of kismet was generally how the whole conference felt—friends wandering by, saying hi, and going on adventures.\nA great year XOXO at its best feels like what I imagine a community should feel like. It’s full of new people, old people, dear friends, and acquaintances. If XOXO was every day, I would lose my mind, but once a year, it feels incredible to be surrounded by so many people I care about, as we’re inspired together by talks, art, and each other. I’m so glad I got to go to Portland, for the first time as a non-resident, for XOXO. I can’t wait for another year of this magical festival, and hope many of the same folks will get to attend. My only regret is that I can’t somehow bring Snorri with me too. He’d hate it.\n","date":"September, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-09-10-xoxo-2019/","tags":["reviews"],"title":"xoxo 2019"},{"categories":"blog","contents":"I wish I knew more about art. Reading the titular story, I found myself reaching for my phone to understand each scene in the strange and delightful post-apocalyptic tale. As I held the painting in my mind, and explored the flooded wastes with Liam, Nell, and Co. I found myself enamored by the framing. How often are our relationships held together by a retelling of an old picture? Are we always trying to build a life out of the classics of our youth? There’s a survey of life, and an exploration of lost moments in these vignettes.\nThe opening tale of this collection plants us in Ohio, a place, we see, where even supportive friends or loved ones can’t save you from the yawning abyss. The suburban Olive Garden echoes in my mind with all the breadsticks I absorbed through my high school years. These youth were me, and the chasm felt real then too. From there, we follow a mother who lost a son, and a sliver of a life exploring a name—just enough of both to leave the reader wanting more. Then, a journey through art, mentioned above. It’s strange and beautiful, and a great opportunity to learn about the great works of fine art, if like this reviewer, you largely skipped-out on art class.\nFinally, we readers are washed up on the shore, like so many dead fish, with a man watching a lodge, and time-displaced, dealing with an all-too-familiar moldy bathroom. A word of warning: if you’ve lived in the the Pacific Northwest, the squelch of wet tile will be all too real. This novella is reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, or another fairy tale of exploring a new land. The phrase “crotchal belch” made me laugh out loud. There are so many great turns of phrase in Masterworks. The story propelled me forward, alternately laughing and cringing. I wanted the protagonist to seize his agency, and change in the ways he so clearly desired. I find these characters at turns fascinating and deeply frustrating. There were so many places where I yelled, “say something” in my head, but this isn’t a story of success, but learning and remembering.\nOn the whole, I loved this book. Masterworks, by Simon Jacobs, is a fantastic collection of imagination, and creative bombast. At times it leans into magical realism, in others outright fantasy. There a slightly disjointed nature to these stories, as they’re collected over years of writing, and lead me to hope Simon writes more—a novel perhaps—in the future.\n","date":"September, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-09-03-masterworks-review/","tags":["reviews"],"title":"masterworks review"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books The Light Brigade — Kameron Hurley\nDefinite Catch-22 vibes throughout this book, with a hearty helping of Starship Troopers. If you like time-travel and space military, this is a solid read.\nThe Psychology of Time Travel — Kate Mascarenhas\nAh, time-travel and lesbians: two of my favorite things. This book was an interesting take on time-travel, and inevitable meeting of your future and past selves. I really enjoyed the small strange moments between characters.\nFrom the Fatherland with Love — Ryu Murakami\nOne of the more bonkers books that Ryu Murakami has written, it combines both his fascination with violence with a scathing satire on bureaucracy. I couldn’t put this down and found myself alternatively horrified and laughing.\nThe Book of Joan — Lydia Yuknavitch\nThis was a very strange, disjointed tale of a post-apocalyptic redemption narrative. I can’t say that I know a lot about Joan of Arc, but I trust that Yuknavitch drew from her history to write this. I can’t decide quite how I feel about this, but I will say that I found the author’s obsession with genitals and gender rather much. Does the author dislike trans people? Was she attempting to suggest that they are leading us to a dark, genderless place? This was unclear. There was a blurb that claimed this author is at the forefront of writing about gender fluidity, and I would say instead, she is mired deep in the past.\nMagic for Liars — Sarah Gailey\nAh! I loved this book. What a brilliant marriage of noir and magic school. I devoured it in two sittings with a big grin on my face. Gailey is a delight, and after seeing them read the first chapter in person, I couldn’t wait to dive in. I hope they write more novels soon.\nRiver of Teeth — Sarah Gailey\nWhat an absurd romp. This would’ve worked better for me if I enjoyed cowboys or the romance of men, but still it was fun enough. I don’t think I’ll read the next few books in this series, but I’m certain my friend in book club will devour them. Well-written and imagined, just not for me.\nMovies Battle Angel Alita\nI read this comic when I was younger, and it’s kind of neat to see it made into a live action film. I still can’t get over the uncanny valley eyes that Rose Salazar’s character has though. Overall, this was ￼￼a fun action film.\nThe Predator\nI’ve seen folks watching this on a bunch of planes in the past year or so, and as a long-time fan of the Predator, I entered into it grudgingly. The first two films were tight thrillers, but at this point, I can’t tell what the series wants to be. If you can watch this for free, I guess it’s ok?\nBad Times at the El Royale\nThis was fun enough, with a pretty good ensemble cast. Nothing really stuck out as excellent, and in a few ways it felt like a less-ambitious Tarantino film.\nThe Quake\nA good reminder that disaster movies don’t need to have the glitz and glam of a big budget Hollywood film. This sequel to The Wave was rather slowly-paced, but exciting as it picked up steam.\nKilling of a Sacred Deer\nWow, this was an eerie film. At this point I’ve enough of Yorgos Lanthimos’ films that I enter into them thinking “what’s the strange twist?” This film delivered on that quite well. I love the strange, flat performance Lanthimos actors provide—they lure you into this world with everything just /a bit/ off. Also the young man in the film was /haunting/.\nFirst Reformed\nI went into this movie thinking \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s about religion and maybe climate change\u0026rdquo;. That covers it to a degree, but beyond that is so much truth and sadness. This was a grim, beautiful film that struck me right at the core—both as an ex-religious person, and someone who often mourns for the end of life for so many folks effected by climate change. The movie, at it\u0026rsquo;s core, asks if there\u0026rsquo;s any forgiveness for our destruction of the planet, for our destruction of humanity. I don\u0026rsquo;t have an answer to that question. This film however, was excellent.\nThe Lobster\nI can now say that I have indeed considered the Lobster. After seeing The Favourite earlier this year, I decided to go back to watch Yorgos Lanthimos‘ other films. I’m glad I did. This was fantastic.\nThe Ceremony (儀式)\nA bizarre 70s Japanese film about family, duty, and incest. Reading about this film, it seems like much of it was meant to be an indictment of the older generation, as well as the younger generation’s unwillingness to speak out against tradition. As a film, it’s truly strange, but also brutal in its methodical breakdown of the protagonist.\nHobbs \u0026amp; Shaw\nA very silly buddy comedy. They talk about balls a bit too often for a movie with two 50 year old protagonists, but it was fun at times. There’s very little connection between this and Fast \u0026amp; Furious, but if you like Stratham \u0026amp; The Rock, you’ll have fun.\n","date":"August, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-08-30-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"august"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" As my clothes gradually wear out, I’m slowly trying to replace everything with my current favorites.

There’re a lot of colors if you don’t want to wear all black all the time.\n2 tailored dress shirts (long sleeve)\nPants 3 pants — I just keep buying these.

I read this when I was a kid, but hadn’t reread it since then. It’s weird, long, and great. The rest of the series is supposed to be bizarre, so I can’t wait. The spice must flow.\nClaire DeWitt and the City of the Dead — Sara Gran\nAn alright mystery book, but more than a few times, I think the author attempted to add grit but just ended up sounding like a very awkward narrator. Also points off for a trans slur—like, c’mon, I don’t care who your narrator or, or how much of a fuck-up she is, leave us alone.\nParadise Rot — Jenny Hval\nA strange story of roommates, love, and interior mold. I hope Hval writes more strange books.\nMovies The Farewell\nI cried a lot during this film. Awkwafina did a fantastic job, and it\u0026rsquo;s cool to see a major US release mostly in Mandarin. If you\u0026rsquo;ve recently lost a grandparent, or have gone through family illness, this might just hit you really hard.\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\nThis was a very strange movie, even by Tarentino\u0026rsquo;s standards. A mix of fake show clips, stories of a man and his valet, and glimpses into the Manson family. I laughed quite a bit, and generally found this movie to be a blast.\nA Vigilante\nThis was hard to watch. It was very well done, and intensely paced, but the abuse in the films was painful. There’s a grim morality in this film, and a certain catharsis in seeing abusers punished, but fuck.\nThoroughbreads\nA fantastically creepy film about ennui and friendship. I loved it.\nSpiderman: Far from Home\nThis is exactly what I want from a superhero movie: fun. The stakes were much smaller than an Avengers movie, despite this film happening in the aftermath of both the “blip” and many deaths, and that’s a good thing. Instead of world-changing events, we got to enjoy Peter and his classmates goofing around in Europe, and the zany world of Mysterio. I loved this movie. The action was exciting, and the jokes were silly and fun.\nHospitalitié (歓待)\nA strange movie reminiscent of a short story I read years ago where. house guests slowly take over a family’s home. It’s dark, funny, and a poignant commentary on xenophobia.\nMidsommar\nWow. What a gorgeous, twisted, wild film. From the music to the ultra-bright summer of it all, I loved this movie.

I enjoyed the pacing more in this book, and despite the frustration with very 50s attitudes that still pervade the modern world, I enjoyed journeying with these two books to mars.\nThe Bone Clocks — David Mitchell\nA delightful collision of strange characters across time. This book is just fantastical enough to scratch my sci-fi itch, and literary enough to keep me satisfied. I hadn’t read Michell in a while, but diving back in was like slipping on a well-fitting shoe. My only complaint is that I got a bit sick of “psycho-“ being applied to every magic thing, as it felt a bit too much like RPG spell naming, lol.\nAn Elderly Lady Is Up to No Good — Helene Tursten\nDelightfully wicked tales of a murderous octogenarian. I laughed, and cringed in turn. A short, strange read.\nThe Calculating Stars — Mary Robinette Kowal\nThis is an interesting alternate history where a disaster changes the fate of the planet, and accelerates the space race. Unfortunately, no disaster can change the rampant misogyny and racism of the men in power in this world. The protagonist, Dr. York, is a calculator, and dreams of being an astronaut, after years of flying planes as a WASP. I’m excited to read the sequel, but so many of the scenes of men being jerks to everyone else were pretty frustrating.\nExhalation: Stories — Ted Chiang\nChiang is one of the only authors I’ve read that truly puts the “speculative” into speculative fiction. Combining a curiosity about math, physics, and philosophy, Exhalation’s stories show a very adept storyteller playing with quite a few ideas. Each story is so different, and yet similarly great. I really hope Chiang writes a novel at some point, because I want to roam around his world’s for much longer.\nSourdough — Robin Sloan\nA fun book on getting into a new hobby, and getting out of tech. I’m not a baker, but I really liked how Robin described the baking process. There weren’t many characters with real depth, but our protagonist was fun.\nThe Book of M — Peng Shepherd\nAn interesting take on a plague/zombie-style post-apocalypse. I had trouble putting this book down, and the story kept me reading most of the day. I got to hear Shepherd read from her book at a literary event in the bay, and I’m very glad I did—this book ruled.\nNoumenon: Infinity — Marina J. Lostetter\nThis series ruled. There were pretty significant characters who were trans, or differently abled, and I feel like they were written pretty dang well. The space exploration and discovery plotlines split and re-intertwined many times, and always kept me fascinated. Definitely one of the most interesting sci-fi series I’ve read in years.\nMovies Force Majeure\nA slow burn of a movie. Largely, this is about a family, and a father who is kind of a shit. Tormund from GoT shows up. Lots of skiing. Grey fog. Fin.\nRalph Breaks the Internet\nThis was super cute, with a nice mix of weird jokes and internet references. It’s wild how many amazing actors they got to join in the strange fun. If you liked the first film, you’ll enjoy the new one.\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix\nThis movie wasn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as critics have said, which isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a ringing endorsement. Out of thetwo treatments of the Dark Phoenix, I think this one was better. The story was a bit odd, but overall, it was fun and a lot of shit blew up. B- summer pap.\nStarfish\nA largely solo trek through grief, loneliness, and the end of the world. The soundtrack to Starfish was excellent, as was the performance of Ginny Gardner. Without spoiling anything, it’s best to say this movie goes in interesting directions and is shot beautifully.\nTV Good Omens\nThe best parts of this show were the weirdly delightful friendship scenes between Sheen and Tennant. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read this book, but the story moved along at a good clip, and remained strange and funny enough to delight me.\nBake-Off: Professionals\nI watched two seasons of this show this month—the second season is currently airing. It\u0026rsquo;s got the drama and silliness of GBBO, but with teams of two, and A \u0026amp; B groups that whittle down for a final set of showdowns. Liam does a great job hosting, and just like GBBO this show is a warm and fun thing to watch while unwinding.\n","date":"June, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-06-30-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"june"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" It’s probably clear by now that I love my iPad Pro. I travel with it, write on it, and practice Japanese on it. When Apple announced iPadOS, it suddenly seemed liked my dream of only using my iPad had come true.\nMajor updates New home screen With a glance at the home screen, it’s clear that this isn’t iOS 12. Onscreen widgets isn’t exactly revolutionary, but it saves me a slide-over every time I want to check the weather, or which meeting I’m headed to next. It’s pretty cool, and even though it’s in some ways a catch-up to what other platforms have had for a while, I dig it.\nCopy \u0026amp; paste \u0026amp; select Copy and pasting also get a refresh in iPadOS, with three-finger gestures copying, cutting, and pasting. I’m not sure how intuitive it is, but for power-users at least, it should work quite well. I’ve gotten somewhat used to the gestures already. Multiple taps allow for some cool selection specificity, though occasionally this feels more frustrating as I struggle to remember how many taps to select a word. I think this will get better with practice\nSwipe to type Ever since I started practicing kanji for an hour or two every day, I noticed I was getting repetitive strain on my thumb and hand. I’m not sure how much this new swipe-to-type will help, but I’m enjoying the faster typing it enables.\nDesktop Safari This single change is the reason iPadOS is a massive update for so many of us. Desktop versions of websites mean I can finally use Google Docs, or Notion, or Figma without pulling out my MacBook Pro at work. In testing, it seems like it really works, which rules. The first version of the OS just launched, so I’d expect we might see even better support between now and the launch of the OS in the fall.\nSign-in with Apple This sign-in upgrade will come to iPad and iPhone, and is an amazing privacy boost for everyone using an iOS device. By removing the need to give your email address to every service I use, Apple is potentially saving me hundreds of unsubscribes and delete from inbox actions, not to mention all the scraping and ad targeting. I’m very stoked.\nMinor changes Dark mode I love dark mode, don’t get me wrong, but this update is a small change compared to the rest of the amazing stuff packed into iPadOS.\nFiles updates Column view, quick actions, more metadata, and a downloads folder all mean better file management without a desktop. Apple also added the ability to use thumb drives and hard drives in the USB-C drive, which isn’t really something I need, but seems to be a big deal to a lot of folks.\nThe rest The list goes on and on\nWhat it means for me With iPad OS, I can’t think of a single thing I do on my Mac that I can’t do on my iPad with the exception of working with a very large Github repo (just try downloading and updating a 6gb repo over WiFi, yow). With the addition of Catalyst apps on Mac, I hope that even more developers will devote energy to making powerful and fun iPad apps in the future. This fall will likely bring device updates with minor spec bumps, and likely this time I’ll snag a Cellular version so I can take advantage of Google Fi’s data sim. Until now I’ve always been fine with tethering my iPad to my phone, but international travel makes that impossible due to Google’s restrictions, and since it’s essentially a free add-on, it seems like a no-brainer.\nAs of this year, I carry my iPad to most meetings, and almost always bring it instead of my Mac on trips—even for work. This new OS ensures that this will keep being the case. Macs will keep being a great option for my desk at work, but more and more, the iPad and the iPhone are where I prefer to do my computing.\nIf you haven’t checked out an iPad in a while, this fall will be a really good time to do so. You might not love it as much as I do, but it might surprise you.\n","date":"June, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-06-09-ios13/","tags":["reviews","iPad"],"title":"iPadOS"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" The search for the best, most optimized, beautiful, light, and pleasing things.\nWhy do we search? Scrolling through my RSS feeds, I’m reminded daily that so much stuff exists. I subscribe to newsletters for fashion, backpacks, apps, and general tech, and every single one has an endless march through the days of new things. This app has two columns for editing! This backpack is “able to transition from work to play and travel.” These are the best socks.\nI could go on.\nThe search for the best thing is best represented by the website The Wirecutter, with its incredibly thorough reviews of the best things in almost every category you can imagine. Started by a guy and his friends to get out of the grind of tech reporting, they began to painstakingly investigate categories of tech, gear, and housewares to recommend one thing you could buy. My friend’s homes are filled with these best things. Hell, mine is too. They’re right most of the time, save for when taste or niche need intervenes. But why do we care?\nSupposedly, experiences make us happier than stuff, but we still buy a good amount of stuff. Talking with friends, it seems like most of us like to think we’re getting a deal—by buying the best thing, we’re ensuring that our dollar goes furthest. The single thing we’re buying is categorically superior, and knowing that means we can stop looking, secure in the knowledge that we’ve made the right decision. And yet, I still browse these sites.\nThere’s a sense, at least for me, that something could be better. A new thing might suit my needs, or a specific complaint better. Yes, I have a raincoat, but do I have one I can wear near a campfire? Actually, yes, yes I do. In an effort to be minimal in my ownership of things, I’ve also bought quite a few of them. The irony is not lost on me.\nThe happiness factor Honestly, I own three backpacks, and three raincoats, because each of them is the best at some aspect of making me smile. There’s no way to quantify this that I’m aware of, but everyone has a thing, or things that are so neat or personal that every use or interaction with them is a small joy. And we all want to spark joy, right? As hokey as I’m sure many of you think Konmari’s Shinto-sequel philosophy of things is, it has certainly helped me in pinpointing why I own them. I pared back my clothing, and donated bags of tech detritus. And yet, I still look for new joys.\nWhether it’s a new iOS text editor, or a new pair of lightweight shoes, I browse through my RSS feeds with a delight in seeing fresh things. And fortunately, the delight of looking is relatively free. This daily routine of mine is akin to the window-shopping of old. I’m fascinated by the portrayal of the new things—the praises of their qualities. The search itself makes me happy.\nHobby hunting I’ve found it’s useful to check in every so often on why I do things. Do my habits make me happy? Do I find joy in studying 漢字 every day? Lifting weights? Lightweight packing? Is my search fo the best things also a way to hunt for new hobbies? The answer, for me, to all of those questions is a yes. And frankly I don’t think there’s anything particularly wrong with this search. I do wish that this curiosity could be de-coupled from capitalism, but the world we live in doesn’t seem to wish for the same thing. I think the best we can do is keep on searching if it makes us happy, and share the things we find and the things we own with each other—sharing the joy as well.\nWe might all search for our own reasons, but curiosity and interest is a one of the best things of all. When we find satisfaction, the key, I think, is recognizing it, and enjoying it. Until then, happy hunting.\n","date":"May, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-27-on-the-perfect-thing/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"on the perfect thing"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" This was a really great month for books largely because I got really into the Themis Files series. Price’s book on breaking up with your phone also encouraged me to pick up my Kindle more than I refreshed Twitter, and honestly, so far that’s been a positive experience.\nBooks Noumenon — Marina J. Lostetter\nAh! Another great multi-generational space exploration story. I don\u0026rsquo;t really get why so many sci-fi books are doing this sort of thing lately, but I\u0026rsquo;m into it. What happens when a ship heads into deep space to explore a distant star? This book. It rules.\nExit Strategy — Martha Wells\nA delightful end to this quadrilogy. I hope we get more Murderbot stories, but even if not, I\u0026rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed it.\nRogue Protocol — Martha Wells\nI’m really loving this series. Murderbot meets a new pal on this romp on a research station.\nHatching Twitter — Nick Bilton\nThis was a tour of betrayal, man-children, and absurd amounts of money. I’d love to see an Armando Ianucci adaptation of this book—especially the incredibly awkward visits with Zuckerberg. Well-written, and easy to read, this kept me very entertained on my flight.\nArtificial Condition — Martha wells\nIt’s really nice to dive back into the series, and the MurderBot continues to be a funny narrator a distant space-bound future. I still think it’s a little odd that these were all published as novellas instead of a full-length, but the episodic quality does give me an easy place to pause and get more to drink. I hope we see more of the new ComfortBot.\nOnly Human — Sylvain Neuvel\nA solid conclusion to an excellent series. It’s too bad there’s not any more to read, but on the upside, it never dipped into uninteresting territory. The tone of this book is a little post-apocalyptic, and I’m a sucker for that kinda thing.\nWaking Gods — Sylvain Neuvel\nThis is a series that seems to amp up the excitement with each installation. The first book set the stage, and this is the play. There is quite a bit of action, and a lot of fallout from the first book. A great sequel.\nSleeping Giants — Sylvain Neuvel\nTold through a series of interview transcripts, de-briefings, and diary entries, this rad giant robot story managed to suck me in fast. I burned through this book in a couple of days, and loved every minute. I grew up on Robotech, so some of this plot felt familiar, except without all the singing. If you like giant robots, and somewhat mysterious non-governmental entities, this is a series to check out.\nThe Traveling Cat Chronicles — Hiro Arikawa\nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster. I should’ve be surprised, since it’s about a cat—one of the few things that makes me feel all of the emotions, but wow. This book was very, very good from start to finish. I picked it up on a whim, and it’s perhaps my favorite of the year.\nHow to Break Up With Your Phone — Catherine Price\nA pretty solid book on establishing more thoughtful ways of dealing with our devices. The advice to think about why you’re reaching for your phone when you do is extremely good, and deceptively simple. I’ve found myself trying to just be in a place without immediately flipping though phone screens to kill time, and maybe it’s helping? I’m going to keep on following the advice of this book for a while, and see how it helps or doesn’t. There’s good advice on email and other types of organization in here as well.\nKilling Commentadore — Haruki Murakami\nThis novel feels like a return to form, and yet also building on themes and ideas Murakami laid down in earlier books. His obsessions with pits, cats, WW2 history, jazz, and simple lunches are all here. I\u0026rsquo;m a little tired of the downtrodden male narrator, but despite being first-person, generally our painter guide moved the story along, interspersed with interesting observations. If you enjoy Murakami, there\u0026rsquo;s much joy here. I hope this author is with us for quite some time to come.\nMovies Wandering Earth\nThis is the second-highest grossing film in Chinese cinematic history. I’ve heard about this book for a while, and conceptually it’s interesting to think about the Earth moving instead of colony ships leaving, but it’s frustrating that Chinese censors meant that the themes of the film are somewhat limited. The end result felt more like The Core than Star Wars, and overall it was rather disappointing.\nJohn Wick 3\nRidiculous from start to finish. The fights were fun, the plot moved forward at a fast clip, and this is one of my favorite silly action franchise.\nLego Movie: Part 2\nFun, but didn’t match up to the sheer weird joy of the first movie.\nDetective Pikachu\nHilarious and so, so fun. This was definitely a kids movie, but aimed solidly at kids who’re 28-35 now—my generation has the funds to relive our childhoods in cinema. I played a few Pokémon games, and watched the cartoon for a little while in middle school, and seeing all of the Pokémon I know flitting around the screen was a hoot. Ryan Reynolds did some fantastic Pikachu voice acting, matched by the incredible CGI of his fur. One of the sillier, funnier movies I’ve seen in a minute. “My clues!”\nBurning\nIt’s been years since I read the story that this movie was inspired by, so I barely remember it. The pacing of Burning was slow, but each shot was artful, and each scene a strange delight. Also, the ambling, slightly clueless protagonist seemed to fit right in to Murakami world.\nArctic\nThis was in a really intense movie about how fucking cold it can get in the Arctic, and how scary it is to be crashed there. I like to think that this is somehow an extension of the Hannibal universe, and that in order to escape capture he became a pilot.\nTV Ghost in the Shell SAC\nI finally finished this series! I stole my haircut (sorta) from the protagonist from Ghost in the Shell, but I’d never made it through the early 2000s anime series. It’s very episodic, and uneven, but there are so many highlights and breathtaking scenes. It’s definitely a classic.\nBarry\nIt’s funny that this show and Patriot exist at the same time, since both tackle duty, and the idea that someone who mostly kills people and carries out clandestine tasks has a fun side. Bill Hader hasn’t ever been a favorite of mine, but I seriously love this goofy show. Everyone, from Henry Winkler, to Stephen Root, to the guy who plays the extremely friendly mafioso is giving their all.\n","date":"May, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-05-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"may"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" The latest episode of Supercomputer inspired me to write about how I work with notes, todos, and reminders every day. Part of the episode was centered on their mutual dissatisfaction with various notes apps, which I totally understand. Over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve used NVAlt, 1Writer, Bear, Evernote, Notes, and more to keep track of my thoughts, posts, and notes. Brett Terpstra keeps a very good list of all iOS text editors that includes information about their cross-platform functionality. These days, since I mostly use my iPad and iPhone when I\u0026rsquo;m not at work, it\u0026rsquo;s vital that my notes and todo apps live happily on Mac, and iOS.\nNotes and posts Ever since I moved most of my personal computer work to an iPad Pro, I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to make sure my notes and writing were easily accessible from wherever I happened to compute. I also wanted to post that writing to my blog which hilariously I first talked about on my now abandoned Medium. Since I post things via Github pages, which is a near-as-makes-no-difference Jekyll instance, I need the ability to push markdown to Github. With Working Copy, this is super simple, and if I need to, I can write entire posts in the pretty nice editor that app contains. But, I want more!\nTo have a great writing experience, with delightful fonts, a pleasing design, and speedy sync, I use iAWriter. It\u0026rsquo;s fantastic for notes, long form writing, and even markdown previewing work docs. In the years since the first version of iAWriter launched, it\u0026rsquo;s become an amazing piece of software. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the earliest versions, but here\u0026rsquo;s the 2015 version 3. Nowadays, iAWriter can talk to the Files app on iOS natively, which means you can open files from Working Copy, which is registered as a Files location, so you can open files from Github repos in iAWriter. Whether I\u0026rsquo;m drafting a blog post, or updating my list of books that I\u0026rsquo;ve read, I open iAWriter first, after pulling the latest version of my repo in Working Copy. For writing and notes I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to store in my repo, iAWriter keeps them on iCloud as .md files so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about portability or missing files. Because these files live in iCloud, they\u0026rsquo;re searchable using Spotlight on both my iOS and Mac devices—no more depending on launching an app to search. It\u0026rsquo;s wild how good this app combination is, and how fast I\u0026rsquo;m able to find and edit things using iAWriter\u0026rsquo;s native Apple integrations.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m at meetings at work, I also tend to take notes with a pen and a notebook because it helps retention and looks quite a bit less rude to my coworkers or partners. If something needs to be shared, I type it up in Slack or put it in a Readme on a repo.\nBut what about my todos?!\nTodos I work at a company in San Francisco who\u0026rsquo;s goal is to \u0026ldquo;make work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive.\u0026rdquo; I think we\u0026rsquo;re good at it, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found that I need a separate place to keep track of my work tasks, my life tasks, and all the random junk I need quick access to when I\u0026rsquo;m going through my week. Things is that app for me. I made a Project for everything I work on, and Areas for things like \u0026ldquo;stuff to buy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stuff to watch\u0026rdquo;.\nMy main view is Today, where tasks I need to finish by bedtime live. When the workday ends, anything I haven\u0026rsquo;t accomplished gets moved to tomorrow—this is a conscious choice over having those tasks follow me home. That means that I don\u0026rsquo;t have the psychic dread of \u0026ldquo;more work\u0026rdquo;, but can still look at Things for things like the code to my therapist\u0026rsquo;s office, or a reminder to scoop the cat litter. I love it. Things is the perfect example of just heavy enough feature-wise to handle power-users while only exposing simple features for everyone else. The search is amazing, especially on Mac, where all you need to do is start typing. Sure, there\u0026rsquo;s no location-based reminders, but honestly at a certain point, in my opinion you\u0026rsquo;re just faffing around and avoiding work by adding so many layers to your todo process. Get shit done instead of doing loads of metalwork.\nKeeping track of all of the things For me, writing and notes goes in iAWriter, and anything I need to do goes into Things. Sometimes my tasks include a link to a relevant Slack conversation, or email in Spark, or website—and other times it\u0026rsquo;s just a note to take some medicine or drop mail off in the mailbox. My projects groupings mean I know historically what I\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished in various areas or work things, and I don\u0026rsquo;t stress too much planning months in the future. Planning, at least at work, is often a team effort, and there\u0026rsquo;s a calendar or a roadmap that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to duplicate in Things. I note what my responsibilities are, and set due dates or targets for those, and leave the rest to where my work actually lives—Slack. If you want to dive more into GTD or w/e, I recommend 43 Folders, which is possibly now disavowed by Merlin, but is still a very smart look at productivity. Generally, simple systems work well for me, and if I look at something, I should either store it, trash it, or use it.\nMy systems are super helpful for me, but might not work, or work differently for you. That\u0026rsquo;s totally ok! Hopefully something here was helpful or interesting, and if not, feel free to browse away, and forget~ Work will always be here for you, like a strange nightmare, and how you choose to tackle it is a personal decision.\n","date":"May, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-02-on-notes-and-todos/","tags":["process"],"title":"on notes and todos"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" https://screenanarchy.com/assets_c/2018/02/IFFR2018-review-Niswog-main-thumb-860xauto-70015.jpg\nBooks The United States of Japan — Peter Tieryas\nAn alternate history where Japan and Germany won WW2, then proceeded to divvy up North America. Most of the book is set in the 80s, in a world of internet devices, and giant robots, ruled by the Japanese emperor. It\u0026rsquo;s a brutal story at times, but was generally interesting and a good sci-fi time.\nIf Cats Disappeared from the World — Genki Kawarmura **\nI love a good devil’s bargain, and this book is full of them. This was a cute, sweet story about the real things we should value in life, and what we’re willing to sacrifice for life. The small details and strange obsessions reminded me a lot of Haruki Murakami’s style.\nMovies Avengers:Endgame\nThis was like three movies jammed into one. It was fine, but I hope they stop doing the massive super hero stuff for a while.\nHagazussa\nBizarre and utterly obsessed with liquids. Hard to watch, but also beautiful at times.\nStill Walking\nA delightful meditation on family. I watched an earlier Koreeda movie called Nobody Knows just after college, and it destroyed me. I mostly forgot about this director until Shoplifters last year, and damn, I loved that film too. I think i only have the emotional wherewithal to watch something he made every few months, but each time I dive into his world, there’s an incredible depth to how he shows the small ways we love and lose each other. Also it’s wild to see You-san in an acting role, and not on the Terrace House couch.\nLittle\nI don’t know where to start with this weird mess of a movie. It was super funny at times, but left a lot on the cutting floor, had an utterly bizarre trans “joke”, and the worst driving scenes I’ve seen. At the same time, it was goofy, cute, and a man behind us loudly said, “that’s her when she was little”.\nGlass\nWell, I’ve finished Shyamalan’s weird comic trilogy. I remember watching Unbreakable in the theater at the mall near my house as a kid. I’d don’t know if that mall even exists anymore, but for a while, you could go to the arcade downstairs, and then watch a movie in the theater near the food court. I was straight-up enamored with Shyamalan at the time. Sixth Sense was fresh on my mind, and Unbreakable was bizarre, but hinted at something wild. Subsequent movies took this M. Night from a must watch icon, to an amusing auteur, and I think that’s great. The Happening is a movie I deeply love, but this trilogy never really lived up to either the mystery or weirdness of his best work. I think in an effort to make a meta-comic movie, he made something that ultimately doesn’t deliver much past a so-so premise that heroes do exist. Which, is fine, but isn’t “he was dead the whole time,” or “the plants!”\nThe Night is Short, Walk on Girl\nThis movie is gorgeous, which is to be expected from one of Yusuke Nakamura’s works. The plot is pretty bonkers, and includes everything from strange gods, rare alcohols, and a collection of Classical Japanese porn. If you like this, you might also love Tatami Galaxy from the same folks. There’s a certain spiritual similarity to Tampopo in this film’s over-the-top appreciation for food and drinks too.\nTampopo\nThis was a really fun movie about how amazing food can be. Tons of literal and figurative porn scenes about noodles, eggs, and more. The western film style is kinda wacky and silly, but the overall tone was interesting. I was a bit out of it when I watched this film, so I missed some of it, but likely this\u0026rsquo;ll be a rewatch.\nUs\nSuper spooky. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the combination of very good dad jokes, incredibly talented actors, and tight pacing kept this film feeling scary and fun throughout. There’s twists and turns, and a very good boat name or two. See this movie. I’m stoked we get to see more of Peele’s work in the future.\nProspect\nWhat a cool movie. This tense space flick proved that you can do a lot of sci-fi stuff with less budget. I love media about shitty tech, and this is kind of “what happens when you’re a skint space prospector” angle down pat. This could’ve been a weird Cowboy Bebop live action, but instead tackled the idea from a different angle. Sophie Thatcher rules, too. Wherever this was shot, it was gorgeous.\nNotable TV Fleabag\nSeason 2 of this amazing show just built on the hilarity and sadness of the first. Waller-Bridges is brilliant, and it’s amazing we get both this show and Killing Eve. Fleabag is a meditation on family, loss, and love. It’s also one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.\nHomecoming\nThe end scenes of every episode give off a really Lynchian vibe. I never listened to this podcast, so I had no idea where the show was going. Julia Roberts is great, and Bobby Canavalle is a delightful villain. The filming was quite nice, with consistently interesting framing.\nHanna\nI loved this movie when it came out years ago, with Saiorse Ronan and a Chemical Brothers soundtrack, and this new adaptation was even better. The score was haunting, and the pacing and characters stayed interesting. I’m not sure if there’s anything left for a second season, but I’d love to see more rad, competent Hanna scenes.\n","date":"April, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-04-27-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"april"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" When I mention my love of Formula 1 racing, most of the time I hear, \u0026ldquo;is that like NASCAR?\u0026rdquo; This speaks to the sad lack of F1 information and excitement in the states, and it\u0026rsquo;s a bummer. NASCAR is a sport in its own right, but comparing it to F1 is a bit like comparing rotary phones to an iPhone. F1 is fast, the roads twist this way and that, and most importantly the drivers are from across the globe. Drama between these drivers, these princes of speed, is often even more entertaining than the drama on the track. With the launch of Netflix\u0026rsquo;s F1 documentary that covers the events of the 2018 season, my hope is more folks in the states will get excited about the best racing series in the world.\nMy history with racing When I was a kid, my uncle was involved in car racing as a pit crew member, and occasional pit chief. He\u0026rsquo;d gotten his start racing motorcycles in the 70s and early 80s, and by the time he\u0026rsquo;d moved away, I\u0026rsquo;d been to a number of CART and Grand Prix races around Dallas. My whole family loved cars. I grew up around Mustangs being worked-on, oil changes, and DIY repairs. I rode a small motorcycle as a kid I inherited from that same uncle who raced and wrenched on cars, and fell deeply in love with speed.\nWe watched a few racing series when I was younger, but my attention span meant nothing really stuck. Years later, that changed.\nWatching weekly After college, I settled into a tech career and had relatively low-key weekends full of TV and reading. The exact impetus escapes me (it was probably Top Gear related), but at one point, I found a way to stream F1 races every week. My new routine was watching the qualification rounds on Saturday, and then watching an F1 race the next day. I was quickly sucked into the dramatic rise of Sebastian Vettel, who seemed to be incapable of failure as he racked-up victories in the Red Bull F1 car. I loved watching Jenson Button, who seemed like a charming enough fellow, and Kimi Raikonnenn, who\u0026rsquo;s dry wit, and sour temperament was weirdly hilarious.\nThe modern era of F1 is largely ruled by three teams:\n- [Mercedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One): Hamilton \u0026amp; Bottas (Formerly Rosberg) - [Red Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing): Verstapen \u0026amp; Gasly (Formerly both Ricciardo \u0026amp; Vettel) - [Ferrari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari#Domination_in_the_early_2000s): Vettel \u0026amp; LeClerc (Formerly Schumacher \u0026amp; Raikonnen) These teams have huge budgets, some of the best drivers, and a cutthroat ability to rule the front positions of almost every race. It\u0026rsquo;s a little frustrating that for the most part, other teams don\u0026rsquo;t win unless there\u0026rsquo;s a big wreck or engine failure, but at least at times the competition between these three is heated.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve watched the Netflix documentary, you won\u0026rsquo;t have seen too much about these top teams, as Mercedes and Ferrari declined to participate. But, what you did see was the exciting race to be best-of-the-rest, and a very optimistic goal for Renault or HAAS to become the 3rd or 4th place team one day. Rules changes may eventually help even the field, but until then, even back markers can cause a ruckus.\nHope for the future With a launch of a women\u0026rsquo;s race series that has the stated goal of \u0026ldquo;[giving] remarkable female drivers an opportunity in motorsport that simply hasn’t been available to them before now\u0026rdquo;, I seriously hope one day we\u0026rsquo;ll have a female F1 driver. It\u0026rsquo;s fun enough to watch 20 guys race, but watching a few women shake things up would be incredible. I want young girls to dream of racing at 300km/h and have it be a real possibility. The first race of this rad new series is May 4th, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to watch.\nIn a different direction, there\u0026rsquo;s an all electric racing series called Formula E. Due to battery constraints, and I think to make for an exciting race, teams change cars mid-race, and there\u0026rsquo;s odd bonuses to speed that fans can vote on. I\u0026rsquo;ve watched a few of these races, and while I\u0026rsquo;m glad to see a more eco-friendly race start to gain steam, it definitely feels like the neglected little brother of F1 at this point. Perhaps in the future, this race will have its own cache.\nGetting started There are a lot of ways to watch F1 racing. Some of them are questionable legal, but Formula 1 has it\u0026rsquo;s own streaming plan, which is probably the easiest way to watch if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending a little money. Racing series might not be for you, but I hope if you do love it, you share it with folks. It\u0026rsquo;s a cool, weird sport.\n","date":"April, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-04-13-formula-1/","tags":null,"title":"formula 1"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Ten or so years ago, I realized I hated bringing heavy bags with me everywhere I traveled, so I slimmed down my packing to fit in one small backpack. My wardrobe generally cycles between a few pieces, so it wasn’t much of a stretch to adapt it to a month in Japan or Berlin. I usually write a post-trip gear update, but today is all about clothing.\nWhat’re you wearing? Whether it’s a one week or one month-long trip, I bring the same things each time Including what I’m wearing during the flight, here’s the breakdown: - 3 pairs of underwear - 2 shirts - 2 sports bras - 2 pairs of wool socks - 1 water-resistant hoodie - (weather-optional) 1 jacket - 1 pair of shoes - 1 pair of pants - 1 pair of shorts or leggings\nNone of the stuff I wear is particularly cheap, or particularly expensive, but on the whole, it’s held up well to lots of abuse, and many washes. The key to bringing very little clothing is a willingness to wash your clothes in the sink or shower while you bathe. If you find a washing machine, by all means, take advantage of it, but these clothes dry pretty quickly, and I prefer not to hope for something automated. If something gets destroyed (only happened once with some jeans), I can usually find a replacement, but taking stock before a trip of any of your clothing that’s in danger of ripping is a great plan.\nTops  Day or night, the tops I wear look pretty good, wick sweat ok, and tend to hold up to a day of hiking. I spent a while only wearing wool, but recently got stoked on a few other shirts. Sadly, Ryu doesn’t make the wool shirt I wear anymore, but there are a bunch of brands making wool shirts these days, so have a look around if that appeals to you.\nUsually, if it’s hot or I plan to layer, I wear a tank top. No sleeves means no pit stains, and with a hoodie you’re pretty set regardless of the modesty required in a temple or other spot. I’ve had good luck with Ryu and Lucy (though they’ve been bought by North Face, and I don’t know how good they are anymore). Arcteryx used to make a cool wool tank, but they make this now, and if it’s the same fabric, it’s great!\nA friend convinced me to try out these hemp shirts, and for the first time in years, I wear a few colors. They’re super light, super soft, and don’t get stinky after a few wears.\nI wear one of these shirts while I’m sleeping, and one during the day, and kinda rotate them around. If I’m gone for longer I might bring 2 shirts and a tank top, so I don’t have to wash as much.\nBottoms  Most of the time I wear Outdoor Voices RecTrek pants, which are comfy, stretchy, and cute. They run out of sizes all the time or I’d have a couple pairs. They dress up for the office ok, but also handle a lot of walking. Since I can’t find another black XL pair, I am currently trying out another brand. These Coalatree pants are also pretty great, though the tie at the bottom of each leg is kinda ridiculous. They’re unisex, which means the fit might be weird, but they’ve also got a ergonomic crotch gusset a la Chuck Norris action jeans. I don’t know why you’d do tons of high kicks in pants, but either of these pairs would handle them with gusto.\nYou probably already have your preferred brand of legging, but for me, I’m usually wearing either Ryu or Girlfriend. I’ve heard great things about Outdoor Voices leggings, but I’m waiting until I destroy a few more old pairs before I try them. For night time, leggings or Foxers are great for wandering around my Airbnb or hotel room.\nUnderwear  Breathable, light, comfortable, and durable is the name of the game for underwear. I’m always on the search for a pair that hits all four targets. Thus far, some have done ok, but most aren’t that durable. A better pair I tried were Knix, which were super comfy, but eventually blew up. Sometimes I bring MeUndies, but they too tend to fall apart too soon. These wool Patagonia briefs were alright. I feel like I’ll be on the hunt indefinitely, but maybe a few pairs of one of these will do if for you. All three are comfortable, and dry fast, but the Knix and Patagonia pairs are better for sweaty hikes as the MeUndies tend to get a little swamped.\nThree pairs of underwear might seem like too few, and feel free to adjust as necessary, but by and large: one to wear, one to wash, one that’s dry. This motto means you’re almost always set for two days, and worst case, you can dry a pair on the outside of your bag while hiking. The Knix and Patagonia briefs dry in only a few hours, so you could wash before breakfast, and come back, coffee in hand to some clean drawers.\nFor bras, I stick to sports bras from Pact or Calvin Klein. I hate underwrites, and sports bras last a lot longer between washes.\nJacket  Your mileage may vary heavily on style and need for this category, but my go-tos always include the Torre Wind Pro. I recently bought a second one of these, and even though I think Mission Workshop is getting rid of their women’s line (boo hiss), this is an incredible hoodie. It is DWR coated so light rain just falls off, and also fleece-lined so by itself I can handle temperatures down to 8c/46f. Colder or wetter, and I bring an overcoat. The two coats in my rotation right now are the Arcteryx Codetta and the Snow Peak FR Rain Trench (which is also fireproof?!). Good layering means even at freezing temperatures, I do well. If it was super cold, I’d probably include a wool sweater to wear under or over my hoodie, and I’d throw my leggings on under my pants.\nShoes and socks  Bombas or Darn Tough are the way to go for socks. Most of the time it’s not cold enough to wear longer socks, so I wear no-shows or ankle socks. Wool means these also wick well, and wash easily—depending on your food funk, a couple days is usually fine between washes.\nIf it’s cold or wet, I’m wearing Blundstones, or Stan Smiths. Summer means something light and knit like these Sambas. Lightweight, comfortable, and breathable means you only need one pair of shoes. If they’re black, even sneakers work in many slightly fancy situations. In my opinion, sandals should only show up in a public shower, or on the beach, so I never bring any.\nHat A wool beanie is great for warmth, so I wear this one from Tanner Goods. It’s expensive, but it holds up.\nPlan ahead All of my clothing works well for me, but I typically go to Europe or Japan. If you go somewhere much hotter or much colder, you’ll definitely need to adjust, especially if you go from a freezing spot to a hot one. If you end up bringing a lot of stuff for one leg of a trip, you can always mail stuff home too. Layering is your friend. There’re a lot of lists for women that have much more feminine clothing, but that’s not really my jam. For me, functional \u0026gt; cute any day of the week. But, regardless of your style choice, stretchy, lightweight clothing is the way to go.\n","date":"April, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-04-08-minimal-travel-clothing/","tags":["backpacks","travel"],"title":"minimal travel clothing"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books The City in the Middle of the Night — Charlie Jane Anders\nA fantastic book about humankind settling on a tidally-locked planet, but instead of seeing how we cope, we learn the stories of their descendants, hundreds of years after our first tentative steps. The light is too bright and hot, and the night too cold and dark. We live on the edge in an eternal dusk/morning light. The two protagonists, Mouth, and Sophie, are on the edges of society, yearning for things they\u0026rsquo;ve lost or can\u0026rsquo;t have, and all that leads towards. This book was a beautiful meditation on love and community, as well as memory. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read the Steerswoman series, you might find some familiarity, but generally the genre of lost technology and future worlds is incredibly fascinating to me.\nVengeful — VE Schwab\nAn interesting sequel to Vicious, the first of the Villains series. Most of the book serves as a prologue for the lighting-fast action at the end of the book, and I’m very excited to see what these characters do next, if she continues for a third installment. I really enjoyed the character June, because who doesn’t love a shapeshifting assassin?\nMovies Captain Marvel\nSuper fun! Brie Larson made for a very compelling super hero, and I love Goose with my whole heart. The 90s throwback setting was a delight, along with its soundtrack. I’m stoked to see what this sets up for future Marvel films, and hopeful that we see the Skrull again (please show up in Runaways).\nFlavors of Youth\nAn alright film about the things we leave behind as we grow older, and the tastes and regrets we have. Most of this film is set in China, which is an interesting place to hear all the characters speak Japanese. There are three vignettes, and none really tugged my heartstrings, but it was still a well done movie.\nNoteable TV F1: Drive to Survive\nI\u0026rsquo;ve followed F1 racing for years, and love the drama and speed. This series shows the myriad stories and personalities that make these ten teams and twenty drivers so cool. Even if you\u0026rsquo;ve never watched a single race, you might be drawn in by this series. I\u0026rsquo;d forgotten how wild the 2018 season is, and 2019 has only just begun. 19 more races this year to see if someone can finally edge out Ferrari or Mercedes\nPen15\nThis is an incredible show about middle school, embarrassment, and friendship. It covers so much ground and captures the 90s perfectly. The main actresses (in their 30s) seem to have a blast in every scene, and I bet filming with actual children was a trip. My favorite line was “I found that dress in a river”.\n","date":"March, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-03-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"march"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Since 2019, I updated my kit a little bit, but mostly it stayed the same.\nOne old bag, one new My Ryu Quickpack was a delight once-again, as I used it to transport all my gear to Japan, and then from city to city. Most days it sat in my room as I travelled around with my DSPTCH Waist Bag or just what I could fit in my pockets. Ergonimically, this bag is one of the most comfortable bags I\u0026rsquo;ve owned, but due to its size, I don\u0026rsquo;t like hauling it around all day. I hoped that the DSPTCH bag would work really well during day to day travel, and it probably would have if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t rained every day. The waist bag isn\u0026rsquo;t waterproof (boo), or particularly comfortable for long stretches (double boo), due to the one shoulder setup. I wear the Waist Bag to work almost every day, but for way less time, so I\u0026rsquo;d forgotten how little continual stress my left shoulder can take. Also, I learned that with my rain coat on, the bag slides up uncomfortably against my neck, so next time I\u0026rsquo;ll need a day backpack again. Most days, I chose not to bring a bag to avoid this discomfort. I hauled my LAMY Safari pen + a Hobonichi Weeks, my phone, and some tissue paper, so a bag was overkill mostly.\nTwo jackets I took my Arcteryx coat to Japan, and it served me well, despite being a little tight. However, I wandered into a Snow Peak store early in the trip, and my friend Sarah and the shopkeeper convinced me to try on a steeply discounted Japanese XL fire resistant jacket. It fit like a charm, and was long enough to easily cover my knees so I could stay warm and dry in the constant rain. I alternated between the two coats through the rest of the wet trip, but with both in my RYU bag, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much room for other stuff. I never plan on buying much in Japan, and certainly not clothes, so this was a pleasant surprise. As a back-up, I had a packable Baggu tote, but I never had to resort to carrying stuff in the tote on the way home. If I were traveling to a rainy area again, I\u0026rsquo;d only bring one coat, and which one would depend on how much layering I needed to do. It\u0026rsquo;s kinda nice to have options.\nJust enough space By the end of my trip the RYU bag was a tight zip. I bought two manga tankoban, and one Japanese novel, as well as a series of gachapon souvenirs, omamori, and a load of Vick\u0026rsquo;s lozenges because of my cold. Everything fit, along with my two jackets, but only just so. I wore my DSPTCH bag on the front, outside of the RYU to get on the plane or train, but I could stuff it in if I needed to.\nPlanned changes Next trip, if the weather is similar, my plan is to bring one jacket, and not buy another. Additionally, two pairs of pants was really beneficial, but a new pair I bought should pack better than the Nike pants I brought, so that will save some space. My new toothbrush worked swimmingly, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t bring a charger, since my trip was ~2 weeks. I brought just enough toiletries, and that felt nice. I wish I\u0026rsquo;d brought a tank top to sleep in, as I only had two shirts, so I felt like one was always a little funky from sleep, but because they wick, it was alright. For a daypack, I might look for an ultralight packable daypack, like one from Matador or YNOT, but my Topo Designs bag is probably good enough.\nNext trip Next time I fly, it’s a short trip to Portland for a conference I’m doing a talk at with some friends. Two days means I’ll bring my Oppose This bag, and have a chill, easy time. Hopefully I’ll get to go back to Japan later this year and test this whole load-out again.\n","date":"March, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-03-13-travel-kit-update/","tags":["travel","backpacks"],"title":"travel kit update"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books Genocidal Organ — Project Itoh\nA truly grim thriller about the cost of “fighting terrorism,” and the ability of language to tear apart a country. This feels eerily prescient. I can’t say I enjoyed reading this book, but it’s a nihilistic political commentary that at least adds some color to what politicians might be after when they start wars and conflicts. This book is graphic, violent, and in its way, poignant.\nAmberlough — Lara Elena Donnelly **\nIn some ways this reminded me of the show Babylon Berlin—it feels like an alternate reality 20s Germany, replete with spies, dancers, pasties, and patsies. I think it\u0026rsquo;s building up to a longer series, and so much of the plot slowly churned towards an ellipsis of an ending. I liked it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not rushing to read the next one. None of the characters necessarily captured my interest, but it was nice that the protagonists were largely gay. This book answers the question, what if folks wrote new stories with their own characters instead of fanfic.\nReclaiming Your Life from IBS — Melissa Hunt\nMy doctor recommended this, and it\u0026rsquo;s largely CBT 101 + some good notes on food and stress. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;ll be super useful, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see! I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if this is a problem I face, but the doctor said \u0026ldquo;probably\u0026rdquo;, so lol.\nMovies Anna and the Apocalypse\nA high-school musical with zombies. I really don’t like musicals, to be honest. I’d heard good things about this one though, and wanted to give it a chance. The cast is doing a pretty good job throughout, though the relatively one-dimensional characters of the “hot jock” and the “asshole headmaster” are schlocky. This movie mostly made me want to watch Sean of the Dead again, which used rock music to better effect.\nPolar\nMads Mikkelsen got his Takeshi Kitano take-no-prisoners action role. This movie was adapted from a comic, and it feels just like a comic, down to the choppy dialogue, fast-paced action, and dead-simple plot. It’s kinda fun, if you can get over the copious amounts of cartoonish murder.\nPiercing\nWeird. I read this book probably 10 years ago, and enjoyed it. The movie is a lighter adaptation, as it’s trickier to capture internal dialogue on film. Mia Wasikowska is outstanding as usual. I also enjoyed the general 70s aesthetic, and the cool selection of lingerie. This film only clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes, but manages to build and release tension a few times.\nSpy\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why I slept on this film. I guess I like Paul Fieg movies? This is delightful fare from Melissa Mcarthy, and a solid supporting cast.\nNotable TV True Detective Season 3\nThere were plenty of twists, and turns, and emotional volleys in this show. Mahershala Ali and Carmen Ejogo were electric, and despite it not being about anything magic (a girl can dream of ghosts and monsters), it was still gorgeous, sad, and true.\nRussian Doll\nA Groundhog Day about depression, drugs, sex, and probably psychodynamics. It’s good.\nTravellers\nI’m sad this got cancelled for season 4, but it’s probably still worth watching for the 3 seasons we got. Time Travelers take over the bodies of folks in present day to prevent an apocalyptic event. Fun sci-fi.\nSex Education\nGillian Anderson \u0026amp; youthful hilarity. Lots of new actors and actresses in this one that I hope we’ll see again soon.\nMagicians Season 4\nThis went from being a very good version of a solid book series, to so much more. Excellent acting. This show balances serious with silly incredibly well.\n","date":"February, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-02-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"february"},{"categories":null,"contents":" With the death of Google Reader in 2013 it seems like many folks gave up on RSS. Fortunately, not only is RSS still alive, but it\u0026rsquo;s thriving. Between Newsletters and a return to blogging by many writers, thinkers, and web folks, RSS is an excellent way to find news and joy. While Twitter and other networks flounder, open standards provide a simple way to read. RSS means no trolls and no reply gifs. It’s you, and the content.\nMy RSS history As a long time nerd and tech news reader, I’ve used RSS steadily since the early 2000s, when MacOS RSS programs like NetNewsWire and Vienna were fresh. I used RSS on Nokia phones, but the iPhone was revelatory. Version 2.0 of Reeder ensured a unified experience of RSS on my iPhone, my iPad, and my Mac—at the time I predominantly used a MacBook Air and an iPhone 4—which meant that by popping in the URLs of various sites, I could stay up to date at my desk or on the go. I continued to use Reeder until recently, when in preparation for Reeder 4.0 the app’s creator made it free, but stopped regular updates. Throughout this time, my RSS feed list changed, but usually had Daring Fireball, whatever Robin Sloan was working on, tech news, creative friends, and writing on productivity and bags. Some sites stayed around, and some died down, only to return. It’s always been relaxing to know that my news feed would appear every morning, and update throughout the day, which no social buttons or comments. This was the modern newspaper we were promised. It worked in many apps, tons of them were free, and you could save them until you were ready. Folks have worried about information overload since the beginning of RSS, and really, since the early 1900s, but I find RSS to be a simple way to store, view, and save stories.\nRSS today Almost 20 years into using RSS, I’ve settled into Feedbin for the backend (and yes, I pay for it), with its excellent web client on my work MacBook Pro. It’s lovingly developed, and has a strong stance on user privacy which I feel like folks rarely do these days. On my iPad and iPhone, I’ve enjoyed Fiery Feeds, which is independently developed, and even has a public feature roadmap. Both of these readers have good dark mode support, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to sync across platforms.\nI subscribe to newsletters with Kill the Newsletter, which lets me see emails as RSS feeds, and gives me less reason to feel beholden to my Inbox. It’s nice. Lots of folks have newsletters these days. It’s easy to subscribe and unsubscribe, and it’s even possible to make a decent living writing emails to hundreds of people. Knowing that on Sundays I’ll have a few new missives in my inbox or RSS feed makes me happy. These writers aren’t hoping for more clicks for a truck or razor brand; posts are either free, or supported through a simple monthly donation. Single authors don’t need hypergrowth, just some loyal readers with a few hundred at $5 a month leading to a decent annual salary. This could be naive, but it feels like most of these Newsletter writers do halfway out of a compulsion to share, and halfway out of the joy of writing.\nUsually when I’m interested in reading something, but don’t have time, I save it to Safari’s Reading List, which not only saves the site’s URL for later, but saves the page offline, so you can catch up on reading while under the water, or in the air commuting. In the past I liked Instapaper, but found that having a bespoke read-it-later app meant I was too likely to collect old articles that I rarely read. Using Safari means all my saved posts are just a shortcut away when I have Safari open. Sometimes I star something instead—mostly because Feedbin’s site doesn’t have a good Safari Reading List shortcut. Either way, once my feed is marked as read, at some point that day I’ll read the stories and articles I saved.\nIn the morning, while I’m getting ready, I usually listen to a podcast or music, and scan through my RSS feed. Even on a heavy news day, I have under 80 articles listed around 8am, and most of them get scrolled-by with nary a glance. This means I can parse what’s happening very quickly while I pour hot water on bean crumbs and head to the bus stop. Much like reading email, I try to only visit my RSS reader a few times a day, but unlike a social media site, there aren’t features designed to entice me to tap the “more” button like a rat in a cage. It’s pleasant. It’s slow. It has the people and things I choose in it.\nThe future of social reading I still use Twitter, but find myself typically talking about and sharing stories and interesting things in private Slack instances with people I care about or work with. This means I get to have a pleasant chat about a new book without seeing twenty posts about the world ending. I still see news, but with much less repetition and FUD. If a feed doesn’t spark joy, I let it go. SMTP and RSS may be old, but theirs’ is a lasting peace, and I hope if you haven’t delved into them recently, you revisit these tools. This year I am trying to slow down, take joy in rest, and find kindness for myself. I want a better world, and to fight for it, I need time away from the firehose. In RSS, I’ve found a serene pond.\n","date":"February, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-10-slower-reading/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"slower reading"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" My first Japanese class In 1996 I took my first Japanese class at Austin Community College. I was in middle school at the time, and decided to learn how to read Japanese so I could read literature and comics. The class was fun, and also super weird, since I was the only kid there. I took two semesters, but a lot of life happened at once, so I stopped taking Japanese, and didn’t being again until University, five years later. We used the Yookoso! textbook, and I crammed when I needed to. Outside of watching tv, barely had any practice outside of class. I wanted to visit Japan really bad, but for the time, paying rent was hard enough.\nPost-college life Eventually, I made it to Tokyo—Narita airport a few times, and finally to the city itself. I was both surprised how much I remembered, and depressed at how little I could read. It made sense though. I hadn’t studied in earnest in years, and I can’t say rote memorization was ever my strong suite. I started going to Japan a bit more regularly, and tried to practice, but focused on speaking over anything else. This eventually became more frustrating, because while I could type into Google translate, I never quite knew if the Kanji was correct. Izakayas—one of my favorite places to go—were especially challenging, because outside of saying 「すみません、ぼんじりがありますか?」(Excuse me, do you have chicken tail?) with different food names I knew, ordering was a bear.\nBuckling-down This year I’m going back to Japan again. At the prompting of my friend Jo, who spent a while living in Japan, I dug into Wanikani to formalize study of kanji. I realized that I would never get better at Japanese without memorizing kanji, which would also unlock a better vocabulary. Learning any language is a wild challenge, and with ~1800 kanji to go I feel deeply skeptical that I’ll ever be fluent. I’m glad trying, and as it stands currently I’m on a four-day streak. I also signed-up for a beta app called Kanji Garden, which has a slick interface. I pushed a bit hard the first few days of using that app, and have ~180 characters I’m reviewing. I remember a decent amount from my days of college classes, but hadn’t officially learned the kon’yomi and on’yomi readings, so it feels a bit like square one.\n頑張って！ Hopefully, this time next year as I prepare to go to Japan yet another time, I feel prepared to actually read quite a bit. It seems like if I really try to study every day, I’ll make some progress. I’m hopeful, and kind of excited for a future Brook that isn’t wandering around Koenji functionally illiterate.\n","date":"January, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-01-27-learning-kanji-again/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"learning kanji again"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" It’s a new year! Time to watch even more shows and movies, and with the rise of bingeable 10 hour TV movies, I have found myself watching fewer of the 90-120 minute variety. With Criteron launching a movie service, maybe that’ll change.\nBooks The Masked City — Genevieve Cogman\nAnother romp through alternate worlds with the rebellious librarian Irene, and her Sherlock stand-in pal Vale. The world of this book is largely a strange version of Venice, but more than the first book, other world’s tech is sprinkled throughout. I’m starting to doubt that we’ll get a high-tech book in this series, but I still hold out hope. The language is a little too powerful as a deus machina, but Cogman finds ways Irene can’t deploy it constantly, and still manages to provide a level of tension and excitement.\n9th Step Station — Malka Older \u0026amp; Co.\nThis read much like a series of Ghost in the Shell. From the NeoTokyo setting, to the ubiquitous cybernetic body mods, I expected Major Kusanagi to pop up at any juncture. That said, it also ruled. It’s been a long time since I read serialized fiction outside of comics, and the episodic nature made for a fun time. Each author added to the tale, instead of distracting with wild stylistic flourishes. I would happily read another series with Emma, Miyako, and the rest. There were less political machinations that I expected, based on other work from Older, but the story was fun, exciting, and well-told.\nMovies Close\nNoomi Rapace is a cool, collected bodyguard for a kinda shitty heiress who eventually grows to appreciate her help. Shout out to Indira Varma too, who was great in Luther, Game of Thrones, and now as a potentially treacherous stepmom.\nIO\nAnother great eco-pocalypse movie. Limited cast and locations, but a cool premise overall. This movie was short, but definitely hit many of my speculative fiction check marks. I want to ride an ATV now.\nVox Lux\nI loved the intense opening scenes of this film, and the scrolling credits—I’ve rarely seen something like this, and it felt brutal and fresh. Sadly the rest of the film felt like an idea that they forgot to film. Was she the devil? Didn’t explore that. Single mom? Didn’t explore that. There was so much buildup with no payoff. Terrorists? Nah. Long song b-roll? Yep. Even Sia couldn’t be bothered to record anything great for this film. Missed opportunity. This could‘be been Wicked and Divine, the movie.\nDestroyer\nAnother film with Tony Kebbell—seeing him in this after seeing him in Hurricane Heist was a wild ride. I think his American accent got better. Also, Kusama seemed pretty obsessed with Kidman’s face throughout this film. This was a intense sad cop/revenge film, with elements from many old sad cop guy films—transformed into something new by letting the old cop be a woman. I really appreciated the Halt \u0026amp; Catch Fire alumni, as well as the always delightful Tatiana Maslany. This movie felt like a different era, and painted LA in a grim, dusty light.\nShoplifters\nWhat a fantastic film. In some ways this reminded me of the anime Tokyo Godfathers—which is also about a group of underground folks taking in a child. The way Shoplifters weaved chosen family in with delightful vignettes and outstanding performances by two children was masterful. This felt like a Japan that rarely appears in cinema—a group of folks struggling with poverty, and not sure how to be part of a society that seems to expect them to join in. I will probably rewatch this, and highly recommend it.\nHurricane Heist\nI knew going in that this would be a bonkers film, having listened to the How Did This Get Made episode about it, but wow. Everyone in this film except for Maggie Grace is from England or Australia, and their accents are absurd. I feel like everyone got drunk, decided to use an “Alabama accent” and then a movie happened. Nothing that happened made sense, but also it was a hoot.\nAssasination Nation\nI’m still not sure what I saw. I think this aims to be a cautionary tale about mob rule, privacy, and misogyny. It’s brutal, graphic, and so full of -isms, I can’t say I recommend it. It’s wild that this movie played in theaters. I’m kinda stoked Hari Nef got to be a mean teen trans lady. By the end there’s a revenge bloodbath that I can’t tell if I was meant to find cathartic, or sad. This is definitely the most misanthropic and nihilistic movie I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in years.\nNotable TV Tidying Up\nThe masterfully Capricorn books on tidying-up are now a tv show. I watched all 8 episodes while cleaning my house, in one long fever-dream. Many of the couples are amazing, and at least one felt like they were on the verge of a divorce.\nTerror in Resonance\nAn anime from a few years ago. The story is a relatively common one these days, of youth attempting to “wake up the world” through a pointed terrorism. The music from Yoko Kanno is outstanding but sadly doesn’t appear on streaming services, but is probably somewhere on YouTube.\nInto the Dark\nA horror-of-the-month series. Each story is a movie-length fright set in the month it premieres, from a murder on Halloween, to a woman dealing with agoraphobia around Thanksgiving. It’s well-shot, and probably worth checking out if you enjoy horror-ish films.\n","date":"January, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2019-01-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"january"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This year I travelled quite a bit—almost 90 hours in the air. When I fly I always have my Kindle, but I usually find myself binge-watching a tv show, and keep my Plex loaded on my iPad with things to see. I watch shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime as well, but the local storage and caching isn’t always dependable for planes, and nothing is more disappointing than getting on a plane and finding out that your shows won’t play. These shows are a mix of joyful, and melancholy, and I loved each one.\nPatriot\nSad spies. This isn’t a very well-named show, as many folks have covered. Reviewing this show feels a little redundant because so many folks have talked about it in my sphere of tech news, but it’s amazing. If you like whimsy, and dark comedy, this is a splendid blend of both.\nTerrace House: Boys and Girls Next Door\nThis show is the one that started it all. I loved Boys and Girls in the City, and the bonkers Aloha State, and this year meant the end of the fan-subbing of the original show. There was a movie at the end of this series called Closing Doors that made me cry quite a bit as well. From the introduction of Seina, to the tireless Tecchan, and some of the weirdest folks ever on Terrace House, this season is spectacular. It’s a gentle show, that shows what randomly living with 5 strangers is like when the drama is low.\nCounterpart\nAnother spy show, this time set in Berlin. I don’t want to spoil much, but it’s a show about parallel universes, memory, and growth. I love the vibe of this show, and the way they play with modern and old technology. In some ways this reminds me of Fringe, but with a more serious tone. Well-worth a watch, if you can find it—it plays on Starz.\nVeep\nThis year I watched all of Veep, and in a time of political turmoil, when everything feels farcical, this show was perfect. Dreyfus leads a cast of masterful comedians, and the stories felt timely and fresh. I can’t wait for the next season. Everyone is so accidentally clever, idiotic, or hilarious.\nKilling Eve\nLesbian tension + spies \u0026amp; international assassin ladies. It’s perfect.\nBaskets\nAnother dark comedy that I initially dismissed. Zach Galafanikis plays two brothers and Louie Anderson plays a perfect suburban mom with so much heart. I never quite knew what to expect from this show, and it took me from uproarious laughter to tears in a single episode.\nBillions\nAnother show I initially thought was not my thing, but got sucked deep into. This show, similar to Veep, felt like a great way to satirize and use current events to tell a wild story of a determined state prosecutor and his battle against a hedge fund manager. I’ve loved Damian Lewis since his turn as a marine-to-terrorist in Homeland, and he is outstanding in this.\nDocumental\n10 comedians. One room. A ticking clock. The last one standing wins their own $1000 and everyone else’s too. The level of goofy, absurd, and scatological comedy is off the charts, and I learned of a ton of weird comedians through this. This is a Japanese show, and I hope that it continues to be translated by Amazon, because there are 4 more season in Japan than the two we have so far.\nAnime Girl’s Last Tour\nPost-apocalyptic queer anime girls. A friend told me the writer of this show wanted to illustrate how it felt to be queer in Japan. I’m not sure how true that is, but it’s a great show about friendship, and exploration.\nA Place Further Than the Universe\nBeautiful and sad. This is a show about a woman’s journey to the South Pole to visit the site of her mom’s death, and the friends she makes along the way. It’s gorgeous.\nKokkoku\nA show about family and time-stopping dimensional shifting. Out of the shows this season, this was one that I was excited to go back to each week. My friend Ren got me into watching anime again this year while in Portland, and it was lovely to get together with her every week with fried chicken wings and anime time.\n","date":"January, 2019","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-01-01-favorite-tv-shows-of-2018/","tags":["tv"],"title":"favorite TV shows of 2018"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This year started off with one of the goofiest movies I’d see all year: Murder on the Orient Express. I watched it with my friend Magda in Osaka right after the new year, in my “watch bad movies in Japan” tradition. Luckily, I also saw some amazing films:\nHunt for the Wilderpeople\nThis was the first great movie I saw in 2018—everyone was giving their all, and it was a delight. Family, rebellion, loss\u0026hellip; ugh, I want to rewatch this right now.\nBlack Panther\nCan you believe this came out in 2018? I got to see it in Oakland, and the crowd was dressed to the nines, and stoked AF about it. I saw Black Panther twice, and it’s the first super hero film in a while that made me smile and cheer throughout.\nAnnihilation\nI loved this movie, for all that it didn’t hew to the book, and was bizarre. I’d loved the trilogy when I read it, but also enjoy Alex Garland’s films generally. I can’t say why I love this movie, but I do, and I saw it more than once.\nSorry to Bother You\nI can’t say much about this indictment of capitalism and the gig-economy without spoiling it, but it’s excellent and you should go see it.\nWidows\nThis movie felt like a dunk on the lackluster Oceans 8, and had everything I could want. The stakes were high, and even if it wasn’t the best at sustaining mystery, every woman in this film was outstanding.\nThe Favourite\nOutstanding lesbian film. The humor in this movie was truly strange, and joyful. I feel like The Favourite came out of nowhere and blew me away, and except for a minor amount of rabbit-based fear, I was all the way here for it.\n","date":"December, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-31-favorite-movies-of-the-year/","tags":["movies"],"title":"favorite movies of 2018"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Started in Japan Last year, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo before the countdown began, and landed in the evening of the 1st of January. Making my way to my rental apartment in Koenji, the city was quiet as folks celebrated with their family. It was a strange trip. I got to do my hatsumode at Meiji Jingu with thousands of people, and see the Emperor’s second to last speech before his groundbreaking abdication next year. Parks were closed, but fortunately, izakayas were open. My friend Magda met up with me later that week, and I showed her Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. It was her first trip to Japan, and we both had a blast eating food and visiting a cool ryokan.\nPortland (interlude) I spent very little time in Portland this year, it felt like. I traveled slightly less than in 2017, but between bouncing back and forth to Oakland and San Francisco for work and various trips abroad, Snorri and my Portland friends saw me half of every month. I lifted as often as I could, and competed in two internal powerlifting meets. I kept running the board of directors for Basic Rights too. But increasingly, Portland felt like the wrong place for me. When I was in town, I often found myself spending lots of time alone, cooking and eating at home, or seeing movies solo. XOXO this year was fun, but the friends I spent most of it with were all from the bay. I’d made and lost many friends, and my energy was low. I started thinking more seriously about moving to Oakland during a really busy time at work, so it took a bit for things to settle. Once they did, my company was part of Slack, and I was suddenly moving to Emeryville. I’ll miss so many of my friends in Portland, but as living halfway there and the bay for a few years taught me, it’s a quick flight.\nBerlin My partner suggested offhandedly at one point that they were going to Europe for a conference, and that it would be cool to meet up in Berlin. I bit, and immediately booked tickets. We stayed in Neukölln, near Tempelhofer Fields, and I immediately fell for the city, the Berliner Weiss, and the vibe. More than a few folks I know have since or before moved to Berlin, and despite wild bureaucratic issues, it seems like a very interesting place to live. I ate tons of döner kebab, and loved visiting LiquidRom (a place I’d described as a brutalist day spa). Mads and I had never spent that long together, and it definitely brought us closer together. I flew home happy, and looking forward to visiting again, and had just about a week in Portland before I flew off again.\nCopenhagen This time, I was on my way via SFO to Copenhagen with my coworkers Brian and Mark to attend and run a booth at KubeCon. It was so, so busy. We ate a lot of smørrebrø, worked out in an old slaughterhouse, and generally had a blast. I spent an extra week there alone, with only a couple days a bit wasted by my conference-acquired cold. Vesterbro was really cool, though I still think it’s odd how many all-you-can-eat sushi places there were. I never rode a bike, which in retrospect is super odd, but I did drink a lot of aquavit, and ate a ton of wienerschnitzel. This turned out to be my last international trip of the year, despite my hope that I could get back to Japan in the fall.\nSo many flights to SFO Various circumstances meant I was flying back and forth to SFO more than once a month during the summer and early fall. There were early morning flights with afternoons returning to Portland for poorly-timed obligations. There were flights with friends, and lots of solo flights. Somehow I never quite managed to get status on a single airline. Near the end of my constant flying, I was happy to learn my new company wanted me to move to the bay by the end of October, and my friend Haley helpfully found me a lovely apartment near lots of friends at the edges of Emeryville and Berkeley. I signed the lease sight-unseen, on the assurance of my partner and the video they took that it was fantastic. It was, in fact, incredible. I finished up everything I could in Portland, had movers come, and took Snorri and myself to our new home.\nSettling into a new Eville life I wrote about moving to Emeryville a while ago, and since then it’s gotten even better. I feel like I’ve settled into a schedule here that includes powerlifting, seeing friends, and taking care of my growing plant collection. A very mild fall means I get to wear all my light jackets, and my short bus commute to work led to ample time reading. It’s been great only bringing an iPad Pro to and from work for the past few months, and I feel lucky I get to leave my work, and work computer at the office. The holidays were better than I feared, and I got to spend time with a few friends here in the bay, as well as enjoy candles, snacks, and books in my cozy home. It also rules to finally live in the same city as my partner, and figuring out a good cadence in our hangouts has been fun, if sometimes tricky. I hope to spend many more years here.\nLooking towards 2019 I’m hopeful 2019 will lead to more books, movies, and fun times with friends and loved ones. Work is amazing, and it feels great to be at a company I really believe in, helping create a product I love using every day. I’m also staying on the board at Basic Rights, and I continue to be proud of our work in immigration rights, trans rights, and racial justice. So much of making this country a better place for everyone means small local changes, and I’m glad to be a small part of that work. I might try to compete more at powerlifting, and I definitely want to go back to Japan and Scandinavia if possible. The economy, at the time I’m writing this, looks like it’s headed towards a shit place, but I hope to keep saving money throughout the year. If everything works out, I’ll even get Snorri a new friend, so he doesn’t have to wait for me to get home from work alone every day. 2019 is another year—a fresh year to live and learn in. I’m looking forward to it.\n","date":"December, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-22-year-in-review/","tags":["reviews"],"title":"2018 in Review"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Books Provenance — Ann Leckie\nA different planet and culture than the Raadchai from her trilogy, but a very compelling story. I got very confused for a while about who was who, but eventually I sorted it out.\nThe Dark Archive — Victoria Schwab **\nA fun, strange YA book about what happens after death, and the teens who defend the afterlife. There were some cool twists, and story details throughout, but the world building could have been better. Honestly every time I read one of these, I think, \u0026ldquo;wouldn’t this be better if it were gay?\u0026rdquo;, and reader, yes, yes it would. These sorts of books must really speak to teens though, because they portray adults as largely ineffectual idiots, who occasionally get in the way.\nMovies The Equalizer: 2\nThis is apparent the first sequel Denzel has ever made. I’ve loved the genre of Denzel as an ultraviolent avenging angel ever since I saw Man on Fire. Some folks may prefer John Wick, and granted, those movies have a great style, but damn, the Equalizer is a series I hope to see more of in the future.\nDeath of Stalin (rewatch)\nIt’s the season for rewatching films.\nSlice\nSuper goofy horror film with lots of great folks. I think B movies can only rarely be made great from the start, and this one could’ve used a little less effort.\nThe Fast \u0026amp; the Furious (rewatch)\nA few friends hadn’t watched this before, so we drank a bit, and had a rip-roaring good time seeing this again. Everyone is decked-out in the most late 90s gear, the camera work is bonkers, and the cars are cool, but painted like awful hot wheels. I love this series.h\nHereditary\nGranted, the central twist was spoiled for me, but so much of this movie felt joyless. Theoretically this movie should’ve been right up my alley, but honestly I would’ve rather rewatched the VVitch for the umpteenth time.\nWidows\nThis was one of my favorite movies of the year. Wow. A all badass lady heist movie with actual stakes! Everyone delivers in this film, and it was a hoot. A+\nCrazy Rich Asians\nThis was a schlocky romcom about a very rarefied set of Chinese Singaporeans. It was fun enough, and now both of the people I saw it with want to flood the aisle of a building during their wedding. Moms are a lot.\nGirl with a Dragon Tattoo (rewatch)\nMy partner hasn’t seen these, and I would watch them again basically whenever, so here we are.\nAnt Man and the Wasp (rewatch)\nJust as delightful the second go-round.

A true jam.\nEx:Re Ex:Re: A delightfully sad and smart album about lost love, and healing. This was a late-arrival this year, and has already been a constant repeat.\nAnna McClellan Yes and No: A similarly raw singing style to Dilly Dally, this is a bummer jam. The juxtaposition between her low, gritty voice, and when she moves into a higher register is fantastic.\nGia Margaret There’s Always a Glimmer: Continuing down the bummer album trail, Gia Margaret created a gorgeous album that combines piano, light percussion, and a hint of electronics to create an album that perfectly compliments how I feel when I’m lost in thought.\nThe Beths Future Hates Me: This album rips! Like, wow. What a fantastic, tightly instrumented, and infectious pop-punk album. This is a band to watch. It’s almost impossible not to sing along to this.\nThe Internet Hive Mind: This is a blessed year—right after getting a new Syd album, 2018 brings a new album from The Internet. Every track is a bop, and is a good way to come back up from some of the bummer tunes listed above.\nTirzah Devotion: This album feels stripped down to the core of Tirzah’s voice. There’s light instrumentation, and just hypnotic melodies and just enough percussion to get you going.\nSvalbard It’s Hard to Have Hope: This album encapsulates so much of the pain and anger of being a woman in the 2010s. Tracks cover abortion, feminism, and a lot more. Crank this up when you’re lifting weights, or just need to feel seen for a bit.\nRemember Sports Slow Buzz: More amazing pop punk from a band I’ve been repeatedly listening to from before they had to change their name to “Remember Sports”. Their lyrics crack me up sometimes, and I feel real joy listening to these tracks.\nCamp Cope How to Socialise and Make Friends: This is just solid indie rock. I love the lead woman’s voice, and the songs have a punk ethos and feeling, even as they’re a bit slower paced.\nSara Renberg Night Sands: “I googled elderly lesbians to cheer myself, but the results were all porn”. The grim humor and fantastic delivery of the vocals on this album made me repeat it often. Another great “yea that’s how I’m feeling exactly!” jam.\nHop Along Bark Your Head Off, Dog: This was definitely a year for listening to gritty female vocals. I have no clue how she sings this way on tour without just shredding her throat, but also it’s so, so fucking good. Every Hop Along album has ruled, and this might be my favorite.\nHalf Waif Lavender: I cried to this album on planes a lot this year. Half Waif rules, and if my other picks were kinda rough, her voice might be a salve. This is only her second album and there’s already so much depth.\nSoccer Mommy Clean: Another really, really pretty and sad album. The vibe of this album is so perfect for Fall.\nLet’s Eat Grandma I’m All Ears: This music makes me dance. I got to see them perform earlier this year, and even in Portland, people were getting down. It’s also super clear the women in this band are just stoked to be making these jams.\nTancred Nightstand: One of the gayer albums I loved this year. At times she reminds me of PJ Harvey, or Fiona Apple. The phrasing and style of her delivery is pitch-perfect.\nA note on listening this year This isn’t a comprehensive list of what I listened to by any means, and by switching to Apple Music partway through the year, my listening is fractured in a way that’s hard to glue together. Music at home often happens on my Sonos, and still gets sent to Last.fm, I think, but anything on mobile (most of my time) is mostly locally stored as history.\n","date":"December, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-20-my-favorite-albums-of-the-year/","tags":["music"],"title":"my favorite albums of the year"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Back to a single screen.\nIt’s been a year and change since I posted about my iPhone apps and homescreen\u0010. I tend to try out new apps pretty often, but now that I use an iPad and an Apple Watch every day, I generally stick with things that support all 3 of my screens well. Some apps have stuck around, but many have been replaced by better (for me) choices. Trying to settle into apps that I use for a long stretch is challenging as businesses fail, or apps stagnate, so here we are.\nOld apps Timepage—without support for the new style of WatchOS complications, I switched to Fantastical again. I don’t love it, but I want to use the same app in both places.\nCasts—replaced with Overcast.\nMaps—replaced with Google Maps.\nAirmail—replaced with Spark.\nTwitter—replaced with Tweetbot.\nSpotify—replaced with Apple Music.\nInstagram—I quit Instagram around the start of 2018 in a dual-effort to rid myself of FB-owned apps, and to stop using an increasingly user-antagonistic app that really bummed me out more than it made me happy.\nTodoist—replaced with Things.\nGoogle Photos—replaced with Apple Photos.\niCloud Drive—this became Files.\nTons of folders—this felt overwhelming, and eventually I decided against it, and went back to titles instead of emoji, and now whittled my apps down to a single folder.\nNew apps Fantastical—this is an ok calendaring app. I don\u0026rsquo;t love the visual style, or the colors, but compared to my other options this is what I have available. Timepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t have new watch complications. Google Calendar doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a watch app. iOS Calendar is ok, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t do NLP well, or handle meetings/etc well. This is definitely the app I am most interested in replacing.\nFiery Feeds—Reeder 4 is perpetually coming soon, so my allegiance to it is on pause until the 4th iteration brings support for my new iPad, and other nice things like full-text display. Fiery Feeds, despite an icon that I vaguely loathe, is a great app with a solid dark mode, and a bunch of cool options. It\u0026rsquo;s very customizable, and can adapt a bit to your style of RSS. I wish it had a Mac app, but AFAIK the only great RSS reader that works everywhere is Reeder\u0010.\nSpark—I don\u0026rsquo;t use email as often anymore now that I work at a company that doesn\u0026rsquo;t use email (we really don\u0026rsquo;t). But, when I do, Spark is great. Solid watch app. Solid Mac and iPad support, including keyboard shortcuts. I still hope for iOS dark mode support in the future, because on Mac the style is awesome. The calendar in this app is almost good enough to have me ditch my actual calendar, but unfortunately there\u0026rsquo;s no way for Spark to show its calendar on my watch.\nTweetbot—RIP third-party Twitter apps. I use this app in defiance of Twitter\u0026rsquo;s bad policy, and honestly the lack of likes and notifications is kind of a feature for me at this point. DMs are vaguely useless, but most of those conversations have moved to my favorite place to chat: Slack.\nGoogle Maps—I used Apple Maps pretty happily for a while, but eventually I wanted more recommendations and ratings, and I refuse to use Yelp for that. If Apple Maps connected to Foursquare, or supported commute scheduling, I\u0026rsquo;d be back in a heartbeat. Also somehow Google Maps understands that SF trans-bay busses pick up at a temporary terminal, and Apple things they don\u0026rsquo;t exist because the Salesforce garden of hubris is closed.\nThings—I love Things. Years ago when I worked for a certain fruit company, many of my coworkers used Things. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get it at the time, but also I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get having things _to do_\u0010.\u0010 Things helps me be an adult, and get things done. I run my life out of here, largely, and dump anything from chores to tv show recommendations in here. The new iOS dark mode support is spectacular. Similarly to Spark, the support of a calendar is almost good enough to not use a calendar app, but alas, the watch problem persists. Also the calendar is read-only, which could create an issue.\nApple Music—I moved over from Spotify, mostly to try it out, and to have access to my music on my watch. It\u0026rsquo;s fine? I don\u0026rsquo;t really know if I prefer this app to Spotify, but it does what I want, plays the music I want to play, and works well on my Sonos and in my car. Recommendations have gotten better, and while I wish it did a better job of knowing which bands I like have new albums, I usually find out. Concert notifications would also be cool, if I were making a feature request. Oh, and also dark mode. Please.\nThe best of the rest Slack—My love for the Slack app is strong. My friends live here. My chosen family lives here. My work lives here. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I would do without Slack. Before I worked for Slack, my company depended on Slack for everything from deploys, to bugs, to developer relations. Now that I work here, I\u0026rsquo;m so happy how much I can accomplish inside of Slack. There\u0026rsquo;s no way to fully express how much joy I feel doing my work in Slack. Seriously. This app redefines work.\nBear—I really like Bear. Many notes that have actions end up in Things, but Bear is my dumping ground for workout stats, meeting notes, travel lists, and other assorted ephemera. When I wrote about Bear in 2017, I did more of my long-form writing in it, but now that has mostly moved to iAWriter. Bear always felt a little weird for long-form writing, and iAWriter\u0026rsquo;s new duospaced font is chef\u0026rsquo;s kiss. I still wish I could choose a black theme with a custom highlight color, because I hate orange and gold, but çest la vie.\niAWriter—this app lives in a folder, but for my iPad and my Mac, it\u0026rsquo;s how I write. The ability to open files that life in Working Copy, that really live in a Github repo that runs this site is ideal The colors are what I would choose if I had full-control. It\u0026rsquo;s truly a masterful writing app.\nMoving to a “search first” model When I moved all of my apps to one screen, and began stuffing the majority in a single folder, I wanted to see if I would use search. On my iPad or my Mac, I almost always open apps with Spotlight, but on my iPhone, I usually would flick through screens or folders, aimlessly looking for something to tap, or even hunt for the app I use to book movie tickets. This felt like a waste of time, and further, became a nervous habit. Now that I mostly search for apps, I find myself doing less nervous flicking, and mostly put my phone down when I don\u0026rsquo;t have something to do with it. Out of sight, out of mind seems to be effective for me—maybe that says something about my object permanence? Lol.\nWrap-up I really want a new calendar app. I want someone to come into the calendar world and shake it up—or I want Spark or Things to have access to show their calendar on my watch. Or, I want Timepage to update their watch integration. Other than that, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy with my setup at this point, and find my phone helpful, pleasant, and additive. I\u0026rsquo;m curious to see how many of these apps I use again a year from now, but I have a feeling the list might not shift much. If you\u0026rsquo;re a phone fidgeter, I definitely recommend putting most of your apps in one folder, and maybe even reclaiming your time. If you have apps you love that you want to talk about, hit me up @brookshelley on Twitter, or leave a small gift at the base of the largest tree in your town. I will know.\n","date":"December, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-12-14-2018-iphone-homescreen-update/","tags":["iPhone","homescreen"],"title":"2018 iPhone Homescreen"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Queers and Steers As a Texan, and a lesbian, I knew eventually I’d end up in California. That’s what we do. We leave Texas, and go west. I’ve spent the past four years hundreds of miles north in Portland, OR working remotely for various companies. I loved the trees, and the few amazing friends I made there, but found it hard to get through the long, lonely winters. It didn’t help that most of my jobs were remote—Portland has a burgeoning tech scene, but in general jobs haven’t kept up with rising cost of living. Working remotely meant rent was easier to pay, but that most of my world existed elsewhere. This all changed when my last company, my favorite job ever, shut down and went to work for Slack. I joined in the fun. Working for Slack, for me, also meant moving to the bay.\nFast as you can From the time I knew I had a job at Slack, to moving was all of two weeks. I started as soon as I could to ensure I didn’t run out of cash, and with the help of a moving company, all my stuff was packed-up and shipped the Saturday before my second week of work. Sunday meant driving Snorri, my friend Amanda, and some clothes for 10 hours to my new home near an IKEA. It was a pretty drive, despite all the wild rain, and switchbacks. Snorri yelled intermittently.\nEventually, we arrived, quickly looted an IKEA for a few chairs, and set up my weird apartment. My stuff wouldn’t arrive for 2 weeks, so I was living that cool spy life until then.\nA month flew by This week is my 5th at Slack, and I’ve already learned so much. My coworkers are rad as hell, the office is unbelievable, and for the first time in years I get to work on a product I’ve used since its inception—one that I earnestly love to use. Slack is where my friends live, where I talk to my chosen family. Slack is how I interact, increasingly, with every app that I use. It’s still amazing to me that I get to work there, and influence how API features and partnerships are built out. Seriously. Wow.\nSnorri is still settling in, it feels like, especially due to his insistence that daylight savings doesn’t exist, and we must still eat breakfast at dawn. I think he misses his friend, Prince, but hopefully he’ll get a new one sooner than later. For a little while, I worried he’d get sick because he wasn’t eating much, but now he seems to love a variety of wet food, and even his fancy cat fountain. He’s still getting used to me working out of the house every day, and seems to relish my semi-shut-in status while the smoke from the horrific fires in California rage in the north and south of my new state.\nBay life I’m looking forward to exploring the city more, finding tons of plants to outfit my place, and enjoying regular sunlight soon. It’s great to know so many of my friends live here, and now I can see them more than the once a month I spent here before moving to the bay. In addition to just wandering, I hope to get a few museum memberships, and get involved in the arts and music scene in a way I didn’t feel able to in Portland. I’ll miss the evergreens, and my friends, but so far this feels like a very good move.\n","date":"November, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-21-moving-to-the-bay/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"moving to the bay"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Books Circe \u0026ndash; Madeline Miller\nThis book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read the Odyssey, this is a must read.\nRed Clocks \u0026ndash; Leni Zumas\nA bit too close to our dystopian reality for my liking, but this was well-written, and full of strong and interesting women. I read this as I was leaving Oregon, and so a lot of it was a little bittersweet. This reads as a more realistic (sadly) handmaid\u0026rsquo;s tale.\nMovies Skyscraper\nSo, so ridiculous and terrible\u0026hellip; but also kind of great? Like, what if Die Hard wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good, and had the Rock in Hong Kong? I watched this so I could listen to this week\u0026rsquo;s How Did This Get Made, and I am glad I did.\nThe Girl in the Spider\u0026rsquo;s Web\nWe\u0026rsquo;re on our third Lisbeth actress, and while Claire Foy more than filled the shoes of Rooney Mara, the same can\u0026rsquo;t quite be said for whoever replaced Daniel Craig. This was a fun, twisty movie, that was inadvertently stressful for my partner because of all the snow and ice driving. Lisbeth continues to deliver her brand of justice, while \u0026ldquo;then Lisbeth hacks the thing\u0026rdquo; is a major plot device. Kudos to all the lesbians in this, and the giant case of dildos. Fun movie.\nThe Guilty\nA wild single-room movie, that takes place completely over the phone. I love the narrative device, and the slow, dread-filled pacing. The movie largely takes place in your own imagination, helped along by excellent foley, and voice acting.\nThe First Purge\nYow, what a good mess. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I love the Purge films, and to be honest, this one felt a little too real. However, I watched this on Halloween, so it fit my needs of a spooky, scary movie.\nHalloween (2018)\nThis was goofy and fun, while still being a twisty thriller. Ultimately, these are morality tales about private property ownership, lol. A+ to Jamie Lee Curtis, and also all the random bit players. Definitely a good popcorn flick with friends.\n","date":"November, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2018-11-20-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"november"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Today my phone buzzed to tell me my new iPad had arrived at my office. I rushed down to the mailroom, and eagerly ripped open the packaging. For a few years I’ve used an iPad Pro 9.7” as my primary travel computer when I didn’t need to work on Kubernetes/DevOps stuff, and I’ve loved it. Whether I was watching shows on Netflix or Plex that I’d downloaded before a flight, editing my website in Working Copy, or just editing photos and browsing Twitter, this was the machine I wanted to use.\nNow, I have 1.3” more screen, a more lap-capable keyboard, and 120hz refresh, and I couldn’t be happier.\nThe screen This iPad might not feel like as huge of a revelation to someone who used the 10.5”, but coming from the 9.7”, this screen feels luxurious. The smooth 120hz refresh rate means opening apps, and moving around looks amazing. The color and viewing angles are still the best in the tablet world, and make my even my MacBook feel like a relic of the past. It’s responsive, bright, and a joy to watch tv on.\nThe case My iPad is the Space Grey color, and it looks excellent. The industrial lines of the sides are reminiscent of my favorite iPhone, the 4. Overall the iPad feels thin, and around the weight of my 9.7” even with the added screen size, and when I have it out of the keyboard folio, I don’t want to put it down. This tablet feels great in my hands. I seriously hope that Apple brings this design language to the next generation of iPhones, even though I wonder if they can while still keeping the glass back for wireless charging.\nThe keyboard folio My main use of the iPad is with a keyboard attached, as I use it as a laptop mostly, which sometimes becomes a handheld tablet for reading. I’m still not convinced there needed to be two viewing angles, but the stiffness and lack of weird folding means it feels pretty great in my lap or on a desk. The tablet-mode keyboard against your fingers thing is slightly odd, but it also reminds me of playing the accordion, which I find funny enough to enjoy it. The keys feel nice and responsive, and largely the same as the 9.7” keyboard. If they changed the keys, I can’t tell. I do enjoy the slightly larger size that matches the bigger device, and my mistypes are few and far-between. Clicking the iPad into the folio feels fast and easy, even if it requires slightly more lining up than previously. With the folio closed, the iPad feel grippy, and like a thin notebook in the best way. The weight and feel, in my opinion, remind you that you’re holding a high quality device. The folio adds a little thickness, but I think it only brings the device to the previous size, so I haven’t felt like it was too thick.\nUSB-C It’s great. I love using the same charger for this iPad and my MacBook. I already invested in USB-C to lighting cables, so bringing this iPad and no USB spare battery for my iPhone sounds great. I haven’t tried plugging anything weird into the port, but folks at the Verge did their damndest to stump the port. Spoiler it doesn’t work with printers.\nBattery life It’s about the same as my old iPad, which is excellent.\nSpeakers There’s four of them. They’re loud, and clear. A+\nFaceID Just as quick and easy as my previous iPhone X, and possibly a little slower than the XS. I can’t quite tell, but I feel a little like I’m waiting now compared to using my phone. I haven’t timed it though, but generally it’s much better and easier than the TouchID.\nWrap-up This is the iPad to get—whether you get the 12.9” or the 11”, especially if you haven’t upgraded in a few years. I seriously feel like this is the future of Apple computing, and iOS 13 is sure to bring more advanced features that mean I might not need a Mac outside of my office.\n","date":"November, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-11-07-new-ipad-review/","tags":["iPad","review"],"title":"2018 iPad Pro Review"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books Sympathy — Olivia Sudjic *\nWow, I loved this book. A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It\u0026rsquo;s also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.\nInvasions — Calvin Gimpelevich\nMy review. TL;DR it was great. Buy it.\nLove \u0026amp; Estrogen \u0026ndash; Samantha Allen\nI don\u0026rsquo;t usually read trans memoir\u0026ndash;and I have a forthcoming piece that challenges and lampoons it to a degree\u0026ndash;but Samantha is a friend and her story is close to my heart because of that. I had the chance to chat with her a lot through the course of part of this love and transition story, and I enjoyed the way she told it. This memoir definitely touched on some of the tropes of the genre, but by also being a wonderful love story, it manages to eschew many more.\nThe Tea Master \u0026amp; the Detective \u0026ndash; Aliette de Bodard **\nThis was a fun detective tale with a mysterious Sherlock and a spaceship Watson. The setup never quite paid off with its mystery, but I look forward to reading more hooks in the series. I also worried a bit that it would fetishize or exoticize Chinese culture, but outside of the space-protection tea, it largely doesn\u0026rsquo;t come up.\nMovies Halloween\nA spooky throwback to get ready for the sequel. I guess they made a bunch of these and they were all garbage, and the new movie aims to erase them. I think somehow the only one I\u0026rsquo;d seen was Season of the Witch, which is the 3rd movie in the original set. The 70s were a weird time, and the amount of nudity random \u0026ldquo;gotta take my clothes off\u0026rdquo; is just yikes. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the pacing of the new film is more up to modern standards though, because dang, did this feel dated and slow in a lot of ways.\nHotel Artemis\nFrom the preview, I assumed this would be a John Wick knockoff, but it was fun in its own right. Lots of action, Jenny Slate, and a wide array of solid actors. The future is a dismal one, but hey, that checks out.\nBeirut\nWhat if John Hamm\u0026rsquo;s Mad Men character was a state department guy turned negotiator? 70s Beirut is a trip in the way it\u0026rsquo;s presented, and knowing a little history, this seems like a wild but semi-accurate portrayal of all the folks who fought over Lebanon during and after the civil war. This is a tonally dark political thriller, and I dug it.\nVenom\nWhat a perfectly odd anti-hero film. I was a big Venom fan as a kid, and this movie delivered everything I wanted in a Venom movie. Fuck the haters, this is a hoot. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this should win any prizes for cinema but it\u0026rsquo;s fun, and provided lots of awkward laughs. The action was exciting, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for a sequel full of carnage.\nSicario: Day of the Solado\nAnother ridiculous action film about \u0026ldquo;the cartels\u0026rdquo; that I can\u0026rsquo;t honestly tell is meant to make folks dislike the US or root for us. If you want to watch Cable/Thanos run around and shoot things, this is probalby a good movie for you. I don\u0026rsquo;t find these very clever, but mostly I wish we got an Equalizer-style movie focused on Benecio Del Toro\u0026rsquo;s character. While I\u0026rsquo;m hoping, perhaps Demián Bichir can be in the third movie.\nMandy\nA weirdo pyschadelic mess of a movie. I hate that a woman\u0026rsquo;s death is used as a catalyst, but beyond that this is a bloody, ridiculous revenge flick. The music is great throughout and perhaps we were all delirious, but my theater laughed quite a bit.\nDawn of the Dead (2004/Rewatch)\nI could watch this every year. This is an excellent remake of an excellent zombie film. Everyone gives their all, and so many of the deaths, kills, and twists are perfect. A+ work from before Zach Snyder made cruddy films.\n","date":"October, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2018-10-30-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"october"},{"categories":null,"contents":"It begins with a rip, the tearing sound of velcro—mix and match nipples kick off this delightfully strange collection of speculative fiction, trans body-horror, and water-logged zombies. Calvin impressed me last year with his part in Meanwhile, Elsewhere, revisited here as the excellent Rent, Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell. This story explores a world in which bodies are traded for a time for fitness or fetish and how trans people deal with this faustian bargain. Another tale invites us to an isolated cabin for a wedding party that begins to fray at the edges in a blizzard. And, while every story isn\u0026rsquo;t is a life-or-death one, but the weight of mortality permeates each page.\nWhether the reader is wandering a bathhouse, stumbling through the streets, newly minted as a middle-aged-man, we are reminded each time that the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit us. Invasions captures the feeling of being trans, even in innocuous settings. It\u0026rsquo;s never Cronenberg, but regardless of how wild the twist, it\u0026rsquo;s grounded and bodied in a way he couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine. Occasionally, a story follows an ostensibly cisgender person, to probe the space around a trans life, and to me these are the most speculative: \u0026ldquo;What do they see in us? What do they think?\u0026rdquo; To answer this question, one protagonist even employs a psychic talent to sift through memory and desire in those around him, even through their final moments.\nThis collection also challenges ideas around surgery, queer bodies, and perception. In Eternal Boy, we meet a queer person figuring out their gender, but at odds with their presentation as a boy; they\u0026rsquo;re uncertain about the way women see them, but also willing to overlook those feelings for a chance to hook up. These characters are complicated; they\u0026rsquo;re often anti-heroes, or even villains. We need more trans villains in a world of trans characters that are almost always a sob story or a heartwarming tale. I\u0026rsquo;m here for the dirty, confused, angry, and alien.\nOne of closing stories is about a surgery center full of the wild variety of trans folks I\u0026rsquo;ve met: from older late-transitioning women, to confident girls with their moms. Not content to let cis people be the only foil for trans protagonists, Calvin writes the interplay between intergenerational and intergender conflict and love wonderfully. On the heels of You Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Have Known is the more general body horror of pregnancy and a failure of the healthcare system.\nInvasions is one of the best collections I\u0026rsquo;ve read in quite some time, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see Calvin\u0026rsquo;s next book or collection. Pick up a copy today. This writer is one to watch, and tell your friends about—a real trans-writers-writer. He delivered on the promise of his story in Meanwhile, Elsewhere with gusto, and blew this reader away.\n","date":"October, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-14-invasions-review/","tags":["reviews"],"title":"A Review of Invasions by Calvin Gimpelevich"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Recently, I ordered a medium Sling Pack after deciding I wanted a very small bag to bring with me to meetings or coffee shops where I only needed my iPad and a few other sundries. 11pm is not a great time to make decisions, so I clicked the order button before I checked measurements, and was sad when I realized it didn\u0026rsquo;t actually fit my 9.7\u0026rdquo; iPad. Luckily, I was already flying to San Francisco a week later, and was able to exchange it for the Waist Bag, after trying it on in the store. (An aside: the guy at DSPTCH was super nice, and really helpful, which further won me over. I think they have lots of great stuff, so even if this bag is too small for you, check it out.)\nTL;DR this bag is fantastic for exactly what I bought it for—carrying an iPad and a few other things to meetings, or very short trips. A+ would buy again.\nPockets and zips I love the way the pockets and zipper are laid out in this bag. The top of the bag is accessible via a single, incredibly tactile zipper pull. Seriously, this zipper pull is rad. Once unzipped, the main compartment is broken into two parts: one slightly padded iPad sleeve, and a slightly larger main area with a D-ring for keys. My 12\u0026rdquo; MacBook fits in the main area, which WOW. Not much else fits in the main area if I put my laptop in here, but still, this is unbelievably cool. With an iPad, a Kindle Oasis, a rolled-up shirt, a pair of underwear, keys, and toiletries this compartment is pretty tightly packed, but the zipper is sufficiently robust (it\u0026rsquo;s a big YKK), so I don\u0026rsquo;t feel worried about it failing.\nThe front of the bag is a flap with two super cool magnetic Fidlock® snaps. Pulling down slightly on each side reveals two slightly baggy pockets with elastic at the top. These pockets both have a vertical separation between the front and back of the pocket. I can fit a USB-C battery pack and cables, plus some headphones on one side, and a Hobonichi Techo, a Lamy Safari, and keycards, lip balm, and essential oil in the other. I\u0026rsquo;ve also fit a Kindle Oasis in one of the pockets, but it was a tight fit, and I prefer keeping it in the main bag pocket. The ease of popping open the snaps after pulling the bag around to the front reminds me why I loved messenger bags back in the day. It\u0026rsquo;s super cool. I love having all of my stuff easily-accessible, but I\u0026rsquo;m also glad my load ends up light enough not to hurt my shoulder. More on that later.\nMaterial The DSPTCH site says this bag is 1680D Ballistic Nylon with DWR coating, lined with 410D Nylon Packcloth with DWR coating. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested this bag in the rain yet, but the zip isn\u0026rsquo;t seam-sealed, so while I\u0026rsquo;d trust it in a light rain, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t swim with it. I bring a dry bag with me everywhere for toiletries though, and it\u0026rsquo;s sufficiently large I could put the bag in it in a pinch, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too worried. The material feels very nice, and high-quality, and the stitching and construction inspires confidence. The zipper pull is lightly textured on both sides, as well as contoured for a thumb and forefinger such that every use of it makes me smile.\nThis is a bag you will want to open and close. The Fidlock® snaps are similarly fun to use. The strap is pretty solid as well, and my only complaint is that I wish the clasp was metal/magnetic instead of plastic, even though the plastic feels solid. This bag generally feels like it will hold up for over 10 years, and Dpstch warranties it, which gives me even more confidence as I lug it around. I\u0026rsquo;d be amiss if I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention the \u0026ldquo;high air flow back mesh for longer periods of wear,\u0026rdquo; which means I don\u0026rsquo;t end up with as much sweat on my back when I\u0026rsquo;m walking around in over environments \u0026gt;20˚.\nSize This is a small bag. You can wear it over the shoulder, as a cross body, either in front or on your back, or as a fanny-pack/waist bag as the name indicates. In inches, it measures at 8L, or 13\u0026rdquo; x 9\u0026rdquo; x 1.5\u0026rdquo; at 1.1lbs, but the numbers belie how much it can carry. This is the kind of bag your friends say \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; to as you slide out a 9.7\u0026rdquo; iPad or 12\u0026rdquo; MacBook. This bag fits really well on the floor under a seat on a plane without compromising foot space. It also feels great to walk in a crowd or get onto a crowded train knowing I won\u0026rsquo;t bonk anyone with this bag, as it barely sticks out from my back. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to adjust the strap that goes around my chest as well, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to slide this bag around to the front when I need to pull something out. I\u0026rsquo;ve occasionally worn this bag on my hip/butt as a fanny-pack, and while I think it looks a little silly, it\u0026rsquo;s very comfortable—your mileage may vary on style/feel.\nWrap-up Overall, I love this bag, and look for every opportunity to bring it with me. In my effort to downsize and travel lightly, I\u0026rsquo;ve found this to be a perfect companion. Every interaction I have with this bag feels great, and makes me smile. If you need something small to bring a few things to your next meeting, concert, or short trip, I highly recommend the DSPTCH Waist Bag. It\u0026rsquo;s seriously good and my suspicion is the rest of their gear is equally great.\n","date":"October, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-10-04-dsptch-waist-bag/","tags":["reviews"],"title":"DSPTCH Waist Bag Review"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Books State Tectonics — Malka Older\nA fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn\u0026rsquo;t love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.\nConvenience Store Woman — Sayaka Murata **\nWow. This book was a lot more bizarre than I expected based on the recommendations I\u0026rsquo;d read—more Abe than H. Murakami. I loved the narrator, and the rich descriptions of convenience store life. This book was hilarious and wild. One of my favorites this year.\nWould You Rather — Katie Heaney\nA touching memoir of coming-out and learning that past dating disinterest was just latent sapphism, lol. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to love about this book, and also quite a bit of cringe. It\u0026rsquo;s a coming-of-age in a way, and overall I\u0026rsquo;d recommend it to young dykes and old, or anyone wondering if their sexuality is \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo;.\nWorth the Wait — Karelia Stetz-Waters *\nThis was a corny AF lesbian romance. Lots of random sex, and a main plot of \u0026ldquo;the cute femme can\u0026rsquo;t come out bc reasons\u0026rdquo;. Nothing groundbreaking, but it was an easy read.\nRecord of a Spaceborn Few — Becky Chambers\nThis was a much slower-paced book than the previous two, and was largely a slice of life about Exodans—the humans who left Earth to take their chances in the universe after Earth became uninhabitable. I enjoyed the various characters, the queer relationships, and the color added to this way of life. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have a space scifi book that isn\u0026rsquo;t full of lasers and danger.\nMovies A Simple Favor\nWhat a silly, fun movie. It ends up in kind of a weird, messy state by the end, as if Feig is like \u0026ldquo;wait, what if they don\u0026rsquo;t remember I made Bridesmaids?!?\u0026rdquo;, but I generally enjoyed seeing Blake Lively be a cool babe, while Anna Kendrick does her thing. All the side-characters were fun, and even though it felt long, it was also consistently enjoyable.\nBlindspotting\nThis is the third movie I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this year that was shot in Oakland, and I loved it. There is so much intensity, and so many parts that made me hold my breath, but everyone in this, especially Daveed Diggs, just showed-up and did an outstanding job. The criticism of gentrification in this felt more present and painful than Sorry to Bother You, and the raw emotional energy between family and friends here was so good.\nThe Nun\nLol, this ridiculous series. My friend got me into this while I was recovering from a surgery last year by asking me to watch all the preceding movies before we went to see one of the Annabelle ones. This series delivers spooky times, jump-scares, and a universe completely devoid of a loving god. I\u0026rsquo;m always down for a movie where the evil folks win, and this series is suitably unclear about who actually comes out on top, so I just claim it for the demons.\nThe Endless\nWhat a bizarre, fantastic film. I loved the world and magic of this movie, as well as the general sense of eerie inevitably. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see the previous film as well. The shots of this film are a mix of dutch angles, handheld, and some neat CGI. There\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit of upsetting stuff in this film, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a fun ride.\n47 Meters Down\nMandy Moore has never scuba-dived, but on a vacation to Mexico, her asshole friend convinces her to scuba in a cage with sharks to forget a man. It goes about as poorly as you’d think. I loved every claustrophobic minute of this. Fuck the ocean, I’m sticking to the rivers and the lakes that I’m used to.\nMary and the Witch\u0026rsquo;s Flower\nA cute anime about a young girl who stumbles into the world of witchcraft.

Today, I am tired, happy, and trying to remember what to do for work when I\u0026rsquo;m not awkwardly wandering around a stadium full of 2000+ people.\nSo. Many. People. This year I was overwhelmed by the size of XOXO in ways I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been in the past. To be fair, two years ago I was only a year into working from home, whereas now I\u0026rsquo;m 3 years a hermit, but still, 2000 people is a lot. It felt like 100-200 people were folks I either knew from Twitter, friends, or Slack, and the \u0026ldquo;should I wave or say hi?\u0026rdquo; feeling that keeps me from going to parties was hugely amplified here. Fortunately, there were good talks, and things that weren\u0026rsquo;t socially awkward to attend. Also, as always, having a friend or two around is a good salve fo my anxiety, and leaving the venue often to eat was vital.\nCool stuff. The games were neat. I only played Plunge, but watching Neo Cab, and untitled goose game was fun. Also, Laura Hall\u0026rsquo;s very good ARG was silly good, with a chill payoff at the end. I felt lucky to do it early, before the 60+ person line after the Andys announced its existence on stage. Open Mike Eagle, Demi, and Janelle Shane gave particularly fun talks. I often felt like the bird in a psychological experiment that dies between two equidistant food bowls, but often just gave-in and stayed at the same thing for a while to avoid zipping to-and-fro.\nThe friends I caught up with were a huge highlight, especially folks I got to eat with and wander around with. It\u0026rsquo;s really helpful to have a small crew that are a known quantity, so when I was out of energy, I knew what to expect. I hosted two friends this time as well, and coming home with them was like returning home with some family. I made the choice more than once to eschew an activity for some time with a few people, and that felt very rewarding.\nNext year  I hope the size of XOXO goes down again next year. If this means more sponsorship, community funding, and other methods for a quarter -\u0026gt; half of the attendees to not pay for a ticket.\n I also hope that there is a little less parallel programming that isn\u0026rsquo;t recorded. Needing to use the restroom, take a break, or eat food often felt like a frustrating trade-off with wanting to see a friend talk or perform.\n Karaoke was good, but the very talented musicians who performed drastically altered the room. Next year, more than one karaoke room could be rad.\n I loved the free soda, but paid alcohol system, especially because it discouraged heavy drinking, I think.\n The bathrooms were about what I expected for a stadium, but I hope next year they\u0026rsquo;re a little less brutalist/low-ceilinged.\n I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Revolution Hall is a better venue, but I definitely missed the outside yard area, because grass fields are nicer than concrete pavilions.\n  Ultimately, I don\u0026rsquo;t envy the Andys any of the planning, listening, or responding they\u0026rsquo;ve spent years doing, and think they\u0026rsquo;ve put together an extremely good, complicated event. I will probably try to attend again in 2019, circumstances permitting. Community is hard.

So many new and old friends will be in my city, wandering around, making and showing art, and eating tons of food. When I first attended XOXO in 2015 I had no idea what to expect. I\u0026rsquo;d been to SXSW for years, growing-up in Austin, but never before had I felt so surrounded by rad, like-minded people. The talks were incredible, the social hangouts were silly fun, and the love at the festival was palatable. At the risk of being too sincerely stoked, XOXO is one of the best things I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended. In the year after my first XOXO, I was lucky to join the XOXO Outpost, which later became The Enthusiasm Collective, and my office away from home. The calibre of people I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to know through XOXO, not least of all, Andy Baio \u0026amp; Andy McMillan, is absurd.\nThree years later, I\u0026rsquo;m gearing-up to host two friends, and see dozens more. Thursday means registration and my first chance to see Cameron Esposito live. Friday, I\u0026rsquo;ll be with Haley \u0026amp; Andy at table 13 of [Level Eater\u0026rsquo;s] special XOXO edition, and then seeing Darth, Helen, and Jenn present Art + Code. Saturday means Jenn \u0026amp; Trinn performing Friendshipping (not that Friendshipping), and Neo Cab. Sunday promises amazing tales from Demi and Claire (https://clairelevans.com). Finally there\u0026rsquo;ll be a closing party with a surprise musical guest, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait.\nOne Year Later Today marks the one year anniversary of my coolest body mod. I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say beyond this being an extremely vital part of many folks lives, and a procedure that absolutely should be covered by medical insurance (single-payer national insurance, obviously). My quality of life has grown immensely since last September, and not being weighed-down by parts of my body have led me to deeply enjoying powerlifting, and getting naked in semi-public places—shout-out to hot springs \u0026amp; weird parties. Major shout-out to my employer, Turbine Labs for being badasses who fought to ensure I\u0026rsquo;d have this coverage, and gave me a month off from work to heal. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have done it without their support.\nThis Fall If you see me at XOXO, wave and say hi. I\u0026rsquo;ll also be in San Francisco a couple times in September, including at Chaos Conf, and later in the year at KubeCon \u0026amp; Envoy Conf which promises to be better than the last Seattle KubeCon, during which a terrible man was elected to the presidency. I look forward to not sobbing uncontrollably in the Modern Art Museum and then smoking too many cigarettes this year. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what else might happen before 2018 closes out, but I\u0026rsquo;m excited and have a great feeling about this Fall.\n","date":"September, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-09-05-3rd-xoxo-and-anniversary/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"3rd XOXO \u0026 1 Year Later"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Books Fingersmith — Sarah Waters\nIn an odd turn of fate, I\u0026rsquo;d seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean director Park Chan-Wook.

It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that\u0026rsquo;s likely because I devoted little time to reading. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I finished this, and recommend it if you love multi-layered, deftly-woven stories.\nEmpire Ascendant — Kameron Hurley\nA wild second installment in the Mirror Empire trilogy that is so chock-full of characters and their (spoiler alert) doubles, that I got a bit confused. There\u0026rsquo;s a glossary and character list in the back, but dang, this is some GoT stuff. I enjoyed the descent into chaos in this book, and I\u0026rsquo;m eagerly anticipating the conclusion(?) in the third. Also one of the only books I know that has a character using ze/hir pronouns, but it also unhelpfully talks about sex as different from and perhaps less malleable than gender, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call this a \u0026ldquo;dope representation of trans folks,\u0026rdquo; so much as \u0026ldquo;well there\u0026rsquo;s some genderqueerness I guess\u0026rdquo;.\nMovies Den of Thieves\nA heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop well. The plot was decently executed, but it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just a movie with lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the couch.\nMasterminds\nA ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Sudekis. It\u0026rsquo;s about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality physical comedy.\nBook Club\nWatched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great?

A+ good job everyone.\nMission Impossible Fallout\nA wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I love this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and passionately.\nReady Player One\nI blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch.

I was made fun of for being \u0026ldquo;chubby\u0026rdquo; in middle school, and that stuck with me. Being fat or chubby or skinny all rule, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that as a kid. I just thought I was broken, bc I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a flat chest or whatever the other kids did at 12. I used to worry about my weight all the time, and no matter what I ate, or didn\u0026rsquo;t eat, I kept some love-handles. Eventually I got used to my body, and now I love it. There\u0026rsquo;s a longer story there, but generally not wanting to be \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; kept me away from weights, and on a bike.\nPresent day I still keep track of my weight, but on a longer time-scale, and these days, it\u0026rsquo;s less about getting down to a number, and more in line with general health-tracking. I did yoga regularly for around three years, but I never felt stronger, just usually more calm, which rules too. Last summer, I read The Myth of Bodyweight Training and then a bunch of posts from Casey about powerlifting, and thought, \u0026ldquo;ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll try this\u0026rdquo;. I heard about Bold \u0026amp; Badass from some XOXO friends, and went in for a session. Then I went back, and back, and back. I took off some time last year due to an unrelated surgery, and a trip to Japan in January, but since February, I\u0026rsquo;ve gone two days a week on average, with July and August being closer to three, and four most days. It feels great, and I feel both stronger and happier while there and on rest days. The focus and calm I found during yoga is present during powerlifting, but I can also track progress, which I enjoy because I\u0026rsquo;m a nerd.\nWTF is \u0026ldquo;powerlifting\u0026rdquo;? Simply put: bench-pressing, squatting, and deadlifting. I usually do accessory workouts and a lot of stuff that gets my heart-rate up for cardio health, but those three lifts are the crux of powerlifting, and in competition, the total of the 3 weights lifted are what your\u0026rsquo;e judged on. It rules. There\u0026rsquo;s so much complexity and muscle memory involved in doing these lifts well, and it\u0026rsquo;s really helpful to have a trainer, and start very light. But, once you get the hang of it, you end up lifting more than you would ever imagine.\nGains? I still remember my first sessions bench-pressing ~80lbs, squatting ~100lbs, and deadlifting 65lbs (the bar + 10lbs on each side to lift it up). These days I\u0026rsquo;m very proud to be bench-pressing 175, squatting 245, and deadlifting 345. It\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of work to get to this point, but I can see the progress. My gym is doing a summer of strength at this point, and that means a specific linear training regimen that means each time I lift with my arms (bench/OHP), I add 2.5lbs, and each time I lift with my legs (squat/DL), I add 5 lbs. Once we get to a place where we can\u0026rsquo;t do a 3rd set of 5, after first trying for a third set of 5-10 for as many weeks as possible, we unload by 10% and start over. It\u0026rsquo;s freeing knowing what I\u0026rsquo;m going to lift before I start each day, and having the encouragement of all the awesome folks in my gym as we all strive to improve our personal numbers. Our competition is with ourselves, largely, and that\u0026rsquo;s the most fun kind, in my opinion.\nLifting is silly I want to be clear that the benefits to my mental and physical health also come with a new type of self-aware humor about the whole thing. Gyms are weird, and lifting heavy stuff is particularly silly. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky that a lot of my coworkers also love powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting (clean \u0026amp; jerks, and snatches), so we can laugh even as we cheer each other on. Being able to enjoy things, and laugh at/with them is super important to me. Plus, have you seen the long socks for sumo? JK, they rule.\nGetting started If you\u0026rsquo;re stoked on lifting at all, and you\u0026rsquo;re in Portland, come join me at Bold \u0026amp; Badass, or find a body-positive gym in your area. If you read this, but still have zero interest, then\u0026hellip; thanks for reading?\n","date":"August, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-08-14-powerlifting/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"powerlifting"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" A few years ago, after moving to Portland, I discovered a secret: you can do almost anything alone. I\u0026rsquo;d lived in Austin for most of my life, and as I quickly learned once moving, making friends in Portland is a long process. So, on a whim, I started seeing movies by myself. I went to dinner alone with a book. I even saw concerts\u0026hellip; solo, and it was fun. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why we all think you have to do these activities with other people, but when you go alone you don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for anyone to be ready to go, or to leave. There\u0026rsquo;s no coordination necessary, and if you want to talk to someone, you can always text or use Slack. At dinner, I usually bring a book, and just relax with whatever author I\u0026rsquo;m reading at the time. It\u0026rsquo;s magical.\nThis last weekend, I went to two shows: one alone, and one with a new friend I met in SF at Karaoke who lives in Portland—Hi Mehan.\nHop Along \u0026amp; Thin Lips Friday was Hop Along, with Thin Lips opening. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen either of these Philly bands before, but they were both excellent. Thin lips is a punk-y band with a rad queer lady lead singer, who covers chosen family, dating, and anxiety. I\u0026rsquo;d never heard of them before this show, but now they\u0026rsquo;re on a regular rotation in my headphones. Hop Along is a favorite of mine since their first album, and Frances\u0026rsquo; voice was incredible in person. They have a sound that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to discuss, so I hope you listen. Her voice is singular, and hella powerful. I usually have at least one of their songs humming in my head any given week while I grocery shop, or go on walks. I stood and danced a bit for both of these bands, and in between, I read on my Kindle iOS app, when I might\u0026rsquo;ve made small talk. There were a LOT of couples at this show, many of them queer, which ruled. Seeing bands is kinda cool as a date, in my experience, because how often do you get to quietly enjoy something with a loved one?\nDeafheaven Sunday night, I saw Deafheaven, who\u0026rsquo;re kind of \u0026ldquo;metal for folks who don\u0026rsquo;t like metal\u0026rdquo;. They\u0026rsquo;re sick, and both times I\u0026rsquo;ve seen them they play and sing their hearts out. Bonus points for Geroge, the lead singer, growing out his hipster haircut into some serious 90s metal locks. Headbanging just works better with long hair. Hung with my friend in between sets, and made dumb jokes. The openers weren\u0026rsquo;t really my jam, but Deafheaven put on such a wild long set, I immediately forgot about the first hour or so of so-so music.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got a few more shows coming up this year, and I\u0026rsquo;m stoked AF to see Mitski, especially.\n","date":"August, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-08-13-august-shows/","tags":null,"title":"two concerts"},{"categories":"blog","contents":"Inspired by both Nick and Matt, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to try my hand at blogging again on this site.

I absolutely loved this. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t listened to the podcast, but if you haven\u0026rsquo;t, get on it\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s free and it\u0026rsquo;s delightful.\nLa Bastarda — Trifonia Melibea Obono *\nA lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself falling for another woman. The first half was full of build-up and world-building, but the back half felt like a very rushed piece, as though Trifonia was hoping to get it all out in a final effort. I enjoyed this book, but the bits that were glossed over about Okomo\u0026rsquo;s journeys, her grandfather\u0026rsquo;s death, and other scenes could\u0026rsquo;ve been fleshed-out.\nBlackfish City — Sam J. Miller **\nThis book ruled, and I was super surprised at how much I loved it. Absolutely riveting, and a blast. The individual characters felt very distict, and were easy to follow, and the world felt really interesting.\nMovies Drive Angry\nThere are probably worse Nic Cage movies, but this is the worst one I\u0026rsquo;ve seen. Every scene is painfully bad.\nTomb Raider\nFun, and very surprisingly entertaining for a video game movie. Lots of \u0026ldquo;oh, I could see how this would play in the game,\u0026rdquo; scenes. Alicia Vikander is a much better Lara Croft too, imo.\nSorry to Bother You\nThis is the movie Idiocracy wishes it were. Sorry to Bother You skewers tech culture, bay-area poverty, racial injustice, and so much more. Throughout, Tessa, Lakeith, and the rest of the cast deliver awesome performances. A mix of chilling and laugh-inducing. One of the best films I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this year.\nTragedy Girls\nWhat a wild, fucked-up movie about social media, murder, and friendship. Don\u0026rsquo;t do it for the gram.\nI, Tonya\nFinally watched this with a friend, and wow, it was good but full of very violent abuse stuff. Growing up in the 80s/90s, Tonya Harding was in a lot of news, but this definitely filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of her story.\nVillainess\nWhat a wonderfully bonkers movie. It kicks off with wild first-person murder fest, and just goes off-the-rails from there. One of the bloodier and wilder action films I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a long time. Loved it.\nThe Incredibles 2\nWatched this a few hours after the first one. The animation has gotten a LOT better, even though the first one honestly aged pretty well, since they didn\u0026rsquo;t try to make it photorealistic. The plot was ridiculous again, and they definitely leaned hard into the \u0026ldquo;men are bad at childcare\u0026rdquo; shit that I suspected they would. Fun enough though anyways.\nThe Incredibles\nThe animation holds up surprisingly well for a few year-old movie, even if the plot depends on some pretty annoying misogynist tropes. I watched this to prep for the new movie, and overall it was a fun, if ridiculous, movie.\nAnt Man \u0026amp; the Wasp\nThis was a hoot. Very silly, and pretty PG, but above all else, this felt like a comic movie. I\u0026rsquo;d compare this to Spiderman Homecoming or a less stylish Thor Ragnarok. Great summer night movie.\nSicario\nWhat a wild movie, in which I needed to completely suspend all of my feelings about America, the \u0026ldquo;drug war\u0026rdquo; and Thanos. If you can attempt to not emotionally connect to the actual monsters in this movie, it\u0026rsquo;s kinda fun in a \u0026ldquo;tense film where things blow up\u0026rdquo; kind of way.\nGemini\nLesbian murder mystery? Yes. This was fun, even if the music felt super weird at times. Good bangs. Cool cars. A movie where men are the worst. Also this seems consistent with the choices and habits of geminis, so, lol. shots fired.\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\nLol, this movie was absurd. They rushed off the island and so many of the subplots never really paid off? I can\u0026rsquo;t forget that Pratt is a conservative, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really care much about anyone in this film, except for the dinosaurs. I guess I was rooting for the dinosaurs, and I figure they probably came out ahead.\n","date":"July, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2018-07-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"july"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books Swearing Off Stars — Danielle Wong\nStarted off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t really be with you until it\u0026rsquo;s too late\u0026rdquo; lesbian novel. I also kept thinking an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was an odd read, and the time-jumps didn\u0026rsquo;t help. If you can write a lesbian romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying? Super annoying. It was a pretty quick read at least. Read for a lesbian book club.\nLittle Fish — Casey Plett\nOutstanding and devastating. This is a book full of people I\u0026rsquo;ve known,\nslept with, and smiled at across the room. Family is a tenuous thing, and Little Fish finds space for it throughout. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I would\u0026rsquo;ve made with this years ago, but now, it\u0026rsquo;s a sad and good ache. I hope Casey keeps writing, and sharing her work with us for years to come. I read this in one go, and it was a wild ride that had me laughing and crying.\nPaprika — Yasutaka Tsutsui\nA fantastically bizarre story of science, dreams, desire, and the smallness of men. I\u0026rsquo;d seen the anime adapted from this book years ago, so I had some predisposition towards envisioning characters a certain way, but this book goes to way different places than I remember the movie going. I liked this quite a bit, save for the weird shit with sexual assault. Like many books written by a guy, it shows.\nInfidel — Kameron Hurley\nReally loving this series about a tough AF bounty hunter lady named Nyx. The world-building is pretty interesting, and the story moves forward at a pretty good clip. All-told, this is a fun sci-fi action novel.\nMovies Solo\nThis was probably tied with Last Jedi for my least favorite of the new Star Wars, but I liked it better than pretty much any of the old or prequel ones. It was fun, had a few rad women, and didn\u0026rsquo;t go overboard on \u0026ldquo;remember this?\u0026rdquo; fanservice. I laughed a few times, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they make sequels.\nAppropriate Behavior\nThis was a fun movie about being a Persian Bisexual woman in NYC. Shirin goes through a major breakup, then struggles to date, and heal, while dealing with a family she doesn\u0026rsquo;t think will understand her queerness, and the strange world of the NYC queer and poly scene. I laughed out loud during a lot of this, even as I scratched my head at the confusing references to trans guys—like, why are they a joke? Overall, I dug this movie, and hope the director/writer Desiree makes more films soon.\nRed Sparrow\nI will never believe for one second that the protagonist would fall for Joel Edgerton\u0026rsquo;s bland spyman. For some reason, I expected this movie to be set during the cold war, but instead it\u0026rsquo;s vaguely now. This had more sexual assault than I expected too, which is a fucking bummer. The saving grace in this film is that by and large Jennifer Lawrence kills or beats all the men in the movie. I can only hope she gets cast in more movies where she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to participate in misogynist porn first.\nUnlocked\nI\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for middling spy movies, and Noomi Rapace, so I now own this film. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t great, but it was fun, and dammit, sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s all I need. TIL Michael Douglas is still around.\nxx\nTerrible title unless everyone involved had to get a karyotype test to be involved. Most of the horror was related to having kids, which meant this movie hit me hard, because kids are the worst and deeply frightening on the best days.\nOcean\u0026rsquo;s 8\nAll. Ladies. Heist. A+. I hope everyone involved in this comes out as gay. Points for literally every outfit, and double points for Rhianna\u0026rsquo;s devil-may-care overalls, and Cate Blanchett\u0026rsquo;s Carol-as-a-Timelord character.\nOh Lucy!\nThis movie ruled! The world feels pretty rough these days, and this movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t shy away from difficult topics, but the overarching feeling of Oh Lucy is a kind and happy one. It was also cool seeing an actor I\u0026rsquo;ve watched in lots of Kiyoshi Kurasawa films show up in a very rad role.\n","date":"June, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2018-06-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"june"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books Lab Rat One — Andrea Höst\nOk, this series is exceedingly straight, and that\u0026rsquo;s a bummer. I wish there was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten slightly sick of the cycles of \u0026ldquo;power then injury\u0026rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to finish this out.\nCaszandra — Andrea Höst\nUgh, I wanted to enjoy the rest of this story, but this book was so exceedingly dull. I loathe that the main character was setup to not only get married, but have kids at ~19 years old. Fuck that. This series started off well, but ended up being even worse than Twilight. Read the first book, and skip the rest.\nSpace Opera — Catherynne M. Valente\nUproariously fun, and silly throughout. Take Douglas Adams, add in some queerness, and an obsession with Eurovision. Loved this from start to finish. I devoured the back-half of this book in one sitting at a cafe in Copenhagen, and found myself crying in the afterword/credits.\nGold, Fame, Citris — Claire Vaye Watkins\nInteresting book about a post-apocalyptic wasteland America and the ideas of survival and family. I enjoyed this.\nGods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach — Kelly Robson\nA cool scifi short novel where the future is barren, but at least there\u0026rsquo;s time-travel. I wanted more world-building, and probably a couple more books in this story, but that also means I liked this book quite a bit. The back half of the book felt much faster than the lead-up, and much of the action was compacted, but it was a fun adventure. This is a solid addition to the burgeoning eco-scifi genre.\nMovies Geostorm\nA trash movie in the best way. If you liked watching Jake Gylenhall run from ice in The Day After Tomorrow, and people saying \u0026ldquo;zap!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;geostorm!\u0026rdquo;, then this movie is for you. Continues the trend of big-budget action films being largely targeted for non-US success, but that means we also get some cool co-stars.\nIn the Fade\nOne of the saddest movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s gorgeous, well-shot, and soundtracked, but phew, what a brutal movie about the evils of nazism, and racism.\nAvengers: Infinity War\nThis movie tried to tie together too many disparate stories, to bland effect. The attempt at some sort of emotional climax was a big wet fart, despite ten people in the theater I was in yelling at the screen. Like, spoilers they\u0026rsquo;ll all be back, bc Disney isn\u0026rsquo;t going to kill off their money-makers. Go rewatch Black Panther of Thor Ragnarok, or like, spend 3 hours outside instead.\nDeadpool 2\nAs fun as Avengers: Infinity War was boring and meh. Full of silly jokes. There were definitely jokes that were in really poor taste, but pretty much what I expected.\n","date":"May, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/mediadiet/2018-05-24-media-diet/","tags":["mediadiet"],"title":"may"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Bags are my thing. Well, bags and shoes. Traveling as much as I do, having a dependable, comfortable, and sleek bag is pretty important. For the past two or so years, I\u0026rsquo;ve depended on my Topo Designs Trip Pack for short trips, and then nested it inside of my Ryu QuickPack for longer trips abroad. This has worked out well, but walking around Copenhagen, and going through a variety of international airport security, I wondered if I could consolidate to one bag, with an easier way to access my laptop and other stuff. The Invisible One Mini seemed like a great way to test this out. I was drawn to the design of the bag, and the ethos of the company: \u0026ldquo;Each year we reiterate and improve our designs\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; which I\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed as I\u0026rsquo;ve watched them iterate over the years.\nPockets and zips My Topo Designs Trip Pack has three compartments—a main area where I can slip my laptop, a zip pouch in that main area, and a front pocket for a Kindle, notebook, etc. I found myself digging around more than I wanted to for my charger, pen, or chapstick. The Invisible One Mini has just a little more organization, and so far, it\u0026rsquo;s made a huge difference.\nThe 2018 One Mini has a zipper pocket in the front, that\u0026rsquo;s charmingly asymmetrical. A flap unzips, revealing a pocket that can hold an iPad or Kindle, a zipper-sealable area for keys, chapstick, glasses cloth, etc, and two smaller pouches. These pouches are the perfect size for a portable battery, and a Hobonichi Techo. There\u0026rsquo;s a bit of additional space in the big zipper area for my MacBook charger as well. The entire big pouch is almost the width and heigh of the bag, but because of the clever organization, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I\u0026rsquo;ll lose things in it.\nOn the top of the bag, there\u0026rsquo;s a big zipper that opens the main compartment, which I use to hold a hoodie, my water bottle, and also a small bag of underwear and clothes for travel. Because of the front organization, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to dig in this compartment often, and only need to keep a few easy-to-find or pack-to-leave unpack-at-destination items in it. This is a big improvement over the Topo Bag.\nFinally, the back of the bag has a top-loading laptop sleeve that\u0026rsquo;s soft and felt-lined. The bottom ends a bit above the bottom of the bag, providing a little cushion area, but I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to throw this bag around with my MacBook in it. Unlike the Ryu or the Topo Designs bags, this separate laptop area means I can dig my MacBook out on the occasions I can\u0026rsquo;t get pre-check and have my laptop scanned separately. I try my damndest to avoid these instances, but inter-Europe travel usually means pulling out all my electronics.\nPrevious years of this bag had weird side zips on the front and back for the laptop, a water bottle, and documents and other stuff in the front, but this version feels more usable, and less confusing at a glance. I doubt I\u0026rsquo;ll have any trouble remembering where I put various items, or how to quickly retrieve them. Read more about the year-over-year change here.\nThe material The entire bag is a light-weight 800x600D waterproof nylon-polyester blend that looks and feels pretty lux. The top handle is a rubber-ish leather-is material that\u0026rsquo;s grippy and feels nice, and the inside of the pack straps is a soft and breathable cloth. The top of the bag is ringed with the same rubberized material, encircling the main compartment. The inside of the two front areas is a gray nylon that feels like smooth quality. All over the bag, the stitches are even and seem made for longevity. I\u0026rsquo;ll update this review later to see how well the bag stood up to travel wear-and-tear, but so far it inspires confidence. I\u0026rsquo;m also curious how well the rain resistance does, as only the laptop sleep area has a waterproof YKK zipper, with the other two using a more standard zip. The pulls have rubber grips, with no dangling pull cords, which means they\u0026rsquo;re slightly more fiddly than the RYU or the Topo bags, but once I\u0026rsquo;ve found the tab, the pull feels smooth.\nThe size This is a small bag, but feels a good deal bigger than my tiny Topo Designs bag. Measuring 38cm x 34cm x 14cm (15\u0026rdquo;x13.5\u0026rdquo;x5.5\u0026rdquo;), with a volume of 11L, and a weight of 650g (22oz), it\u0026rsquo;s easy to throw on, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t look dwarfed by my 5\u0026rsquo;10\u0026rdquo; frame. It sits well on my back, and the clever straps let me cinch it up or down, while the excess strap stays tucked into itself. The main compartment is roomy enough without making the other areas of the bag feel cramped, that I feel pretty confident I could take only this bag for a few weeks abroad.\nWrap-up I haven\u0026rsquo;t had this bag for long, but my first impressions are that this will be a major part of my travel kit. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to bring this with me to Oakland, or Japan, to see how well it fits under a seat, or loads and unloads in a crowded subway train.\n","date":"May, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-05-17-review-invisible-one-mini/","tags":["reviews"],"title":"Invisible One Mini backpack review"},{"categories":"mediadiet","contents":" Books All Systems Red — Martha Wells\nPretty fun book about a \u0026ldquo;murderbot\u0026rdquo; who would rather be watching tv dramas than shooting anything.

Unlike Texts from Jane Eyre, his first book of imagined text conversations from literary characters, this reader at least felt prepared for these fables, stories, and tall-tales through study of European folklore. Even more, each story brought a sly smile to my face as I discovered the layers of joyful twisting of stories well and lesser-known.\n“Fear Not: An Incident Log” tells of a heavenly bureaucrat who, they assure us, “(has) never once been reprimanded for how I comport myself under the sun.” We spend the story learning of the machinations of a certain kind of supernatural world, adjacent to the typical christian god, angels, and satan. As I read this story, I laughed out loud in public, and felt a welling of joy.\nAnother tale that wormed its soft, velveteen pages into my heart was “The Rabbit” — about a boy who gives his love to a toy that may or may not be sucking the life force of the child away. It’s devilish fun. Each story in this collection has a sparkle in its eye, and just a bit of dirt on its face, as if to say, “Who, me? I couldn’t have broken the window, Ms., as I studied all day.” This is a collection for rascals, miscreants, and students of folktale who smoked behind the liberal arts building, and threw rocks at their shadow.\nAs a reader, I tore through these tales quickly, but as with any fairytale, I plan to revisit these regularly, until their devilish stories take the place of better known tellings. Ortberg surely has a gift, revealed by his early work in frightening children’s tales on The Toast, but for his sophomore publication, I can see a writer hitting his stride, and stretching his legs. I can’t wait to see what further fictions he brings us. The Merry Spinster is a triumph.\n","date":"March, 2018","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2018-03-13-merry-spinster-review/","tags":null,"title":"A review of the Merry Spinster"},{"categories":"blog","contents":"Note: This was a cunt-up piece, so it was delivered in chunks, read out of a hat, interspersed with Cooper Lee Bombardier’s piece about the same time period/culture. As such, it’s a little disjointed. Enjoy~\nA time and a place I wasn’t part of, but read about eagerly. The drugs, the fucking, and the sisterhood that I dreamed of from my bed in Texas. I wouldn’t have been accepted, I know, because of who I am. At the time, I was closeted, and scared. At the time I was falling for my straight friends, and stealing clothes to feel a little more whole. The music that got me through was Tori, Ani, PJ. I didn’t know enough about your books, but now when I read them, I feel a pang of nostalgia for a time I missed — for something that can only exist as a perfect picture of a time gone by. I would have gotten so fucked up. I like to think that if I existed then I would have partied with you. I like to think that somehow I could get around the politics of exclusion that were so often a part of your world. The fashion of that time is back, and when I wear my docs with a short skirt, I think, there’s still time. Valencia isn’t the same as it was, but I still roam that street, getting tattooed and kissing so many girls.\nI flag every day. I see other dykes, and wink. I pick girls up, and make sure gloves are in my bag. My transsexuality is not a debt I owe anyone — it’s a deep felt bank of energy and power. I teach and learn from other women, and in this way, I join a line of sisterhood that ties back to yours.\nThe dykes I know don’t always know of their elders, their roots in culture. They fuck, write, and dance to the tunes and the works of your peers. Our youths are all fleeting, but we live them forever through the words we speak and put down to paper.\nMy 30s are a chance to relive my 20s — back then I couldn’t live the way I needed to, and I felt so alone. Now I fly around the world and revel in my dyke magic. We learned from you — we learned that so many of the drugs and smokes you took are anathema to us now. We live in fear of tomorrow, but also in the hope that we might have one. Our crisis is global, where yours was personal. We fight for the trans women of color, the sex workers, the women that are murdered every day, and you fought for space, and against a disease that seemed to kill everyone it touched. \u0026gt; # “She swaggers down the streets in her leather at night, you like the way she mounts her Harley Davison bike. Jump on the back, she gives it a rev, don’t think she’s gonna top you, cos she’s belly up in bed.” — Tribe 8\nExcept, I’m not. At least not every time. I top, and am topped. My gender and my sex are both more expansive than the binaries of top/bottom. I am a switch. a Dyke that loves to be inside and for you to be inside. A fist fills me up, and it says “you exist.”\nI didn’t know about Riot Grrl until after it had shifted, become something else. I saw Kathleen Hanna speak recently, and she said “we need to do something better, we need to make sure that when we say ‘all girls to the front, we mean PoC, we mean trans women.’” \u0026gt; # “But you can’t stop the fire that burns \u0026gt; # Inside of me \u0026gt; # You think I don’t know \u0026gt; # I’m here to tell you \u0026gt; # I do” — Bikini Kill\nThe trans men I know are often from your time — they learned and grew, and at times they feel like big brothers. I learn the secrets, the handshakes from them. They introduce me to the heroes I would have if I had heroes. They made space for themselves, and didn’t make space for us, but I don’t really blame them. We are all fighting for ourselves at the end of the day, and for my brothers, I often think they just wanted to live another day, more comfortable than the day before. Maybe we deserve some comfort, but I don’t know if we deserve community. Community comes from shared experience, yes, but mostly it comes from fighting, fucking, and talking together. It’s hard won, it’s built on pain and history. We can build a new community that takes the best of your past, and the best of mine, and opens its doors for all of our loves, all our trans siblings.\nStealth is a word we both roll our eyes at. We know why folks do it, and safety is a real problem, but to get rid of our histories? to hide from our pasts? Instead we hope to embrace ourselves as a whole, and remember even the bad times. It’s harder, and it hurts, but we grow so much more than if we pretended we were born whole-cloth, that the desperate times, grasping for the truth, had never occured.\n","date":"April, 2016","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2016-04-16-sister-spit-piece-pre-cunt-up/","tags":null,"title":"sister spit"},{"categories":"blog","contents":"no cis men, says the sign on the door and i read, prove yourself are you woman enough to enter this building not woman like dresses but woman like a body you didn’t get for free the feeling that these spaces want to spit us out like we won’t be safe from the pain of judgement because it follows us in and comes out through their eyes\ndo you see me? do you see what I am trying to do? who i am, and what i am am i more to you than a token or just a tragic figure am i someone you could fuck someone you could fall in love with can i come to your party and feel at home?\nthey check my id and find the F the sign they look for to say “you’re good” but i see the glint of doubt in your eyes when i say thanks and my voice sounds just a little too deep the foot to head look they give doesn’t read as checking me out so much as vetting my existence i feel a shiver of fear, and swallow it down\ni dance and flirt as armor against the other this belonging feels like a battle and i am not one to give up easy\n","date":"April, 2016","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2016-04-15-no-cis-men/","tags":["poems"],"title":"no cis men"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Why I choose to travel with a 16L bag everywhere I go.\nThe Past Years ago, I stopped checking bags when I flew. I’d seen too many things get lost over the years, my own and other’s, and couldn’t stomach the thought of landing somewhere again, only to lose all my possessions. So, I began using a canvas duffel bag, as well as a small backpack.\nThe bag is grey, and around 30L in volume, has little toggle closures, and a couple internal pockets. It was great for trips in the car to Dallas to see my partner at the time’s family, or anywhere that I didn’t need to carry it. But it was horrible for planes and walking.\nFor a while, I just dealt with the shoulder pain and annoyance of a single, cross-chest strap full of gear, in addition to my backpack. But it hurt, and I didn’t really like the way I looked, carrying two different bags. I still felt much better about my setup than I would with a large rectangle of soon-to-be-lost gear, but I wanted to simplify more.\nA note on my able-bodied privilege This choice to carry a smaller bag, regardless of weight, is one that I was able to make because of my body. For those with chronic pain, or difficulty carrying weight on their back for whatever reason, my setup will likely not work. I see a lot of folks get frustrated with rolling bags, and I have shared that sentiment in the past, but it is very shitty to the folks who need those bags for any reason.\nSimplify your gear Pack lighter by packing less\nClothing The first thing I did to simplify, was to see what I could live without. Many of the extras that I was sure of needing got tossed. No more extra shoes for a trip. No more than the number of underwear I would need for the trip (and often less — it’s easy to hand-wash). Two bras (Nude label). A couple shirts that could also be hand-washed easily (yoga tank-tops from Lucy). Wool socks, usually two pairs. With my wardrobe thus whittled, I turned to my love of books.\nBooks In the past I always brought at least 3 books with me on trip of more than 3 or 4 days, as I’d likely go through all of them. Books are heavy. Like, really heavy, and not very easy to pack tightly, especially if they’re lengthy. A Kindle helped fix that problem immediately. I bought the cheapest one, with ads, and loaded it up with a few books I’d acquired over the years, and some free ones from Project Gutenberg. I don’t like giving my money to Amazon, but there are other ways to buy books that support independent bookstores. Now I could carry as many books as I wanted, and acquire new ones instantly, without needing to add to the weight of my pack. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the smell and feel of books, and have a library at home that I treasure, but just like my other stuff, I don’t need to travel with everything I care about.\nElectronics When it came to electronics, I was already pretty lightweight. I had the ability to afford a Macbook Air, and learned that each year I could sell the previous one and buy a new one for ~100 dollars or so if I kept it from getting banged up. This 13\u0026rdquo;, slim laptop could go most anywhere with me with a minimal strain on my back. I had a slender Tom Bhin sleeve for it, and its charger. I also had my iPhone, my Kindle (as mentioned above), and a small USB cable for both. In recent years, I’ve switched to the Macbook, which is even smaller and lighter than the Air. My company bought me a Kindle Paperwhite, so now I can read on dark planes with minimal disturbance. I also purchased an Anker powercore 15600 that can charge my phone ~6 times before needing to be charged itself. It’s a little heavy, but has made a huge difference in how I travel, as I don’t need to worry as much about finding an outlet when I am sure to need directions and contact with folks via Twitter, email, or text. For headphones, I’ve always loved in-ear ones, but on long flights, they are painful at best. I got a pair of **ATH-M40Xs **that I adore, and usually wear them around my neck when I’m not listening to them on trips. When I get where I am traveling, I often leave them in the room and switch to my RHA 10Ti in-ear-monitors. There are better headphones for the price, but these work well for me, and most-importantly, fit into my phone while the case is on it, unlike my Shure 215k that I previously wore everywhere.\nThe final electronic device I bring is a vibrator. At home, I have quite the array, and particularly love my wireless Magic Wand. But, taking a note from a friend about not becoming dependent on what amounts to a power tool, I travel with the easily-packed JimmyJane Form 2. It does the trick, has a travel mode (so it doesn’t vibrate in my bag), and is waterproof to boot.\nOther clothes When I go anywhere with either changeable temperature, or the likelihood of rain, I bring my **Ilse Jacobsen Raincoat 50 **jacket. It’s black, minimally adorned, and waterproof. I love it. Before I had this jacket, I always brought my older Marmot Precip, which could be stowed in my bag easily, unlike this new jacket. With warmer weather, I will probably return to that jacket, for ease of carry.\nYoga pants are the best. For both comfort on the plane, and versatile city exploring, I always bring a pair of yoga leggings that are black, and durable. The ones I have now are from Lucy, but anything will do. With these, my socks, and the yoga tanks I wear, the key is wicking. I sweat easily, and don’t always have a great way to wash clothes, so having clothing that stays pretty stink-free, and dry, is a huge plus. It also packs down really easily due to the thinness of the fabric. You might want something a little thicker if you get cold more easily. Sometimes I bring wool tights too, to wear under these or my jeans.\nFor pants, I also bring a pair of high-waisted, stretchy black jeans. This is a style choice, but I love them. I pack these in my bag while flying, and then wear them around half the time I’m on my trip. I also bring a small pair of shorts (Foxers), for sleeping and wandering around my hotel, or hostel.\nToiletries I don’t wear much makeup, and that means my toiletry packing is pretty straightforward. I bring a stick of eyeliner, a stick of lipstain, some coconut-oil deodorant, essential oil, and a toothbrush. I pack these in the front pocket of my backpack, along with my medicine, and some hand-sanitizer for those times I have no idea where to wash my hands, but want to eat.\nI also bring a water bottle, which is a Hydroflask, but have thought about getting a collapsable water bottle, the Vapur, soon. (Edit: I got a Vapor bottle, and it’s amazing. It can fold up and fit in the small front zipper of my Fjalraven bag along with the makeup and pill-bottle I keep in there. A+)\nThe bag I switch between two bags these days, depending on condition. If there will be a lot of rain, or I expect my bag to get jostled significantly, I bring my Mission Workshop 21L Sancturary bag. It’s super durable, and has held up to international travel and mistreatment in my often clumsy hands, and stayed strong for the past 6 years or so. In an effort to get even lighter, as well as have something cuter to walk around cities like NYC with, I picked up a Fjalraven Kånken bag. At 16L, it’s pretty small, but I can still fit all my packed gear inside. My only complaint with this bag, is that with my stuff in it, it can be difficult to get my laptop out in the TSA line. I never dealt with this problem using my Mission Workshop bag, because it has a folding top, that allows for easy access to the laptop in the back. The Fjalraven is a zipper system at the front of the bag, so I have to roll the top back with it unzipped to pull out my laptop. I’m considering cutting the bag and adding another zipper, but we’ll see. It’s less of a problem with the bag less tightly packed, so it’s likely this will just lead to me packing a little bit less each time, and that’s not so bad.\nFinal recommendation: Years ago I read an article written by a designer who decided to travel without any clothes, save for enough underwear to get her through the trip. She loved the opportunity to hit up a thrift store and buy interesting outfits, which she would re-sell, or donate at the end of her trip. She figured she was saving hassle by not bringing extra clothes, and saving money, potentially, by not needing to check a bag. I love this idea, but as a woman who has a hard time finding well-fitting clothes (I’m 5\u0026rsquo;10, athletic, and wide-hipped), I don’t want to take that kind of risk. But, if you love shopping, have a frame that is more welcoming to thrift clothes, and feel ok with buying and getting rid of these temporary outfits, then I recommend trying her style of light packing. You might find that the short-lived nature of these clothes inspire you to make riskier or more interesting choices, and maybe even mailing a few pieces back home.\nWrap up There are many reasons why I’ve decided to pack as light as I do, and it’s become a thing I both enjoy and find ways to challenge as I continue to travel regularly. Questioning the stuff I own, and finding a way to make cute outfits with limited options is a fun way to make the most of a limited budget, or a temporarily limited wardrobe. A lot of folks I know love to bring large bags with extra shoes, more clothes than they wear, and options for most gear. I’m glad they found what works for them, but I’m also very happy to have figured out a minimal pack that feel like I have enough for a week or two. However you decide to pack, light, heavy, or not at all, I hope you enjoy your travels, take some pictures, and breath.\n","date":"April, 2016","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2016-04-14-pack-light-and-still-enjoy-the-trip/","tags":["backpacks"],"title":"pack light and still enjoy the trip"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Marginally better! 2015: it sounds like we’re really moving\nScore 2015/?\n","date":"December, 2015","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-12-19-my-year-end-review-of-2015/","tags":["review"],"title":"my year-end review of 2015"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" New York is my home for two months out of the year, but I only recently became acquainted with it. Growing up in Texas, I got the idea from my dad that NYC was some kind of devil city. He regarded it as a liberal place with people who walked too fast, and were too greedy. The first time I visited in my mid-twenties, I realized just how wrong he was.\nMy first visit At this point, I was liberal myself, and the city didn’t seem particularly evil to me. There were people literally EVERYWHERE, though in less quantities than Taipei and Chennai, both of which I visited before NYC. The density of any of those cities is slightly overwhelming for me, as I’m happier in a group of 2–6 people, but I learned quickly that I can put my headphones on and they disappear. To a degree, music makes the city feel like a river that I’m floating through or a strange movie set. Interactions with strangers aren’t necessary in the way that waving at folks on the street seems normal in Portland or Texas. In a way, I found the anonymity and brusqueness refreshing.\nFood As a food nerd, I also find the ubiquity of delicious meals incredibly appealing, though I will never get used to the constant lines and hype around restaurants who can only hope to fit a handful of people at a time, ensuring long waits. Still, I feast each time I visit my 2nd home. Often I will pick a particular cuisine, and try to find the 5 best examples of its preparation, be it ramen, izakaya food, or southern fried chicken. Food tourism is a major industry from what I can tell. Food isn’t cheap, but then neither is anything else in NYC. I budget to spend $60 a day in NYC on food alone, and many times I’ve blown right by that. I’d imagine if I lived there more regularly, I would cook more often, but the temptations of restaurants and carts is too high for me to pass up during each visit. I’ve yet to dive into the fine-dining scene, as I’m loathe to wear heels or hose, but I’ve heard great things about upscale restuarants. For now, I think I’ll stick to the sub-$10 congee bowl with youtiao.\nGetting around A huge part of my love of the city is the transport. Many of my friends in NYC seem to avoid the subway, opting for Uber, taxis, or bicycles, but I love it. To me, trains are a pinnacle of old, cool technology. They’re dependable (largely), safe (except occasionally from scary folks), and inexpensive. Waiting on the platform, or slumped in a molded plastic seat, I have time to read books, listen to music, and contemplate hard problems at work or in life. In a city that moves so quickly, these brief pauses are my respite. Without them, I don’t think I could handle the bustle or the pace of NYC.\nMemento mori That said, I think the city wants us dead. The distinct sense I get from NYC is one of antagonism. The people can be ok at times, but the city itself pulses with too much, and too harsh. Not only are there actual dangers in the city, but the sheer speed at which everything is moving ensures that if you stumble emotionally, physically, or in spirit, the weight of the city-as-inexorable-movement will grind you into dust. Perhaps the industry or part of New York you encounter on a daily basis can mitigate this for a time, but by and large, NYC is hard to thrive in. High rents, cold winters, humid-as-hell summers, and complex transit — if you are thinking of visiting or moving from a sleepy locale, test the waters in a few seasons first.\nFinally For myself, making friends was the most important part of enjoying my time in NYC. They ensure that I have activities in the city or in Brooklyn, as well as support and kind faces. With growing familiarity and the increased time I spend in the city, I now love it as a second home, and am excited to drop in for a few weeks at a time, to partake in the drug of NYC. And I’m equally happy to fly home, disembark from the plane, and breath in the cool, crisp air of Portland.\n","date":"November, 2015","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-11-9-nyc-my-second-home/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"NYC"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Arrival\n“This conference is GIGANTIC!” was my first thought upon arriving at Grace Hopper. This year’s attendance was around 10,000 folks, mostly women, and the largest conference besides SXSW that I’ve attended. Like many tech conferences, GHC had an invaluable app that showed a stream of comments from attendees as well as a schedule and other information. Once I signed in, I spent a lot of time networking and finding folks from out of town as my chosen track “Open-Source” was largely bereft of personally relevant content. Like most of the tracks, the content was focused around introductory ideas and concepts more suited to students just entering the tech world. GHC also boasted a huge job fair, and walking around was pleasantly surreal as it was comprised of 99% women, unlike just about any large room I’ve been in.\nPanel My panel was very well received. It took place in an 500 person auditorium (super daunting), but our attendence was closer to 150. I spoke with my book’s editor Elissa Shevinsky, Ellen Spertus from Mills College (late of Google), and Dom DeGuzman from Twilio. Our topic was how to work with and around HR when you are in an oppressed or marginalized group, and despite the rather somber subject, there were laughs and later tears as our attendees came to talk to us and thank us. I was able to discuss the very important role of intersectionality when doing feminist work, and participating in diversity/inclusion discussions. I also brought to light some practical ways to include and help trans folks.\nHighlights? Two particular highlights in meeting people were Isis Anchalee, who started #ilooklikeanengineer, and Megan Smith, the CTO of America. There was also an LGBT (though I’m not sure why the G existed for a women’s conference) meetup at the convention center, and the turnout of around 80 women was heartening.\nThe future Due to the nature of speaking and my suspicion that the conference content wouldn’t be incredibly applicable, I only attended one day of it. From talking to my friends, it sounds like I didn’t miss anything too great. I think Grace Hopper could still become a wonderful conference, but for now it is primarily centered on hiring and introductory talks for white and asian-american cisgender heterosexual women. It’s unfortunate that both the size, and leadership of the conference preclude many sessions that would be beneficial, or smaller talks that could be more intimate and informative. I filled out feedback forms with honest content, and I hope that GHC and Anita Borg take note, and that next year is marginally better.\nI’ll end with a quote from a woman who spoke to me tearfully after my talk: “I was so happy to be here at a conference with women, but I’m realizing just how many of us it still leaves out and doesn’t help or include.”\n","date":"October, 2015","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-10-19-thoughts-on-grace-hopper/","tags":["thoughts"],"title":"Thoughts on Grace Hopper Conference"},{"categories":"blog","contents":" Due to stress, the talk I am about to give usually overshadows the talks before mine. Fortunately, LWT was such a jam-packed speaker event that I was able to tune into the talks and not get eaten by nerves. There were a neat mix of 5 minute ignite talks about things like tackling systemic oppression, government tech work, and imposter syndrome. Some of these talks were similar to others I’ve heard, and the audience was so different than what I usually experience at a conference that I was a little sad we didn’t get past some of the 101 talks.\nIt’s certainly possible that many of the women and other folks there were hearing about imposter syndrome or trans-inclusiveness for the first time, but I’d love to have more talks that dig into the meat of intersectional feminism in tech.\nA few talks In the morning of Friday, there was a neat presentation by Diane Feinberg of Pixar on how they handle lighting and building a scene into something more than just 3D renderings. The interview right before I spoke was with a senior Amazon employee concerning the NYTimes story, and she was able to add color and detail to both how the story turned out against the actual quotes and information given to the reporter, as well as what she’s changed since then.\nAfter my talk, Edith Windsor was a particular delight, and had more than a few of us tearing up at her description of being a closeted gay woman at IBM in the 60s.\nGenerally I generally enjoyed the conference, but wish the compressed Friday schedule spread more evenly over Saturday and Sunday, instead of making them largely social/hackathon. I was also a little saddened to see banks so heavily represented in the recruiting area, but this is also my first NYC conference, so perhaps that is typical.\nTL;DR Overall, I think this is a worthwhile conference, and I am going to try to attend the SF summit as well in February.

It helped so much that we had Slack setup for XOXO months in advance. I met tons of rad people in and around the tech industry while I was online, and then when the XOXO started, I was prepared with a group of new and old friends.\nThe Talks The festival’s talks focussed on unlikely success, and sometimes success that required perseverance against odds or antagonism. From Spike’s talk about running a comic business when everyone told her that her background wasn’t good enough to do so, to Rami Ismail bemoaning the lack of time spent ensuring that the Arabic on buildings in games and media was accurate (after teaching us how to read Arabic in 10 minutes), we were taken on a journey of positive encouragement and shared joy. Other highlights were the You Look Nice Today podcast’s live recording, and the talks by Mallory Ortberg about death and running a successful website for queer librarians and female bodybuilders (I kid), and Amit Gupta’s talk about priorities and work.\nEverything Else The event was super well-planned and supported, and at any given time, there were a few activities possible, plus food and drinks. There were two longer daily breaks for dinner and lunch, and meeting and eating with new friends was strongly encouraged. The vetting process for attendees and the 1000 person limit ensured that almost anyone you chatted with was someone interesting. There were also many “lower-case f” famous people in attendance, such as John Gruber from Daring Fireball, Kathy Sierra, and Ashe Dryden.\nThe availability of tabletop games, as well as an Electric Objects art gallery, an arcade, and Instrument, and Panic’s parties kept folks moving through the city to great effect. I heard more than one person express newfound love for Portland, and my only hope is that they don’t move here and buy a house. (Confidential to some of you, please move here).\nIn Closing XOXO came off as a labor of love from the Andys, as well as a glorious way for those of us in tech, and adjacent, to learn new things about ourselves, and make positive connections to make the world just a little bit better. I feel incredibly lucky and happy to have attended, and I hope that next year I can return.\n","date":"September, 2015","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2015-09-14-xoxo/","tags":null,"title":"xoxo 2015"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A bit about this last few months.\nIt first hit me the night she left. The quiet. Before, there was rustling in the house, subtle signs of her presence, affection in the same space. Now, the night was too quiet, her form did not move with breath next to me. I was alone. My cats tried to fill the void. The wandered, and meowed, and looked for her in closets and cabinets — or so it seemed to me, as I projected my sadness onto them.\nWe were together for 6 years, and that never gets easier to say. We married. We are still, as of now, married. We are lesbians, but we didn’t start off looking like that. We both moved fast, without asking the questions that may have avoided the heartache. It’s hard to ask those questions when you’re having such a good time. When I looked at her, I saw someone that I could spend my days with — could grow old with — could sit in silence on a long journey with or excitedly discuss one of our new projects. This soured.\nNear the end, when I looked at her, I only saw pain. I was reminded of the anguish and agony of being unloved and unattractive. I didn’t know, I would say, what I did. But it was immaterial. There wasn’t one thing at all, rather, there were myriad difficulties and decisions and micro-agressions that led to our parting. I thought I would be willing to work on these problems, but she spared me the need. She just moved out… while I was on a video podcast. There was the briefest acknowledgement that this would be difficult, and then, as if she’d never been there, she was out of my house.\nShe said she’d never felt attraction for me, and that she probably had never been in love. It’s impossible for me to know if this is true, or just the result of years of cohabitation and the daily chore of partnership. I fear both the aloneness this made me feel, and the gaping maw of quiet and inner-dialogue that her leaving put me into. For me, I didn’t leave the partnership in time. My recovery will be a slow one.\nThe entire breakup happened at an incredibly inopportune time after a huge number of life changes were still settling. My relationships, even outside of that one, were in turmoil and freshness. I had experienced one of the most significant experiences through coming out as a lesbian, and as a trans woman, and many of my friends didn’t call so much afterwards. I found a new community, or at least other people I could relate to, through twitter. They were spread far and wide across American and Canada, and the flight miles I will rack up visiting them are immense. I don’t know if we are on twitter because we’re all alone together, or if our shared experiences and hurts are just too much to not have the 140 character pressure-release valve. Ultimately, I don’t like to question it too much. My friends are amazing now. I feel, finally, like a person that might be ok, someday.\nThe loneliness of a breakup is a special kind of bitterness. Nothing removes that taste, that tang of regret and sadness, except time. My apartment is filled with friends on occasion, but I still need someone to also call it home. It took months for me to be ok with the idea, but I am finding a roommate. Not a lover this time, or a girlfriend, but an actual roommate. This will be my first in seven years. This was also the first time I’ve lived alone. I hate it. I crave quiet and space at times, but in this void, I’ve sought nothing but noise and other living, breathing people. I want to crave quiet again. I want to argue over who does the dishes, and watch the worst shows on Netflix because we’re bored and lazy and maybe a little too drunk from brunch.\nThis quiet, this space, will be filled. My life will continue, and I will meet someone. I will meet someones awesome, possibly. We will talk and romance and date. Someday they will move in. I fear the cycle repeating, but it is a human cycle of death and rebirth. Of beginnings and endings. I am at a beginning.\n","date":"March, 2014","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2014-3-4-on-being-alone/","tags":null,"title":"on being alone"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The Future Most films that show our future are full of glitz and glamour, a fantastical land of flying vehicles. People live in clean, modern homes, and have their lives radically improved through technology, and want for nothing. Families and workers seamlessly keep in touch, and share parts of their lives with their friends and companions, and generally embrace the technology all around them.\nIf there is any enemy or ill feeling in the protagonist, it is usually an overlord or corporation that is taking over or slowly consuming their society. What Sci-fi films lack is the ennui-ridden, laconic hipster Luddite who eschews the tech of the day for practices hundreds of years old. And yet, this is the future we live in.\nThe Fetish For people like myself, the daily exposure to an always on connection can lead to dreaming of or even fetishizing disconnection. Tumblrs, Instagrams, and blogs all about country living, hand-made crafts, and wilderness exploration; where once we dreamed of hoverboards, HUDs, and instant content availability, we now dream of forests, shacks, and thick wool. In a very literal \u0026ldquo;grass is always greener\u0026rdquo; sense, many technologists and Internet workers I know dream of giving it all up for yurts, hikes, and leatherwork. Why fight with buzzing and demanding screens and sounds, when you can return to nature and regain a sense of humanity.\nThis attitude is parodied on Portlandia and Twitter, to humorous effect, but it really does exist. Men and women use old-fashioned tools to make cocktails with hand-chipped ice and eschew belts for suspenders.\nAnd in many ways, the realization that there is more to life than flashing lights and bandwidth is hugely progressive. More than ever our relationships and environment are fading into the background of a global connectedness, and some are finding ways to rebel and recover. But, much like a casual drinker who swears off alcohol, it’s easy to go too far in the other direction. Paul Miller from the Verge is an example, albeit an admittedly extreme one. In one Offline article, he goes so far as to speak of the impracticality of working and not using the internet. His experiment with internet disconnectedness is almost over, and from his more recent articles, it seems that he didn’t get much out of it. And really, unless you make leather goods by hand, and sell them at a market, you\u0026rsquo;re probably stuck on the web for some aspect of your life.\nA Possible Solution Really, going from always on to a Ted Kazynski cabin in the woods is a bad idea. It may seem exciting or sexy to become a lumberjack and live \u0026ldquo;off the grid\u0026rdquo;, but so many things about our modern conveniences are extremely helpful when used with discernment and moderation. The blind can see, the deaf can hear, and family thousands of miles away can speak to one another because of recent advances. These benefits should not be thrown out just because we have trouble putting our iPhones away during dinner. We should aim towards having Internet-free meals, or vacations, or weekends though. Learning the harder task of being offline sometimes, and not just joining a luddite cloister is a worthwhile discipline.\nStepping away from technology, much like putting aside work or a hard problem, can bring amazing perspective and appreciation for the marvels of our age. Instead of drastically changing our lifestyle, let’s strive to bring plain human interaction back into the life we already have.\nAnd while it may not sound as exciting as building our own house in the woods, and making our own butter as we groom our beard with a bone comb, it\u0026rsquo;s certainly a lot more achievable. We seem wired to desire drastic results and try extreme behavior to achieve them, but success in this regard is ephemeral. Minor tweaks to our behavior and routines won\u0026rsquo;t look as interesting, but will help keep us sane and able to enjoy technology as a tool.\nAs many have said, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t let the ideal be the enemy of the good\u0026rdquo;. Small changes to both our attitudes and actions can make huge improvements to our overall life quality.\n","date":"April, 2013","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2013-04-26-the-allure-of-the-minimal-and-disconnected/","tags":null,"title":"The Allure of the Minimal and Disconnected"},{"categories":null,"contents":" tv list years: 2018 2019\n2019   Tidying Up with Marie Kondo Chef \u0026amp; My Fridge Counterpart Doctor Who Into the Dark Dirk Gently Terror in Resonance The Gifted Ugly Delicious Boogiepop Phantom Dororo RerideD: Derrida who leaps through time My Roommate is a Cat Steven Universe Modern Family CANAAN Friends from College Ghost in the Shell SAC Steins; Gate 0 Brooklyn 99 Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Travellers Magicians The Grand Tour The Good Place Sex Education Continuum Dororo Skull-faced Bookseller Honda San Terrace House Patriot Act Russian Doll Umbrella Academy Top Gear Kyousougiga Dennou Coil Desus \u0026amp; Mero Hot Ones Pen15 King of the Hill Difficult People Gravity Falls Billions F1: Drive to Survive The OA Hanna Homecoming What We Do in the Shadows Barry Fleabag Kanata no Astra Arukawa Under the Bridge Carole \u0026amp; Tuesday Keiji Yugami Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans Succession The Team Mindhunger Shangri-la O Maidens in Your Savage Season Nichijou Dark Patriot Another Period Archer Flowers Great British Bake-off \u0026amp; Bake-Off Professionals Nathan for You Summer Camp Island Moominvalley True Blood  2018   Brooklyn 99 Terrace House: Next Door, New Doors, and Aloha State Dennou Coil Grand Tour Atelier Devil May Crybaby Good Place Magicians The Tunnel The Bridge Girl’s Last Tour Kemono Friends Kokkoku Darling in the Franxx Letterkenny Altered Carbon Counterpart B: The Beginning a place farther than the universe Veep Babylon Berlin Friends from College Chef \u0026amp; My Fridge Wild Wild Country Playground The Americans Adventure Time Bob’s Burgers Steven Universe Gravity Falls Killing Eve Atlanta Baskets The Rain Forbrydelsen The Dark Parts Unknown Worth It FLCL Making It Wrecked The League Burning Love Billions Sharp Objects Innocents The Chris Gethard Show Jack Ryan Hang-ups Midnight Sun Maniac Double-Decker Documental Zombieland Saga Origin Patriot Sabrina (Netflix) Svartsjön Travel Man King of the Hill Nightflyers Patriot Act Jordskott Runaways Bandersnatch  ","date":"January, 0001","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/tv/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"brook is a noted sapphist who lives in a forest with her cat snorri. she loves travel, food, and satan.\n","date":"January, 0001","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/about/","tags":null,"title":"about"},{"categories":null,"contents":" years: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n2020: 20 books Network Effect — Martha Wells\nIt’s nice to really stretch my legs in the Murderbot world. I hope Wells writes more novels in this fun universe, and we get to see Murderbot grow further past its general emotional discomfort.\nFinna — Nino Cipri\nA fun romp through an IKEA multiverse with a queer couple and a missing grandma. I had fun with this, and the short length meant I blazed through it almost too fast. I hope there’s more from Cipri soon.\nZero History — William Gibson\nI read this slowly to really savor it. The last book in the Blue Ant trilogy is the most oddball and fun, but always comes with the knowledge that I won’t get to adventure with Millgrim and Hollis again until I reread the series yet again in the future. It’s fascinating how thoroughly Gibson identified the coming brand drops, denim obsession, and obsession with quadrocopters. As a sage of the near future, he feels unparalleled.\nSpook Country — William Gibson\nA delightful reread of a really fun Gibson near-future/near-past adventure. There are so many moments in this book that make me super jealous I didn’t conceive of them. The Blue Ant trilogy owns bones.\nPolaris Rising — Jessie Mihalik\nA mix of space caper and Harlequin Romance, there was entirely too much straight sex in this for me. But, if you think “space operas should have more picking out dresses and rough hands on waists,” then this is the book for you.\nZero Sum Game — SL Huang\nAh a female protagonist who uses her math expertise to leap through windows and shoot bad guys! This book ruled. I’m not sure what this character’s “struggle” is going to be, because in the first book at least she’s a little invincible, but either way it was fun.\nThe Factory — Hiroko Oyamada\nA strange, short book with some challenging dialogue formatting. I really loved the small vignettes of slightly-slanted banal work life in The Factory. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to read more of Oyamada\u0026rsquo;s work, because despite reading quite a bit of Japanese fiction, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the chance to read very many Japanese women. I hope that I either get better at kanji to the point I can read from the source, or more translators translate other women.\nEmpress of Forever — Max Gladstone\nA fun space romp with a Jobsian lesbian protagonist and a strange cast of characters. This quickly shifts into a very different book from what it starts as, but I still loved it. More space lesbians, please.\nA Song for a New Day — Sarah Pinsker\nWelp, my second book for the month was another plague book, albeit one that largely took place in the aftermath of a pox. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, even if it was a little too hopeful for my usual taste. Honestly, it was a little refreshing to read a book where cool women make music and care about each other, and hope for the future. Thanks Haley for the tip on this one.\nWanderers — Chuck Wendig\nPhew, that was a dark fucking book. With the pandemic going on in the world right now, this wasn’t a very good idea to read, but I’m glad I finished it. Just about every bad thing you can imagine happens in this book, so I have a hard time recommending it, but perhaps for folks who don’t believe in global warming or in the danger of a pandemic, this will give them pause.\nLurking — Joanne McNeil\nA very interesting look at the history of the internet as a user. One of the best non-fiction books I’ve read in a while.\nThe Longing for Less — Kyle Chayka\nThis was far funnier than I expected, and also taught me a lot about a few areas of art and architecture I didn’t know about. A really informative and fun book.\nしろくまカフェ　1\n私のこれが最初日本語の漫画を読んだ。面白かったよ。次に谷崎の文学を読むww。\nOutline — Rachel Cusk\nThis was recommended to me, but I can’t say I loved it. The story here read more as a series of strange anecdotes, without a lot of core thread to grasp. There are two more books in this series, but I think I may pass on them.\nAgency — William Gibson\nA nearly present-day story of AI, art, and San Francisco. I really enjoyed this Peripheral sequel, though I think on the whole the fashion and strange web world of the previous trilogy was more my speed. I hope we get one more book with Netherton, Ash and company.\nMainline — Deborah Christiansen\nA fun throwback to the world of cyber decks and assassins. I wish I’d found this in 1996, but it holds up well. The plot got a little convoluted, but supposedly there’s a very recent sequel, so perhaps there will be payoff.\nUncanny Valley — Anna Weiner\nAh, the tech industry. I’ve been working in this world for over a decade and this book felt like a survey of it. I know a few people mentioned in the chapters, and am unfortunately very familiar with many of the events. I think Weiner did a great job of capturing the constant, weird feeling of trying to survive and often getting lost in the self-satisfied world of tech founders and “disruption”.\nThrone of Glass — Sarah J. Maas\nI was drawn to this book by the front cover and the vague notion that it might be like Gideon the Ninth. It’s not exactly super different, but it’s clearly YA, where Gideon is not. I may continue the series, as it was decently compelling, but I wish it were more genre and less youth.\nUnsubscribe — Jocelyn Glei\nAlthough this book is deep in the details of email, most of it applies just as well to Slack and other forms of messaging. I appreciate her approach to mindful work, as well as how she thinks about the problems of people and communication. A worthwhile read, especially if you struggle with a mountain of other people’s problems\nThe Walking Man — Jiro Taniguchi\nThe art in this manga is gorgeous. I especially love the way the leaves and grass are drawn. The stories are largely dialogue-less vignettes that meander through cities and the countryside, taking it all in. When I open this book, I wish I were in Japan again, following stray cats around town.\nEmily Eternal — M.G. Wheaton\nThis is an interesting take on apocalyptic fiction. With an AI protagonist and a dying sun, the story careens across the Americas and then even further. There’s a strange love story I didn’t care much for, but otherwise this was a nice romp.\n2019: 56 books Dept. of Speculation — Jenny Offill\nA gorgeous and sad book that captures long relationships so well. I loved for narrator and the strange poetic style of storytelling. I read this in two sittings and was enraptured.\nDead Astronauts — Jeff Vandermeer\nThis book did some interesting things with time, and some deeply annoying things with text. I feel like I know what he was doing with this book largely, and support his environmental aims (a+ murderous blue fox), but it never really came together for me.\nInterference — Sue Burke\nA fun follow-up to a great book from last year. I loved seeing how modern Earth folks mixed with the people on the rainbow bamboo planet. I was surprised to find that we only followed a single generation of characters this time, but I did enjoy how they were more fleshed-out.\nThis is How You Lose the Time War — Amal el-Mohtar and Max Gladstone\nA deeply strange time-travel romance between two competing spies, Blue and Red. The central conceit of shifting threads of history and letter-leaving was fun, but at times I honestly had no idea what was going on. I really enjoyed this book.\nThe Starless Sea — Erin Morgenstern\nI read this in a delightful haze during the holiday weekend. I love stories like these, that are also about stories, and books, and love. I remember liking the Night Circus, but I absolutely adore The Starless Sea. This is a book for those of us who love exploring, and digging into a fantastical tale.\nThe Infinite Wait — Julia Wertz\nMy friend Jenny recommended this one a while ago, and I finally got around to reading it. I couldn’t put it down. It’s hilarious, sad, and very close to home. I’d never heard of Wertz until now, but I plan to immediately buy all her comics.\nThe Future of Another Timeline — Annalee Newitz\nWow. This book was a triumph, and seriously seals Newitz as a scifi master. I only wish I could explore this world for longer. A perfect blend of history, speculation, and feminism—this book imagines a world in which collective action is possible deep into the past. Dang.\nHow to Do Nothing — Jenny Odell\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;ve finally finished her book, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the self-help palp that so many books about your phone are, but instead a wildly revelatory piece on bioregionalism, art, mystery, and birds. So many cool birds. This is a book I had to sip, because every few pages were full of so many ideas I wanted to savor them. I learned quite a bit from Jenny in these pages, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if it takes you a while to read this, just buy a copy and meander through California through it.\nShadow and Bone — Leigh Bardugo\nThis was a neat YA that ended far before I thought it would—my edition had almost 100 pages of previews after the book. I enjoyed the magic system, despite the unfortunate teen romance that tends to plague YA. I\u0026rsquo;ll likely read more of this series, in hopes that it continues to build a cool world.\nTo Be Taught, If Fortunate — Becky Chambers\nThis is one of the best sci-fi short novellas I’ve read in a while. It’s not quite hard SF, but I love all the little details. The characters are great, and just casually queer, and there’s just enough suspense to make it a real page-turner. A triumph.\nThe Guest Cat — Takashi Hiraide **\nDefinitely cried reading this one. I’m a sucker for Japanese cat literature for sure.\nRevenant Gun — Yoon Ha Lee\nThe final book in the Ninefox trilogy, and definitely the horniest one. If you military guys, there’s probably some fun for you in here. For me though, this was a great conclusion to a often confusing and wild series. I still don’t understand all of the math, but I love the world. There were some really interesting character choices here, and even though I wish we’d seen more of Cheris and Jedao chatting, the bits we did get were rad. This series was fantastic overall.\nPattern Recognition — William Gibson\nA reread of a favorite. I might or might not partially owe Cayce for a major style inspiration for my daily wardrobe. This story has a lot of artifacts of the early oughts, but most of it feels delightfully timeless.\nHollow Kingdom — Kira Jane Buxton **\nStill not sure how i feel about this book. I think the idea of the book was better than the execution.\nGideon the Ninth — Tamsyn Muir\nQueer space necromancers! Queer space necromancers! OMG. This book was utterly bizarre, and a hell of a lot of fun. I’m a fan of low-tech future space stories, where for the most part the book seems more like fantasy than sci-fi, so this book was a joy. Plus there was necromancy! Apparently there are going to be two more books in this series, which is a delightful thing to learn, because I want to stretch out and learn more about this strange universe.\nRaven Strategem — Yoon Ha Lee\nAll the world building and deciphering of the strange calendrical system paid off in full in this book. Getting a hint of what Jedao/Cheris might want at the end of Ninefox, this book deals with the aftermath of a dangerously peerless tactician let loose in the galaxy. I enjoyed all the strange details of the hexarchs, and imagining what each moth looked like. It’s been a minute since a sci-fi book got me so excited. This series can feel like a slog at first, but I think it’s worth it.\nNinefox Gambit — Yoon Ha Lee\nThis was one of the more challenging sci-fi books I\u0026rsquo;ve read in a while. Ultimately, figuring out what the hell was going on was well worth-it, but the first half or so was a frantic dog paddle to stay afloat. The world of NineFox Gambit is deeply strange, with technology that borders on magic that requires an empire to hold to a strict calendar for it to function. We follow a rad lady, with a homicidal general trapped in her head as she runs what seems like a suicide mission. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to read the rest of this series.\nMasterworks — Simon Jacobs\nLong form review\nThe Light Brigade — Kameron Hurley\nDefinite Catch-22 vibes throughout this book, with a hearty helping of Starship Troopers. If you like time-travel and space military, this is a solid read.\nThe Psychology of Time Travel — Kate Mascarenhas\nAh, time-travel and lesbians: two of my favorite things. This book was an interesting take on time-travel, and inevitable meeting of your future and past selves. I really enjoyed the small strange moments between characters.\nFrom the Fatherland with Love — Ryu Murakami\nOne of the more bonkers books that Ryu Murakami has written, it combines both his fascination with violence with a scathing satire on bureaucracy. I couldn’t put this down and found myself alternatively horrified and laughing.\nThe Book of Joan — Lydia Yuknavitch\nThis was a very strange, disjointed tale of a post-apocalyptic redemption narrative. I can’t say that I know a lot about Joan of Arc, but I trust that Yuknavitch drew from her history to write this. I can’t decide quite how I feel about this, but I will say that I found the author’s obsession with genitals and gender rather much. Does the author dislike trans people? Was she attempting to suggest that they are leading us to a dark, genderless place? This was unclear. There was a blurb that claimed this author is at the forefront of writing about gender fluidity, and I would say instead, she is mired deep in the past.\nMagic for Liars — Sarah Gailey **\nAh! I loved this book. What a brilliant marriage of noir and magic school. I devoured it in two sittings with a big grin on my face. Gailey is a delight, and after seeing them read the first chapter in person, I couldn’t wait to dive in. I hope they write more novels soon.\nRiver of Teeth — Sarah Gailey **\nWhat an absurd romp. This would’ve worked better for me if I enjoyed cowboys or the romance of men, but still it was fun enough. I don’t think I’ll read the next few books in this series, but I’m certain my friend in book club will devour them. Well-written and imagined, just not for me.\nDune — Frank Herbert\nA classic. I read this when I was a kid, but hadn’t reread it since then. It’s weird, long, and great. The rest of the series is supposed to be bizarre, so I can’t wait. The spice must flow.\nClaire DeWitt and the City of the Dead — Sara Gran\nAn alright mystery book, but more than a few times, I think the author attempted to add grit but just ended up sounding like a very awkward narrator. Also points off for a trans slur—like, c’mon, I don’t care who your narrator or, or how much of a fuck-up she is, leave us alone.\nParadise Rot — Jenny Hval\nA strange story of roommates, love, and interior mold. I hope Hval writes more strange books.\nThe Poppy War — R. F. Kuang\nThis book was brutal. Kuang transformed the rape of Nanking into a fantasy tale of gods, magic, and martial arts. The slow build of the martial arts academy quickly breaks down into the horrors of war. This is a grim book with even grimmer source material. This book was well-researched and skillfully written, and I will definitely continue on with Rin and the Cike into the sequel.\nThe Fated Sky — Mary Robinette Kowal\nMore cool space stuff! I enjoyed the pacing more in this book, and despite the frustration with very 50s attitudes that still pervade the modern world, I enjoyed journeying with these two books to mars.\nThe Bone Clocks — David Mitchell\nA delightful collision of strange characters across time. This book is just fantastical enough to scratch my sci-fi itch, and literary enough to keep me satisfied. I hadn’t read Michell in a while, but diving back in was like slipping on a well-fitting shoe. My only complaint is that I got a bit sick of “psycho-“ being applied to every magic thing, as it felt a bit too much like RPG spell naming, lol.\nAn Elderly Lady Is Up to No Good — Helene Tursten\nDelightfully wicked tales of a murderous octogenarian. I laughed, and cringed in turn. A short, strange read.\nThe Calculating Stars — Mary Robinette Kowal\nThis is an interesting alternate history where a disaster changes the fate of the planet, and accelerates the space race. Unfortunately, no disaster can change the rampant misogyny and racism of the men in power in this world. The protagonist, Dr. York, is a calculator, and dreams of being an astronaut, after years of flying planes as a WASP. I’m excited to read the sequel, but so many of the scenes of men being jerks to everyone else were pretty frustrating.\nExhalation: Stories — Ted Chiang\nChiang is one of the only authors I’ve read that truly puts the “speculative” into speculative fiction. Combining a curiosity about math, physics, and philosophy, Exhalation’s stories show a very adept storyteller playing with quite a few ideas. Each story is so different, and yet similarly great. I really hope Chiang writes a novel at some point, because I want to roam around his world’s for much longer.\nSourdough — Robin Sloan\nA fun book on getting into a new hobby, and getting out of tech. I’m not a baker, but I really liked how Robin described the baking process. There weren’t many characters with real depth, but our protagonist was fun.\nThe Book of M — Peng Shepherd\nAn interesting take on a plague/zombie-style post-apocalypse. I had trouble putting this book down, and the story kept me reading most of the day. I got to hear Shepherd read from her book at a literary event in the bay, and I’m very glad I did—this book ruled.\nNoumenon: Infinity — Marina J. Lostetter\nThis series ruled. There were pretty significant characters who were trans, or differently abled, and I feel like they were written pretty dang well. The space exploration and discovery plotlines split and re-intertwined many times, and always kept me fascinated. Definitely one of the most interesting sci-fi series I’ve read in years.\nNoumenon — Marina J. Lostetter\nAh! Another great multi-generational space exploration story. I don\u0026rsquo;t really get why so many sci-fi books are doing this sort of thing lately, but I\u0026rsquo;m into it. What happens when a ship heads into deep space to explore a distant star? This book. It rules.\nExit Strategy — Martha Wells\nA delightful end to this quadrilogy. I hope we get more Murderbot stories, but even if not, I\u0026rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed it.\nRogue Protocol — Martha Wells\nI’m really loving this series. Murderbot meets a new pal on this romp on a research station.\nHatching Twitter — Nick Bilton\nThis was a tour of betrayal, man-children, and absurd amounts of money. I’d love to see an Armando Ianucci adaptation of this book—especially the incredibly awkward visits with Zuckerberg. Well-written, and easy to read, this kept me very entertained on my flight.\nArtificial Condition — Martha Wells\nIt’s really nice to dive back into the series, and the MurderBot continues to be a funny narrator a distant space-bound future. I still think it’s a little odd that these were all published as novellas instead of a full-length, but the episodic quality does give me an easy place to pause and get more to drink. I hope we see more of the new ComfortBot.\nOnly Human — Sylvain Neuvel\nA solid conclusion to an excellent series. It’s too bad there’s not any more to read, but on the upside, it never dipped into uninteresting territory. The tone of this book is a little post-apocalyptic, and I’m a sucker for that kinda thing.\nWaking Gods — Sylvain Neuvel\nThis is a series that seems to amp up the excitement with each installation. The first book set the stage, and this is the play. There is quite a bit of action, and a lot of fallout from the first book. A great sequel.\nSleeping Giants — Sylvain Neuvel\nTold through a series of interview transcripts, de-briefings, and diary entries, this rad giant robot story managed to suck me in fast. I burned through this book in a couple of days, and loved every minute. I grew up on Robotech, so some of this plot felt familiar, except without all the singing. If you like giant robots, and somewhat mysterious non-governmental entities, this is a series to check out.\nThe Traveling Cat Chronicles — Hiro Arikawa\nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster. I should’ve be surprised, since it’s about a cat—one of the few things that makes me feel all of the emotions, but wow. This book was very, very good from start to finish. I picked it up on a whim, and it’s perhaps my favorite of the year.\nHow to Break Up With Your Phone — Catherine Price\nA pretty solid book on establishing more thoughtful ways of dealing with our devices. The advice to think about why you’re reaching for your phone when you do is extremely good, and deceptively simple. I’ve found myself trying to just be in a place without immediately flipping though phone screens to kill time, and maybe it’s helping? I’m going to keep on following the advice of this book for a while, and see how it helps or doesn’t. There’s good advice on email and other types of organization in here as well.\nKilling Commentadore — Haruki Murakami\nThis novel feels like a return to form, and yet also building on themes and ideas Murakami laid down in earlier books. His obsessions with pits, cats, WW2 history, jazz, and simple lunches are all here. I\u0026rsquo;m a little tired of the downtrodden male narrator, but despite being first-person, generally our painter guide moved the story along, interspersed with interesting observations. If you enjoy Murakami, there\u0026rsquo;s much joy here. I hope this author is with us for quite some time to come.\nThe United States of Japan — Peter Tieryas\nAn alternate history where Japan and Germany won WW2, then proceeded to divvy up North America. Most of the book is set in the 80s, in a world of internet devices, and giant robots, ruled by the Japanese emperor. It\u0026rsquo;s a brutal story at times, but was generally interesting and a good sci-fi time.\nIf Cats Disappeared from the World — Genki Kawarmura **\nI love a good devil’s bargain, and this book is full of them. This was a cute, sweet story about the real things we should value in life, and what we’re willing to sacrifice for life. The small details and strange obsessions reminded me a lot of Haruki Murakami’s style.\nThe City in the Middle of the Night ** — Charlie Jane Anders\nA fantastic book about humankind settling on a tidally-locked planet, but instead of seeing how we cope, we learn the stories of their descendants, hundreds of years after our first tentative steps. The light is too bright and hot, and the night too cold and dark. We live on the edge in an eternal dusk/morning light. The two protagonists, Mouth, and Sophie, are on the edges of society, yearning for things they\u0026rsquo;ve lost or can\u0026rsquo;t have, and all that leads towards. This book was a beautiful meditation on love and community, as well as memory. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read the Steerswoman series, you might find some familiarity, but generally the genre of lost technology and future worlds is incredibly fascinating to me.\nVengeful — VE Schwab\nAn interesting sequel to Vicious, the first of the Villains series. Most of the book serves as a prologue for the lighting-fast action at the end of the book, and I’m very excited to see what these characters do next, if she continues for a third installment. I really enjoyed the character June, because who doesn’t love a shapeshifting assassin?\nGenocidal Organ — Project Itoh\nA truly grim thriller about the cost of “fighting terrorism,” and the ability of language to tear apart a country. This feels eerily prescient. I can’t say I enjoyed reading this book, but it’s a nihilistic political commentary that at least adds some color to what politicians might be after when they start wars and conflicts. This book is graphic, violent, and in its way, poignant.\nAmberlough — Lara Elena Donnelly **\nIn some ways this reminded me of the show Babylon Berlin—it feels like an alternate reality 20s Germany, replete with spies, dancers, pasties, and patsies. I think it\u0026rsquo;s building up to a longer series, and so much of the plot slowly churned towards an ellipsis of an ending. I liked it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not rushing to read the next one. None of the characters necessarily captured my interest, but it was nice that the protagonists were largely gay. This book answers the question, what if folks wrote new stories with their own characters instead of fanfic.\nReclaiming Your Life from IBS — Melissa Hunt\nMy doctor recommended this, and it\u0026rsquo;s largely CBT 101 + some good notes on food and stress. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;ll be super useful, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see! I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if this is a problem I face, but the doctor said \u0026ldquo;probably\u0026rdquo;, so lol.\nThe Masked City — Genevieve Cogman\nAnother romp through alternate worlds with the rebellious librarian Irene, and her Sherlock stand-in pal Vale. The world of this book is largely a strange version of Venice, but more than the first book, other world’s tech is sprinkled throughout. I’m starting to doubt that we’ll get a high-tech book in this series, but I still hold out hope. The language is a little too powerful as a deus machina, but Cogman finds ways Irene can’t deploy it constantly, and still manages to provide a level of tension and excitement.\n9th Step Station — Malka Older \u0026amp; Co.\nThis read much like a series of Ghost in the Shell. From the NeoTokyo setting, to the ubiquitous cybernetic body mods, I expected Major Kusanagi to pop up at any juncture. That said, it also ruled. It’s been a long time since I read serialized fiction outside of comics, and the episodic nature made for a fun time. Each author added to the tale, instead of distracting with wild stylistic flourishes. I would happily read another series with Emma, Miyako, and the rest. There were less political machinations that I expected, based on other work from Older, but the story was fun, exciting, and well-told.\nInk and Bone — Rachel Caine\nA fun book about an alternate history library that is magical. This is very YA, but was enjoyable.\n2018: 47 books Semiosis — Sue Burke\nA late entry for one of my favorite books of the year. Dang. Lots of excellent bio-SF, along with intergenerational power struggles, and a fascinating way of telling a story. I am excited to see what happens in the second part of this book later this year, but for now, if you like xenobiology, post-apocalyptic fiction, or just interesting SF, read this.\nInvisible Library — Genevieve Cogman\nA bit steampunk, and a bit interdimensional Doctor Who. I liked this book enough to buy the next one in the series. It’s a fun romp with some promising world-building.\nNight Film — Marisa Pessl\nNight Film was generally an enjoyable book, but the multiple times Pessl uses trans people as a prop for \u0026ldquo;isn’t this a weird, twisted, gross thing?\u0026rdquo; are just boring and betray a fundamental lack of imagination. Trans people exist, and we sure as fuck read books. Grow up.\nProvenance — Ann Leckie\nA different planet and culture than the Raadchai from her trilogy, but a very compelling story. I got very confused for a while about who was who, but eventually I sorted it out.\nThe Dark Archive — Victoria Schwab **\nA fun, strange YA book about what happens after death, and the teens who defend the afterlife. There were some cool twists, and story details throughout, but the world building could have been better. Honestly every time I read one of these, I think, “wouldn’t this be better if it were gay?”, and reader, yes, yes it would. These sorts of books must really speak to teens though, because they portray adults as largely ineffectual idiots, who occasionally get in the way.\nCirce — Madeline Miller **\nThis book reminded me how much I remember of Greek myth and tragedy. I loved it. Circe is such an excellent protagonist, at the edges of society, ousted from gods and man alike. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read the Odyssey, this is a must read.\nRed Clocks — Leni Zumas\nA bit too close to our dystopian reality for my liking, but this was well-written, and full of strong and interesting women. I read this as I was leaving Oregon, and so a lot of it was a little bittersweet. This reads as a more realistic (sadly) handmaid\u0026rsquo;s tale.\nSympathy — Olivia Sudjic *\nWow, I loved this book. A story centered around sadness, obsession, and longing—for a family, for a lover, for a place. This was very well-written, and compelling, especially for a first effort. Some of the same Instagram ground is covered in this as is in Ingrid Goes West, but this felt more real. It\u0026rsquo;s also deeply, darkly hilarious, from the description of the awful tech boyfriend, to just how bad families can be for folks.\nInvasions — Calvin Gimpelevich\nMy review. TL;DR it was great. Buy it.\nLove \u0026amp; Estrogen — Samantha Allen\nI don\u0026rsquo;t usually read trans memoir—and I have a forthcoming piece that challenges and lampoons it to a degree—but Samantha is a friend and her story is close to my heart because of that. I had the chance to chat with her a lot through the course of part of this love and transition story, and I enjoyed the way she told it. This memoir definitely touched on some of the tropes of the genre, but by also being a wonderful love story, it manages to eschew many more.\nThe Tea Master \u0026amp; the Detective — Aliette de Bodard **\nThis was a fun detective tale with a mysterious Sherlock and a spaceship Watson. The setup never quite paid off with its mystery, but I look forward to reading more books in the series.\nState Tectonics \u0026ndash; Malka Older\nA fantastic conclusion to the Centenal Cycle Trilogy. I wish I could read a few more books from this universe, which I always figure is a great sign with any speculative fiction series. I keep recommending this trilogy to friends, both as an interesting political system, and as a gripping techno-political thriller with some truly rad female characters. I didn\u0026rsquo;t love every PoV character from State Tectonics as much as I did the previous two books, but that makes sense, as this book was about new beginnings, to a degree.\nConvenience Store Woman — Sayaka Murata **\nWow. This book was a lot more bizarre than I expected based on the recommendations I\u0026rsquo;d read—more Abe than H. Murakami. I loved the narrator, and the rich descriptions of convenience store life. This book was hilarious and wild. One of my favorites this year.\nWould You Rather — Katie Heaney\nA touching memoir of coming-out and learning that past dating disinterest was just latent sapphism, lol. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to love about this book, and also quite a bit of cringe. It\u0026rsquo;s a coming-of-age in a way, and overall I\u0026rsquo;d recommend it to young dykes and old, or anyone wondering if their sexuality is \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo;.\nWorth the Wait — Karelia Stetz-Waters *\nThis was a corny AF lesbian romance. Lots of random sex, and a main plot of \u0026ldquo;the cute femme can\u0026rsquo;t come out bc reasons\u0026rdquo;. Nothing groundbreaking, but it was an easy read.\nRecord of a Spaceborn Few — Becky Chambers\nThis was a much slower-paced book than the previous two, and was largely a slice of life about Exodans—the humans who left Earth to take their chances in the universe after Earth became uninhabitable. I enjoyed the various characters, the queer relationships, and the color added to this way of life. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have a space scifi book that isn\u0026rsquo;t full of lasers and danger.\nFingersmith — Sarah Waters *\nIn an odd turn of fate, I\u0026rsquo;d seen the Handmaiden before I read this book, so the English setting was strange compared to the eerie world of Korean director Park Chan-Wook. I knew most of the twists because of the film, but Waters has a deft way with descriptions, and Maud and Sue came alive on the page. It felt like I was reading this for weeks, but that\u0026rsquo;s likely because I devoted little time to reading. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I finished this, and recommend it if you love multi-layered, deftly-woven stories.\nEmpire Ascendant — Kameron Hurley\nA wild second installment in the Mirror Empire trilogy that is so chock-full of characters and their (spoiler alert) doubles, that I got a bit confused. There\u0026rsquo;s a glossary and character list in the back, but dang, this is some GoT stuff. I enjoyed the descent into chaos in this book, and I\u0026rsquo;m eagerly anticipating the conclusion(?) in the third. Also one of the only books I know that has a character using ze/hir pronouns, but it also unhelpfully talks about sex as different from and perhaps less malleable than gender, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call this a \u0026ldquo;dope representation of trans folks,\u0026rdquo; so much as \u0026ldquo;well there\u0026rsquo;s some genderqueerness I guess\u0026rdquo;.\nAdventure Zone: There Be Gerblins\nA masterful adaptation of the podcast D\u0026amp;D romp into a graphic novel. I absolutely loved this. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this would be as fun if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t listened to the podcast, but if you haven\u0026rsquo;t, get on it\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s free and it\u0026rsquo;s delightful.\nLa Bastarda — Trifonia Melibea Obono *\nA lesbian novel from Equatorial Guinea that tells a short story of a woman abandoned by her father, and orphaned by her mother who finds herself falling for another woman. The first half was full of build-up and world-building, but the back half felt like a very rushed piece, as though Trifonia was hoping to get it all out in a final effort. I enjoyed this book, but the bits that were glossed over about Okomo\u0026rsquo;s journeys, her grandfather\u0026rsquo;s death, and other scenes could\u0026rsquo;ve been fleshed-out.\nBlackfish City — Sam J. Miller **\nThis book ruled, and I was super surprised at how much I loved it. Absolutely riveting, and a blast. The individual characters felt very distict, and were easy to follow, and the world felt really interesting.\nInfidel — Kameron Hurley\nReally loving this series about a tough AF bounty hunter lady named Nyx. The world-building is pretty interesting, and the story moves forward at a pretty good clip. All-told, this is a fun sci-fi action novel.\nPaprika — Yasutaka Tsutsui\nA fantasticly bizarre story of science, dreams, desire, and the smallness of men. I\u0026rsquo;d seen the anime adapted from this book years ago, so I had some predisposition towards envisioning characters a certain way, but this book goes to way different places than I remember the movie going. I liked this quite a bit, save for the weird shit with sexual assault. Like many books written by a guy, it shows.\nLittle Fish — Casey Plett\nOutstanding and devastating. This is a book full of people I\u0026rsquo;ve known, slept with, and smiled at across the room. Family is a tenuous thing, and Little Fish finds space for it throughout. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I would\u0026rsquo;ve made with this years ago, but now, it\u0026rsquo;s a sad and good ache. I hope Casey keeps writing, and sharing her work with us for years to come. I read this in one go, and it was a wild ride that had me laughing and crying.\nSwearing Off Stars — Danielle Wong *\nStarted off alright, but quickly telegraphed to an all-to-common \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t really be with you until it\u0026rsquo;s too late\u0026rdquo; lesbian novel. I also kept thinking an editor had asked her to just add tons of adjectives, willy-nilly. It was an odd read, and the time-jumps didn\u0026rsquo;t help. If you can write a lesbian romance in 2017, why would you lean so hard on tropes of one woman dying? Super annoying. It was a pretty quick read at least. Read for a lesbian book club.\nGods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach — Kelly Robson **\nA cool scifi short novel where the future is barren, but at least there\u0026rsquo;s time-travel. I wanted more world-building, and probably a couple more books in this story, but that also means I liked this book quite a bit. The back half of the book felt much faster than the lead-up, and much of the action was compacted, but it was a fun adventure. This is a solid addition to the burgeoning eco-scifi genre.\nGold, Fame, Citris — Claire Vaye Watkins\nInteresting book about a post-apocolyptic wasteland America and the ideas of survival and family. I enjoyed this.\nSpace Opera — Catherynne M. Valente **\nUproriously fun, and silly throughout. Take Douglas Adams, add in some queerness, and an obsession with Eurovision. Loved this from start to finish. I devoured the backhalf of this book in one sitting at a cafe in Copenhagen, and found myself crying in the afterword/credits.\nCaszandra — Andrea Höst\nUgh, I wanted to enjoy the rest of this story, but this book was so exceedingly dull. I loathe that the main character was setup to not only get married, but have kids at ~19 years old. Fuck that. This series started off well, but ended up being even worse than Twilight. Read the first book, and skip the rest.\nLab Rat One — Andrea Höst\nOk, this series is exceedingly straight, and that\u0026rsquo;s a bummer. I wish there was a lot less pining after the sad boy, but the magic and tech continues to be interesting. The pacing is a little lax, and I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten slightly sick of the cycles of \u0026ldquo;power then injury\u0026rdquo; that Cass goes through, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to finish this out.\nStray — Andrea Höst\nThis was recommended to me by my buddy Nick, and I\u0026rsquo;d avoided it for unknown reasons. Maybe the cover was too low-budget? But, this book is really fun. I think this series kinda qualifies as YA, but the journal nature, as well as the mystery of scifi tech/magic systems got me deep into the world. A really nice vacation read.\nAll Systems Red — Martha Wells\nPretty fun book about a \u0026ldquo;murderbot\u0026rdquo; who would rather be watching tv dramas than shooting anything. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the next few books.\nThings to Do When You\u0026rsquo;re Goth in the Country — Chavisa Woods **\nA truly excellent short-story collection that pairs well with some of the stories in Her Body and Other Stories. This book reminded me of growing up southern baptist in Texas, after September 11th. Really beautiflly written, and quite melancholy.\nA Wrinkle in Time — Madeline L\u0026rsquo;lengle**\nThis was a re-read, but I loved diving through it again.\nThe End of My Career — Martha Grover\nHilarious, sad, and real; the End of My Career is a very intimate look at life in Portland as a chronically ill woman with history and a sense of humor. I loved this. I wish it were gayer, but I wish everything were gayer, so. As a more recent Portlander, the pain, and amusement she talks about watching her city change is similar to how I felt about my home of Austin.\nSoulless — Gail Corrigan **\nWow, I hated this. I started reading it with a wry grin, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t ever decide if it meant to be as insipid as it was. I never want to read about how hot a wereman is again. I never want to read about umbrellas, or petticoats.\nAcceptance — Jeff Vandermeer\nThe final book in the Southern Reach trilogy ties everything together, and provides a lot of backstory and history. There\u0026rsquo;s so much that\u0026rsquo;s desperately sad in this book, and I love it.\nAuthority — Jeff Vandermeer\nI loved this second book both times I read it, because so much of it is a slow creep of bueracracy and questions. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t anyone giving Control a straight answer? What\u0026rsquo;s with Ghost Bird? Ugh, this series is fantastic.\nAnnihilation — Jeff Vandermeer\nThis is a re-read, because right after seeing the movie based on this book, I wanted to dive back into Area X. To me, this series still captures all the best parts of Vandermeer\u0026rsquo;s wierdness in a cohesive way. If Borne was oddly funny, this book is just odd, and City of Saints \u0026amp; Madmen is, perhaps, homicidal. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure if there are many hidden things in this book, but I also haven\u0026rsquo;t looked too deep, bc City of Saints \u0026amp; Madmen sucked me in in a way I found frightenting.\nGoodbye, Things — Fumio Sasaki\nWhat an odd book full of short, declarative sentences. Some bits of this were great, but a lot of it was about what you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a Medium article. The bit about the owl statues was golden.\nThe Language of Power — Rosemary Kirstein\nA great fourth book in a series I\u0026rsquo;ve really loved. This book furthers the \u0026ldquo;what the fuck are the wizards, and what\u0026rsquo;re they doing\u0026rdquo; plotline. A lot of suspicions from the past few books have led me here. There\u0026rsquo;s some really neat stuff left to figure out, so I hope that in a few years we\u0026rsquo;ll have book 5 \u0026amp; 6.\nGirls on Fire — Robin Wasserman\nFantastic coming-of-age book. I really loved all the grunge, and surrepitious drinking, and peer-pressure.\nBinti: Night Masquerade — Nnedi Okafor\nThe trilogy comes to an ok conclusion. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t my favorite Binti (the first one has that handily covered). Additionally, the pacing was wacky. There was a lot of time spent building up to a conflict that doesn\u0026rsquo;t go very far, then an unsatisfying conclusion. The main character ends up having so much thrown at her with little-to-no consequence, that the whole thing gets to a comic level of ridiculousness.\nNull States — Malka Older\nA nice sequel to Infomocracy that explored some new characters while still letting Mishma and Ken run around a bit. Much of this book was a build-up that never seemed to deliver, but it feels like the story will come to a head a bit more in the potential next book.\nInfomocracy — Malka Older\nThis techno political thriller ruled. This story created the kind of world I want to dig around in for some time to come, so I\u0026rsquo;m glad there\u0026rsquo;s at least one more.\nAutonomous — Annalee Newitz **\nDrug piracy, copyright, and queerness. I really loved this story, save for the happy ending for the cops.\nOn Such a Full Sea — Chang-Rae Lee\nReally enjoyed this futuristic look at America and the fall of our current system. Lots of discussion of class, immigration, and identity. The narrator was a little distracting, but it was an interesting narrative conceit.\n2017: 70 books Reacquainted with Life — Kokumo\nThe Kingdom of Gods — NK Jemison\nSlice Harvester — Colin Atrophy Hagendorf\nThe Inheritance Trilogy — NK Jemison\nThe Remedy — Zena Sherman\nTexts from Jane Eyre — Mallory Ortberg\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t understand half of this, because Mallory \u0026amp; I have divergent tastes, but she gave me a European paperback, so I read it finally after it being sold out in a bunch of places. Love her.\nFreedom is a Constant Struggle — Angela Davis **\nThis was a coven book club book. It was lovely, but also super repetitive, because most of the talks/essays were written/given around the same time, so the themes \u0026amp; topics are the same. Important, but I probably didn\u0026rsquo;t need to read them all.\nThe Small Backs of Children — Lydia Yuknavitch\nObjects in Mirror are Closer\u0026hellip; — Kate Carroll deGates *\nMagician King — Lev Grossman\nMagician\u0026rsquo;s Land — Lev Grossman\n100 Crushes — Elisha Lim\nWet Moon Vol. 1 — Sophie Campbell\nThe Mirror Empire: Worldbreaker Saga 1 — Kameron Hurley\nFire — Elizabeth Hand\nHome — Nnedi Okafor **\nA Conjuring of Light — VE Schwab\nWomen\u0026rsquo;s Barracks - Tereska Torres *\nTheresa + Isabelle — Violette LeDuc *\nFor Your Own Good — Leah Horlick\nDifficult Women — Roxanne Gay\nExit West — Moisin Hamid **\nAnother book club book. This was a really neat exploration of immigration, family, and place. I super loved this book.\nSex Object — Jessica Valenti\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet — Becky Chambers **\nA Herstory of Transmasculine Identities — Michael Eric Brown\nLiterally Show Me a Healthy Person — Darcie Wilder\nSaga Vol. 7 — Fiona Staples\nA Closed and Common Orbit — Becky Chambers\nThe Border of Paradise — Esme Wang **\nI\u0026rsquo;m in Friend Love with You — Yumi Sakugawa\nBorne — Jeff Vandemeer\nWhere the Words End \u0026amp; My Body Begins — Amber Dawn\nBecause They Wanted to: Stories — Mary Gaitskill\nPony Castle — Sofia Banzhaf\nThe Slow Fix — Ivan Coyote\nx-23 Collection — Marjorie Liu\nAPOSIMZ 1-4 — Nihei Tsutomu\nMurcielago Vol.1 — Yoshinarakana\nMoshi Moshi — Banana Yoshimoto\nThe Wicked \u0026amp; Divine — Kieron Gillen\nThe Orange Eats Creeps — Grace Krilanovich\nNine Cuts — Audrey Chin\nMonstress Vol.2: The Blood — Marjorie Liu\nMurcielago Vol.2 — Yoshinarakana\nMotor Crush Vol.1 — Babs Tarr\nI\u0026rsquo;m really stoked on this queer lady motorcycle racing comic. Like, damn. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for the next one. The art is fantastic, and the story is a little light, but hints at a lot more. The world seems interesting. Why do the motorcycles get addicted?\nThe Idiot — Elif Batuman\nMy Lesbian Experience with Loneliness — Kabi Nagata\nHard Boiled \u0026amp; Hard Luck — Banana Yoshimoto\nA nice slice-of life, that\u0026rsquo;s sad in a way that is very refreshing in the summer. These books are about losses, and how to cope and move forward. I\u0026rsquo;m really enjoying rediscovering Banana Yoshimoto\u0026rsquo;s writing.\nBittersweet — Nevada Barr *\nAn easy-enough read, but the story was too \u0026ldquo;femme danger \u0026amp; butch power\u0026rdquo; for me. The \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo; story takes place between a late-20s/early-30s woman and a teenager (gross), and at a certain point they basically agree that if a man tries to marry Sarah, she\u0026rsquo;ll just go along — bc obviously femme women are just waiting for a man, and butches have to fight those men off bc we have no agency. I dunno. This author is also, AFAIK straight\u0026hellip; which is doubly strange. Weird shit happens in this, and maybe it\u0026rsquo;s worth reading if you\u0026rsquo;re super into the 19th century \u0026ldquo;west,\u0026rdquo; but the adult on teen predatory love and the bullshit masc \u0026gt; femme stuff is really not my bag.\nZodiac Starforce: By the Power of Astra — Kevin Panetta\nCute sailor-moon-style girl team of fighters. Really enjoyed how this was drawn, and the queerness of a few of the characters. If you need something lighthearted, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a read.\nGeneration Loss — Elizabeth Hand\nI\u0026rsquo;d only read Fire, a short story collection by Hand, before and wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to expect. It was exciting expecting this to be odd literary fiction, then discovering it\u0026rsquo;s a moody mystery. Definitely fun, and odd, and great.\nWitches, Sluts, Feminists — Kristen J. Sollee **\nThis was a decent non-fiction exploration of witches \u0026amp; to a degree, sluts \u0026amp; feminists through the ages. It focuses primarily on the Americas, and despite my usual disinterest in non-fiction this was fun and informative enough to carry me through on a camping trip during the eclipse. Time to find some DMT for my flying broom.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s War — Kameron Hurley **\nQueer bounty hunters, devout magicians, and so much sand intermingled in this fun ride through a Islam-based religion colonized planet where organs are bought and sold, and a war between two countries rages on pointlessly. I wanted to stay in this world for longer, as new wrinkles kept being added. Luckily, there\u0026rsquo;s a sequel.\nThe Stone Sky — NK Jemison\nWow, this was a fantastic ending to a delightful trilogy. Loved this story of family, world-rending powers, and ecology. Seriously one of the best things I\u0026rsquo;ve read in years, in fantasy or literature.\nThe Merry Spinster — Mallory Ortberg\nReview on Medium\nNotes from a Crocodile — Qiu Miaojin **\nThis book was such a lovely combination of melancholy feelings, and slightly obsessive lesbian love. I loved all of the Abe references.\nFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe — Fannie Flagg *\nThis was very much like a long conversation with an old woman in the south, like say, a grandma. I had a great time reading this, but there was a long, slow burn until I was crying, from my intitial \u0026ldquo;meh, this is ok.\u0026rdquo;\nPaper Girls: Vol. 3 — Brian K Vaughn\nI still have no idea where this is going, but so far it\u0026rsquo;s still a fun ride.\nBitch Planet: Vol. 2 — Kelly Sue DeConnick\nTrans women were paid to consult on this volume, and it shows. I\u0026rsquo;m super curious to see where the women on thr prison planet wind up. The art in this isn\u0026rsquo;t my favorite, but it seems well-written at least.\nInk \u0026amp; Bone — Rachel Caine\nThis is the first in a series I\u0026rsquo;ll probably read the rest of. It was a cute and occasionally brutal story about the flow of information, and what might have occurred if the library of Alexandria had become a world-controlling organization. There\u0026rsquo;s a YA/Harry Potter vibe to the whole thing.\nAsh — Malinda Lo *\nRetelling and retooling the Cinderalla tale into a lesbian romance, Ash is a pretty fun read. I blazed through this quickly, and am curious to read more from Lo. Compared to most books we read for Lesbian Book Club, this was a very light, but we-written book, and that\u0026rsquo;s a nice respite. I\u0026rsquo;m always here for books where the protagonist falls in love with a huntress.\nThe Witch\u0026rsquo;s Daughter — Paula Brackston ***\nA fun tale told in the present and past of a witch on the run, and her new apprentice. This book drew me in and kept me awake late so I could find out what happened next. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to read the second one. A definite improvement over the first book for this club, which I quit part-way through.\nThe Witches of New York — Ami McKay **\nThis book was great. I read a lot of witch books this month, but this was by far my favorite. It captured the New York or yore well, and delightfully set up for a few more stories about these women and their tea and sympathy shop. The magic in this book was better fleshed-out than The Witch\u0026rsquo;s Daughter, and I enjoyed the church being the enemy, though demons vs. witches was an odd choice.\nThe Little Book of Hygge — Meik Wiking\nBroke my rule about reading white guys to read this random book about Hygge. TBH I thought the author was a woman for most of the book. Oh well. This is a book all about candles, coziness, and of course, hygge. Turn the lights down low, light some tallow, and drink some gløgg this winter to make even a Copenhagen/Portland winter happy. I was happy to find that I\u0026rsquo;m already living a hella hygge life, but got some further tips on hyggeligt.\nRose of No Man\u0026rsquo;s Land — Michelle Tea\nThis is a lesser-known Tea book, but also one of her few true fiction books. This was kinda cute, and definitely an intense slice of life of a young maybe lesbian near Boston, complete with mall life, and scoring drugs and alcohol. It\u0026rsquo;s a short book, but I really liked it.\nOranges Are Not the Only Fruit — Jeaneatte Winterson\nThis was a re-read, but dang. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to read the more real-life version of her story Why Be Happy When You Can Be Normal soon. Growing up in a religious home, albeit a fortunately less zealous one as a queer woman this book meant a lot.\nHer Body and Other Parties — Carmen Maria Machado\nWow. This short-story collection knocked me back with the depth and power of its often odd stories. The midsection of the book satirically and diabolically explores a popular network crime drama, and reading it I immediately went from \u0026ldquo;what the hell?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;omg I love this\u0026rdquo;. I am thrumming with anticipation of more work from Machado. This is probably the best thing I\u0026rsquo;ve read this year.\nAre You My Mother? — Alison Bechdel\nA messy tangle of a book and metabook about a mother and therapy. I liked this, but it\u0026rsquo;s coming from such a strange distant place I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to immediately connect to it in the way I did with Fun Home. I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep thinking about this one.\nBasic Witches — Jaya Saxena \u0026amp; Jess Zimmerman **\nA series of spells, and a lot of nice discussion of how to care for oneself with witchcraft, presence of mind, and good friends. I liked this a lot, but it was fairly, well, basic. This would be a great introduction to give to a younger person.\nCaraval — Stephanie Garber\nSome light-hearted YA to close out the year. This was a well-told, if sometimes upsetting story. A lot of this had me wondering: straight people, are you ok?\n2016: 58 books The Broken Kingdom — NK Jemison\nThe Laugh of the Medusa — Helene Cixous\nFun Home — Allison Bechdel\nUnder the Udala Trees — Chinelo Okaparanta\nFair Play — Tove Jansson\nBinti — Nnedi Okafor\nThe Language of Power — Rosemary Kirstein\nFantasian — Larissa Pham\nThe Dispossessed — Ursula K Le Guin\nWhen the Sick Rule the World — Dodie Bellamy\nYear of the Monsoon — Caren J.

I certainly didn’t! This is the second movie I’ve watched because of the podcast The Scaredy Cats wherein one host of Reply All tries to help the other host inure himself to horror films. With all of the cultural cachet this movie had, it was interesting to see how quickly they showed Freddy himself. Freddy also seemed shorter than I imagined. I also always find it funny when all the “high school” actors are in their twenties. Why not just set it in college?\nUpgrade\nAn interesting take on the post-human world. It’s a schlocky, funny, gory AF film, and not very into its own violence. Also it was rad to see Betty Gabriel from Get Out again.\nSonic the Hedgehog\nWeird how much more low-key enjoyable this was than the last movie I watched. From the delightfully bad puns, to Jim Carrey having way too much fun, to Ben Schwartz just being himself, this was a nice Saturday afternoon romp. I went in expecting basically nothing, and was pleasantly surprised.\nThe Dead Don’t Die\nThis movie so badly wanted to be clever, it is the film equivalent to wearing a “funny shirt” from Hot Topic and explaining the joke to everyone before they can even laugh.\nThe Lodge\nOne of the better horror films I’ve seen in a while, with a very scary house, and an excellent secluded location.\nSaturday Night\nA fun documentary with rather overwrought camera-work that shows what preparing for and shooting SNL is like. It’s kinda wild to see the sheer number of writers and staff that make it come alive.\nThe Exorcist\nPretty creepy, with great special effects considering the time. I always root for the demons in any one of these, and definitely wondered while watching this how many more kids priests hurt than these imagined evil spirits. The devil, it turns out, was the church all along.\nVivarium\nStarted creepy, got way creepier. I appreciate the unwillingness to tell the viewer what the fuck is happening. This plays out like a great Ursula K Le Guin novel.\nAfter the Storm\nKoreeda is one of the best directors when it comes to presenting the sadly funny banality of life. I can’t fathom someone else who could present a deadbeat dad and dysfunctional family with such pathos. This isn’t quite as heartrending as Shoplifters, but it comes close.\nGame Night\nJust a good time. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and it hopped along at a good clip while keeping me laughing.\nHustlers\nI love a good grift. I’m still low-key mad this wasn’t about a lesbian romance between J Lo and Constance Wu though. The Commuter\nA perfectly serviceable train thriller. Pretty fun.\nJumanji: Next Level\nHave you ever wanted to see the Rock play Dan Devito? What about Jack Black playing a younger black guy? This movie was more bizarre than the last but hey, it was also fun.\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\nThe extras’ costuming in this film is deeply strange, with a mix of “Indiana Jones pan-middle-east” and “Mad Max”. This whole film was a glorious mess, and I loved it.\nThe Guest\nThis was surprisingly funny and very bizarre. I really enjoy Dan Stevens, ever since his turn as Xavier’s son Legion.\nPrisoners\nIn preparation for the eventual release of the new Dune film I wanted to familiarize myself with Villneuve’s ourve. This is a very good mystery film with a grittier Gyllenhal than his turn at Zodiac.\nRythym Section\nA training montage revenge flick that slowly transforms into a pretty thrilling action movie.\nBloodshot\n“I don’t mind the scars, I just don’t like the stories they tell.” With a time-to-tanktop of just under 5 minutes, you know from the jump this will be a new Diesel vehicle. This movie had it all: underwater tai-chi, weightlifting, Guy Pierce, and a drinking competition to hone in on Vin’s favorite shot. Of course, as a Chinese-financed movie, there’s no blood or sex or skeletons. Also why didn’t they put that one guy’s eyes in his head instead of on his chest?!\nRadius\nInteresting conceptually, but it didn’t really go anywhere besides the concept. It would’ve been better as an anime, lol.\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\nWell, fuck. That was gorgeous and sad. This movie built until my heart ached, and wove a story of falling in love.\nCrawl\nIt’s no Underwater, but I guess if you want to see a great reason not to visit Florida, this is a perfect anti-ad.\nUnderwater\nThis turned out was cooler that i was expecting. Can’t say much more without spoiling anything.\nGeneral Magic\nAfter seeing the fictionalized versions of many of these folks in Steve Jobs, and hearing so many stories about others—some of whom I’ve met—this was a really interesting look at a company that catalyzed much of what we use every day to live online.\nSteve Jobs\nOh, hey, it’s Shiv! It’s kind of fascinating that the entire story is told through the lead-up to the presentations that implanted Steve Jobs in so many of our brains. I really enjoyed seeing this, and also think it’s funny this came out only 2 years after the Kutcher film. Also, Fassbender has a way cooler vibe that the actual Jobs\u0026hellip; I mean, he’s Magneto!\nThe Social Network\nOne of the wildest things about this movie is the that Facebook’s valuation at the time of the credits rolling was only $25 billion. A few years later, it’s nearly 500 billion. I left Facebook 3 years before this film came out, and briefly returned while in Portland. I get the sense the characters in the film might be less likable in real life.\nApollo 13\nSuch a fantastic film. It’s surprising how well this held up, with many practical effects and no terrible CGI. It’s been 25 years and this one still had me on the edge of my seat.\nOverlord\nThis felt a bit like a video game. Lots of nazis getting blown up? Weird underground lab? Strange NPCs? Check.\nBirds of Prey\nIt’s a low bar, but this is definitely the best DCU movie since all the serious Nolan Batman films. Not only was it silly fun, it managed to build interesting characters and solid battles that put the overwrought CGI-fest of Avengers to shame. I hope if they make more of these they keep the formula. I really want to see a love story between Poison Ivy and Harley.\n1917\nA very intense movie but it was also beautiful in its own way. I get why this won awards. Weird cameo by Doctor Strange though.\nThe Martian\nAnother rewatch. I had a FaceTime call where my friend Lena and I discussed Halt and Catch Fire, which reminded me how much I enjoyed this film, which I took to be about the competence of McKenzie Davis’ character. This was my first time watching this movie in 4K though, which made it look pretty amazing. Also, I always forget Donald Glover was in this.\nSkyfall\nPerhaps one of the only movies to use a Land Rover Defender in a car chase, this is pure fun. The filming and action scenes were a wild step-up from the previous two films, and the stakes felt high throughout.\nQuantum of Solace\nFar less memorable than Casino Royale. The first chase was fun, but a lot of the rest of the film kinda just meanders. I do appreciate the little nods towards older James Bond films though.\nCasino Royale\nRewatching this in preparation for the eventual release of the final Daniel Craig bond film. It holds pretty well, save for the hilariously old-looking Sony phones and bootcut khakis. I’d forgotten Mads Mikkelsen was in this.\nContagion\nI saw this in the theater when it first came out, but I haven’t seen it since then. This felt like a timely movie considering our current circumstances. I forgot Jude Law plays a weird crank reporter.\nJojo Rabbit\nA deeply strange film about learning how to be a person and unlearn fanaticism. There were some pretty excellent cameos in this, and a very dark comedic beat.\nPhantom Thread\nWow, this movie was hilarious from top to bottom. A friend (hi Drew) invited me to see it for the first time in 70mm, and all I want to do is channel Woodcock every day. \u0026ldquo;What am I supposed to do with that?\u0026rdquo;. What a joy. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to watch this again.\nFirst Love\nA strange mistaken gangster film. This was much more straightforward than many Takeshi Miike films, but still managed to add in some really bizarre bits, and even some surprises.\nElle\nYow. That was\u0026hellip; a lot of movie. Isabelle Huppert was fantastic, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I could recommend it. Definitely one of the stranger Verhoeven movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen.\nAnna\nAnother lady assassin movie. It was a helluva ride and I enjoyed it. I don’t think it added anything huge to the genre, but I’m just glad to have more cool movies about tough women. That said, I wish Anna had been able to just be with her girlfriend instead of randomly fucking spymasters.\nGennocidal Organ\nI read the book this movie is based on last year, and it’s a truly brutal story of linguistics and massive unrest. This movie is grim in a way that feels a little too prescient. Definitely one of the better anime thrillers I’ve seen in a while though.\nPsycho Pass Movie Trilogy\nAfter season 3, Psycho Pass had a trilogy of films in Japan. They’re fun continuations of the characters from all three seasons, and a bit of a sequel to the first movie. The future this film presents is pretty grim, but the animation is fantastic.\nWeathering With You\nI found out I don’t need to worry about climate change because it’s just rain, ya know? This film was gorgeous and fun and o loved the cat in it with my entire heart.\nMatrix: Reloaded\nReally starting the year off right. We talked through most of the exposition, which was like 75% of the movie. I hadn’t seen this since it came out, and it really didn’t hold up.\nThe Lighthouse\nThe first thing I noticed in this film was the tight, constrained feel of a square frame with deep black and white images. I immediately had to look around for how this was made. The VVitch is one of my favorite movies of all time, and Eggers doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint in this haunting film either. The dread builds as the antipathy between the two men grows. A joy.\n2019 74 Movies Ford vs. Ferrari\nA blast! I love car racing so much, and this film was a gorgeous vision of a famous showdown between an incredible car company, and Ford. I grew up hearing stories about Shelby, and this film brought him to life.\nUncut Gems\nThis was wild! From front to back this movie was a rollercoaster of poor decision-making and the world of vigs, 3 way parlay, and Kevin Garnet. Adam Sandler showed that he could really act in Punch Drunk Love, and he absolutely owns in Uncut Gems.\nOne Cut of the Dead\nWithout spoiling it, all I’ll say is this film went to fun places I didn’t expect, and was a delight throughout.\nPsycho Pass\nThe episodes of this show already feel fairly cinematic, so stretching the show to nearly 2 hours felt right. It was super jarring to hear random English throughout the film though—at the start I thought I was accidentally watching a dub.\nStar Wars: Rise of Skywalker\nFrankly this post from Film Critic Hulk covered my feelings well. I described it as a movie trying to fellate itself. Scenes rarely got to breathe, and the movie felt packed with fan service and confusing backtracking from Last Jedi. Also wow, they just dropped a bunch of character storylines.\nAd Astra\nSpace Brad Pitt! We’ve sent most leading men to space, but never Pitt (I didn’t check this too carefully). Also this had Donald Sutherland, who is a personal favorite. I appreciate that none of the things in space made sound at least. Sad dads in space. It was pretty, and exciting, but ultimately didn’t really give me much to latch onto.\nReady or Not\nLol can\u0026rsquo;t wait to never get remarried. Rich people are the worst. Also it\u0026rsquo;s a real bummer that \u0026ldquo;satanists\u0026rdquo; get such a bad wrap in a world where the christians are the ones actually harming children. Fuck the satanic panic\nKnives Out\nSadly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling great so I missed a bit of this, but I think I got all the important bits. I really want to see this again in the near future. The overall tone of the film was fantastic, and the comedic hits were delightful.\nSecond time emphasized how excellent this film was. A really great ride.\nFast Color\nThe preview of this movie had me hoping it was a potential adaptation of NK Jeminson\u0026rsquo;s Broken Earth trilogy, but alas, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. Fortunately, it was still a fun movie about family and mutant powers. I wish there was a little more substance to the whole film, but on the upside, the mood was pretty interesting. Also it\u0026rsquo;s weird seeing a belter as a sheriff (please see the Expanse for more details).\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives\nI’ve had this on my to-watch list for years, and finally decided to dive in. It was a beautiful and strange mediation on life, death, and family.\nTerminator: Dark Fate\nA nice return to form. This felt like a nice natural extension to Terminator 2, and while it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a great film by any means, it was a fun romp with lots of goofy jokes, explosions, and Mackenzie Davis.\nEdge of Tomorrow\nThis was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the Incomparables. I have a special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but it’s very fun.\nIn the Shadow of the Moon\nA mid-flight watch on my way to Tokyo. Pretty interesting, engaging flick that gets weird.\nParasite\nThere isn’t a lot I can say about this without spoiling the whole endeavor, but suffice it to say this movie is incredible. There’s so much going on in every shot, and the actors performances are incredible. This is a rare movie that just keeps building and building throughout. Truly one of the best directors working.\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\nA rewatch of an utter classic of mockumentary. So many quotable lines and absurdly delightful scenes. The last word in vampire media.\nThe Art of Self Defense\nThe dialog delivery was definitely from the Yorgos Lanthimos school of deadpan, and the general vibe was extremely absurdist. I loved this film. Quite a bit of this movie was unexpected, and had me cracking up. A genuinely odd delight.\nThe Day Shall Come\nAn utterly bizarre and fantastic satire about the very real lengths the state goes to in order to prop up folks with no real chance of committing “terrorist acts”. It’s worrying watching this interview to get more behind the scenes of this film. Morris makes seriously strange stuff, and this is no exception.\nHigh Life\nSpace dads! I don’t know if this is a genre, but perhaps it should be since Interstellar, High Life, and Ad Astra all appear to answer: \u0026ldquo;what if dads, but in space\u0026rdquo;. However there was a lot of assault in this film\u0026hellip; it’s largely about felons being jettisoned into space, and artificial insemination experiments, it turns out. If you like very grim space movies, this might be for you.\nPromare\nA wild visual ride with a rather bizarre (it’s Trigger, naturally) story of fire people and the folks who fight them. There’s mecha, tons of goofy jokes, and even though it felt a little long, it was fun.\nEighth Grade\nThe idea of this movie made me very anxious. Middle school is rough, and I was on edge for most of the film wondering if something very bad would happen, or if Checkov\u0026rsquo;s AR-15 would reappear. Spoiler Alert No. There\u0026rsquo;re definitely some sad moments, and some very tender and sweet ones, but no one big terrible event occurs. This isn\u0026rsquo;t that kind of movie. Instead, Eighth Grade perfectly encapsulates how nervous and awkward we felt in our youth, and just how embarassed we were by our parents. I loved it.\nBetween Two Ferns\nI love the parallel world of these bizarre and failed actors. I haven’t seen very many episodes of the web show, but this was pretty fun.\nAniara\nTL;DR: Low-budget sci-fi cruise ship. This movie reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode, at least in its premise. I really enjoy movies where something goes horribly awry, and \u0026ldquo;what if we\u0026rsquo;re stuck in space forever\u0026rdquo; definitely meets that criteria, but unlike the Twilight Zone, there\u0026rsquo;s no big twist, just a slow sadness. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain charm to the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s Swedish as well. Plus, there’s space lesbians. We’re everywhere.\nMega Time Squad\nCompletely silly and fun. Low-budget time travel movies are often awesome (think Primer), but what if it was also a very low-brow comedy? Sweet as.\nBooksmart\nWow, I really should\u0026rsquo;ve watched this in the theater. This movie ruled. Outstanding cast, hilarious from start to finish. I want so many more amazing comedies that center rad women. More. Lesbian. Characters. In. Everything.\nSteven Universe: The Movie\nI\u0026rsquo;m not super fond of musicals, and this was most certainly a musical. Generally, I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed Steven Universe, but more so when it\u0026rsquo;s weird, and not saccharine. This movie leaned more towards the latter, so it was cute, but not really my bag. If singing and supportive friendships are your favorite part of the show, you\u0026rsquo;ll love the movie. TL;DR your ex\u0026rsquo;s polycule adopts you.\nGodzilla: King of Monsters\nRidiculous, but exactly what I expected. A bit of Godzilla, a bit of the Core. I\u0026rsquo;m fascinated by the idea that \u0026ldquo;eco-terrorists\u0026rdquo; have wide-reaching military power, lol. Shin Godzilla is still the best movie in the series, hands down, but this was a silly action romp.\nMI-5\nI fondly remember the British show Spooks, which ended in 2011. This movie was a nice reminder of the great things about that silly spy show.\nBattle Angel Alita\nI read this comic when I was younger, and it’s kind of neat to see it made into a live action film. I still can’t get over the uncanny valley eyes that Rose Salazar’s character had, or the goofy \u0026ldquo;love story\u0026rdquo;. Overall, this was a fun action film.\nThe Predator\nI’ve seen folks watching this on a bunch of planes in the past year or so, and as a long-time fan of the Predator, I entered into it grudgingly. The first two films were tight thrillers, but at this point, I can’t tell what the series wants to be. If you can watch this for free, I guess it’s ok?\nBad Times at the El Royale\nThis was fun enough, with a pretty good ensemble cast. Nothing really stuck out as excellent, and in a few ways it felt like a less-ambitious Tarantino film.\nThe Quake\nA good reminder that disaster movies don’t need to have the glitz and glam of a big budget Hollywood film. This sequel to The Wave was rather slowly-paced, but exciting as it picked up steam.\nKilling of a Sacred Deer\nWow, this was an eerie film. At this point I’ve enough of Yorgos Lanthimos’ films that I enter into them thinking “what’s the strange twist?” This film delivered on that quite well. I love the strange, flat performance Lanthimos actors provide—they lure you into this world with everything just a bit off. Also the young man in the film was haunting.\nFirst Reformed\nI went into this movie thinking \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s about religion and maybe climate change\u0026rdquo;. That covers it to a degree, but beyond that is so much truth and sadness. This was a grim, beautiful film that struck me right at the core—both as an ex-religious person, and someone who often mourns for the end of life for so many folks effected by climate change. The movie, at it\u0026rsquo;s core, asks if there\u0026rsquo;s any forgiveness for our destruction of the planet, for our destruction of humanity. I don\u0026rsquo;t have an answer to that question. This film however, was excellent.\nThe Lobster\nI can now say that I have indeed considered the Lobster. After seeing The Favourite earlier this year, I decided to go back to watch Yorgos Lanthimos‘ other films. I’m glad I did. This was fantastic.\nThe Ceremony (儀式)\nA bizarre 70s Japanese film about family, duty, and incest. Reading about this film, it seems like much of it was meant to be an indictment of the older generation, as well as the younger generation’s unwillingness to speak out against tradition. As a film, it’s truly strange, but also brutal in its methodical breakdown of the protagonist.\nHobbs \u0026amp; Shaw\nA very silly buddy comedy. They talk about balls a bit too often for a movie with two 50 year old protagonists, but it was fun at times. There’s very little connection between this and Fast \u0026amp; Furious, but if you like Stratham \u0026amp; The Rock, you’ll have fun.\nThe Farewell\nI cried a lot during this film. Awkwafina did a fantastic job, and it\u0026rsquo;s cool to see a major US release mostly in Mandarin. If you\u0026rsquo;ve recently lost a grandparent, or have gone through family illness, this might just hit you really hard.\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\nThis was a very strange movie, even by Tarentino\u0026rsquo;s standards. A mix of fake show clips, stories of a man and his valet, and glimpses into the Manson family. I laughed quite a bit, and generally found this movie to be a blast.\nA Vigilante\nThis was hard to watch. It was very well done, and intensely paced, but the abuse in the films was painful. There’s a grim morality in this film, and a certain catharsis in seeing abusers punished, but fuck.\nThoroughbreads\nA fantastically creepy film about ennui and friendship. I loved it.\nSpiderman: Far from Home\nThis is exactly what I want from a superhero movie: fun. The stakes were much smaller than an Avengers movie, despite this film happening in the aftermath of both the “blip” and many deaths, and that’s a good thing. Instead of world-changing events, we got to enjoy Peter and his classmates goofing around in Europe, and the zany world of Mysterio. I loved this movie. The action was exciting, and the jokes were silly and fun.\nHospitalitié (歓待)\nA strange movie reminiscent of a short story I read years ago where. house guests slowly take over a family’s home. It’s dark, funny, and a poignant commentary on xenophobia.\nMidsommar\nWow. What a gorgeous, twisted, wild film. From the music to the ultra-bright summer of it all, I loved this movie. If you’re quite squeamish, give it a pass. Otherwise, skål!\nForce Majeure\nA slow burn of a movie. Largely, this is about a family, and a father who is kind of a shit. Tormund from GoT shows up. Lots of skiing. Grey fog. Fin.\nRalph Breaks the Internet\nThis was super cute, with a nice mix of weird jokes and internet references. It’s wild how many amazing actors they got to join in the strange fun. If you liked the first film, you’ll enjoy the new one.\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix\nThis movie wasn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as critics have said, which isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a ringing endorsement. Out of thetwo treatments of the Dark Phoenix, I think this one was better. The story was a bit odd, but overall, it was fun and a lot of shit blew up. B- summer pap.\nStarfish\nA largely solo trek through grief, loneliness, and the end of the world. The soundtrack to Starfish was excellent, as was the performance of Ginny Gardner. Without spoiling anything, it’s best to say this movie goes in interesting directions and is shot beautifully.\nWandering Earth\nThis is the second-highest grossing film in Chinese cinematic history. I’ve heard about this book for a while, and conceptually it’s interesting to think about the Earth moving instead of colony ships leaving, but it’s frustrating that Chinese censors meant that the themes of the film are somewhat limited. The end result felt more like The Core than Star Wars, and overall it was rather disappointing.\nJohn Wick 3\nRidiculous from start to finish. The fights were fun, the plot moved forward at a fast clip, and this is one of my favorite silly action franchise.\nLego Movie: Part 2\nFun, but didn’t match up to the sheer weird joy of the first movie.\nDetective Pikachu\nHilarious and so, so fun. This was definitely a kids movie, but aimed solidly at kids who’re 28-35 now—my generation has the funds to relive our childhoods in cinema. I played a few Pokémon games, and watched the cartoon for a little while in middle school, and seeing all of the Pokémon I know flitting around the screen was a hoot. Ryan Reynolds did some fantastic Pikachu voice acting, matched by the incredible CGI of his fur. One of the sillier, funnier movies I’ve seen in a minute. “My clues!”\nBurning\nIt’s been years since I read the story that this movie was inspired by, so I barely remember it. The pacing of Burning was slow, but each shot was artful, and each scene a strange delight. Also, the ambling, slightly clueless protagonist seemed to fit right in to Murakami world.\nArctic\nThis was in a really intense movie about how fucking cold it can get in the Arctic, and how scary it is to be crashed there. I like to think that this is somehow an extension of the Hannibal universe, and that in order to escape capture he became a pilot.\nAvengers:Endgame\nThis was like three movies jammed into one. It was fine, but I hope they stop doing the massive super hero stuff for a while.\nHagazussa\nBizarre and utterly obsessed with liquids. Hard to watch, but also beautiful at times.\nStill Walking\nA delightful meditation on family. I watched an earlier Koreeda movie called Nobody Knows just after college, and it destroyed me. I mostly forgot about this director until Shoplifters last year, and damn, I loved that film too. I think i only have the emotional wherewithal to watch something he made every few months, but each time I dive into his world, there’s an incredible depth to how he shows the small ways we love and lose each other. Also it’s wild to see You-san in an acting role, and not on the Terrace House couch.\nLittle\nI don’t know where to start with this weird mess of a movie. It was super funny at times, but left a lot on the cutting floor, had an utterly bizarre trans “joke”, and the worst driving scenes I’ve seen. At the same time, it was goofy, cute, and a man behind us loudly said, “that’s her when she was little”.\nGlass\nWell, I’ve finished Shyamalan’s weird comic trilogy. I remember watching Unbreakable in the theater at the mall near my house as a kid. I’d don’t know if that mall even exists anymore, but for a while, you could go to the arcade downstairs, and then watch a movie in the theater near the food court. I was straight-up enamored with Shyamalan at the time. Sixth Sense was fresh on my mind, and Unbreakable was bizarre, but hinted at something wild. Subsequent movies took this M. Night from a must watch icon, to an amusing auteur, and I think that’s great. The Happening is a movie I deeply love, but this trilogy never really lived up to either the mystery or weirdness of his best work. I think in an effort to make a meta-comic movie, he made something that ultimately doesn’t deliver much past a so-so premise that heroes do exist. Which, is fine, but isn’t “he was dead the whole time,” or “the plants!”\nThe Night is Short, Walk on Girl\nThis movie is gorgeous, which is to be expected from one of Yusuke Nakamura’s works. The plot is pretty bonkers, and includes everything from strange gods, rare alcohols, and a collection of Classical Japanese porn. If you like this, you might also love Tatami Galaxy from the same folks. There’s a certain spiritual similarity to Tampopo in this film’s over-the-top appreciation for food and drinks too.\nTampopo\nThis was a really fun movie about how amazing food can be. Tons of literal and figurative porn scenes about noodles, eggs, and more. The western film style is kinda wacky and silly, but the overall tone was interesting. I was a bit out of it when I watched this film, so I missed some of it, but likely this\u0026rsquo;ll be a rewatch.\nUs\nSuper spooky. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the combination of very good dad jokes, incredibly talented actors, and tight pacing kept this film feeling scary and fun throughout. There’s twists and turns, and a very good boat name or two. See this movie. I’m stoked we get to see more of Peele’s work in the future.\nProspect\nWhat a cool movie. This tense space flick proved that you can do a lot of sci-fi stuff with less budget. I love media about shitty tech, and this is kind of “what happens when you’re a skint space prospector” angle down pat. This could’ve been a weird Cowboy Bebop live action, but instead tackled the idea from a different angle. Sophie Thatcher rules, too. Wherever this was shot, it was gorgeous.\nCaptain Marvel\nSuper fun! Brie Larson made for a very compelling super hero, and I love Goose with my whole heart. The 90s throwback setting was a delight, along with its soundtrack. I’m stoked to see what this sets up for future Marvel films, and hopeful that we see the Skrull again (please show up in Runaways).\nFlavors of Youth\nAn alright film about the things we leave behind as we grow older, and the tastes and regrets we have. Most of this film is set in China, which is an interesting place to hear all the characters speak Japanese. There are three vignettes, and none really tugged my heartstrings, but it was still a well done movie.\nAnna and the Apocalypse\nA high-school musical with zombies. I really don’t like musicals, to be honest. I’d heard good things about this one though, and wanted to give it a chance. The cast is doing a pretty good job throughout, though the relatively one-dimensional characters of the “hot jock” and the “asshole headmaster” are schlocky. This movie mostly made me want to watch Sean of the Dead again, which used rock music to better effect.\nPolar\nMads Mikkelsen got his Takeshi Kitano take-no-prisoners action role. This movie was adapted from a comic, and it feels just like a comic, down to the choppy dialogue, fast-paced action, and dead-simple plot. It’s kinda fun, if you can get over the copious amounts of cartoonish murder.\nPiercing\nWeird. I read this book probably 10 years ago, and enjoyed it. The movie is a lighter adaptation, as it’s trickier to capture internal dialogue on film. Mia Wasikowska is outstanding as usual. I also enjoyed the general 70s aesthetic, and the cool selection of lingerie. This film only clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes, but manages to build and release tension a few times.\nSpy\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why I slept on this film. I guess I like Paul Fieg movies? This is delightful fare from Melissa Mcarthy, and a solid supporting cast.\nClose\nNoomi Rapace is a badass bodyguard in this short, high-action thriller. The “rich girl who eventually learns she needs help” is a long-standing trope, but it’s plays well here. This movie takes place in a weird parallel reality wherein everyone uses Blackberrys. Shout out to Indira Varma too, who was great in Luther, Game of Thrones, and now as a potentially treacherous stepmom.\nIO\nAnother great eco-pocalypse movie. Limited cast and locations, but a cool premise overall. This movie was short, but definitely hit many of my speculative fiction check marks. I want to ride an ATV now.\nVox Lux\nI loved the intense opening scenes of this film, and the scrolling credits—I’ve rarely seen something like this, and it felt brutal and fresh. Sadly the rest of the film felt like an idea that they forgot to film. Was she the devil? Didn’t explore that. Single mom? Didn’t explore that. There was so much buildup with no payoff. Terrorists? Nah. Long song b-roll? Yep. Even Sia couldn’t be bothered to record anything great for this film. Missed opportunity. This could‘be been Wicked and Divine, the movie.\nDestroyer\nAnother film with Tony Kebbell—seeing him in this after seeing him in Hurricane Heist was a wild ride. I think his American accent got better. Also, Kusama seemed pretty obsessed with Kidman’s face throughout this film. This was a intense sad cop/revenge film, with elements from many old sad cop guy films—transformed into something new by letting the old cop be a woman. I really appreciated the Halt \u0026amp; Catch Fire alumni, as well as the always delightful Tatiana Maslany. This movie felt like a different era, and painted LA in a grim, dusty light.\nShoplifters\nWhat a fantastic film. In some ways this reminded me of the anime Tokyo Godfathers—which is also about a group of underground folks taking in a child. The way Shoplifters weaved chosen family in with delightful vignettes and outstanding performances by two children was masterful. This felt like a Japan that rarely appears in cinema—a group of folks struggling with poverty, and not sure how to be part of a society that seems to expect them to join in. I will probably rewatch this, and highly recommend it.\nHurricane Heist\nI knew going in that this would be a bonkers film, having listened to the How Did This Get Made episode about it, but wow. Everyone in this film except for Maggie Grace is from England or Australia, and their accents are absurd. I feel like everyone got drunk, decided to use an “Alabama accent” and then a movie happened. Nothing that happened made sense, but also it was a hoot.\nAssasination Nation\nI’m still not sure what I saw. I think this aims to be a cautionary tale about mob rule, privacy, and misogyny. It’s brutal, graphic, and so full of -isms, I can’t say I recommend it. It’s wild that this movie played in theaters. I’m kinda stoked Hari Nef got to be a mean teen trans lady. By the end there’s a revenge bloodbath that I can’t tell if I was meant to find cathartic, or sad. This is definitely the most misanthropic and nihilistic movie I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in years.\n2018 Hearts Beat Loud\nI cried through a lot of this, because the dad was so good. A+ always here for rebellious lesbian daughters with amazing musical talent and cool girlfriends. Also here for every person in the cast, and a random Jeff Tweedy cameo. Also Best American Girl was a dope song/Puberty 2 was an amazing album. I will rewatch this.\nBird Box\nSpooky fun times. A bit of Blindness, a bit of the Happening, and a bit of Sandra Bullock. This was a star vehicle, with lots of randomly awesome small characters. Worth a watch, especially if you’re already a Netflix person.\nSpider-Man: Into the Spiderverse\nSuch a fun, silly movie. I recently played the Spider-Man PS4 game, so it was cool to see Miles return. Also, I’m a fan of Spider-Gwen, and I’m stoked she got a movie appearance. The whole theater was cracking up for over half of the film, and then it got a little serious and action-y. I really hope they make another one of these. The animation was wild, and super original too.\nThe Favourite\nA lesbian triumph. Olivia Coleman had me laughing constantly with her performance as the queen, and Rachel Weiss \u0026amp; Emma Stone were a delight. This movie was a bizarre, hilarious, and strangely shot film; using fisheye lenses, and lots of smooth pans on a rail made for a truly odd experience. There was quite a bit of creative anachronism, and some very adorable ducks. Easily one of the best movies I saw this year.\nThe Equalizer: 2\nThis is apparent the first sequel Denzel has ever made. I’ve loved the genre of Denzel as an ultraviolent avenging angel ever since I saw Man on Fire. Some folks may prefer John Wick, and granted, those movies have a great style, but damn, the Equalizer is a series I hope to see more of in the future.\nThe Death of Stalin (rewatch)\nIt’s the season for rewatching films.\nSlice\nSuper goofy horror film with lots of great folks. I think B movies can only rarely be made great from the start, and this one could’ve used a little less effort.\nThe Fast \u0026amp; the Furious (rewatch)\nA few friends hadn’t watched this before, so we drank a bit, and had a rip-roaring good time seeing this again. Everyone is decked-out in the most late 90s gear, the camera work is bonkers, and the cars are cool, but painted like awful hot wheels. I love this series.h\nHereditary\nGranted, the central twist was spoiled for me, but so much of this movie felt joyless. Theoretically this movie should’ve been right up my alley, but honestly I would’ve rather rewatched the VVitch for the umpteenth time.\nWidows\nThis was one of my favorite movies of the year. Wow. A all badass lady heist movie with actual stakes! Everyone delivers in this film, and it was a hoot. A+\nCrazy Rich Asians\nThis was a schlocky romcom about a very rarefied set of Chinese Singaporeans. It was fun enough, and now both of the people I saw it with want to flood the aisle of a building during their wedding. Moms are a lot.\nGirl with a Dragon Tattoo (rewatch)\nMy partner hasn’t seen these, and I would watch them again basically whenever, so here we are.\nAnt Man and the Wasp (rewatch)\nJust as delightful the second go-round. More fun superhero movies please.\nSkyscraper\nSo, so ridiculous and terrible\u0026hellip; but also kind of great? Like, what if Die Hard wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good, and had the Rock in Hong Kong? I watched this so I could listen to this week\u0026rsquo;s How Did This Get Made, and I am glad I did.\nThe Girl in the Spider\u0026rsquo;s Web\nWe\u0026rsquo;re on our third Lisbeth actress, and while Claire Foy more than filled the shoes of Rooney Mara, the same can\u0026rsquo;t quite be said for whoever replaced Daniel Craig. This was a fun, twisty movie, that was inadvertently stressful for my partner because of all the snow and ice driving. Lisbeth continues to deliver her brand of justice, while \u0026ldquo;then Lisbeth hacks the thing\u0026rdquo; is a major plot device. Kudos to all the lesbians in this, and the giant case of dildos. Fun movie.\nThe Guilty\nA wild single-room movie, that takes place completely over the phone. I love the narrative device, and the slow, dread-filled pacing. The movie largely takes place in your own imagination, helped along by excellent foley, and voice acting.\nThe First Purge\nYow, what a good mess. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I love the Purge films, and to be honest, this one felt a little too real. However, I watched this on Halloween, so it fit my needs of a spooky, scary movie.\nHalloween (2018)\nThis was goofy and fun, while still being a twisty thriller. Ultimately, these are morality tales about private property ownership, lol. A+ to Jamie Lee Curtis, and also all the random bit players. Definitely a good popcorn flick with friends.\nHalloween\nA spooky throwback to get ready for the sequel. I guess they made a bunch of these and they were all garbage, and the new movie aims to erase them. I think somehow the only one I\u0026rsquo;d seen was Season of the Witch, which is the 3rd movie in the original set. The 70s were a weird time, and the amount of nudity random \u0026ldquo;gotta take my clothes off\u0026rdquo; is just yikes. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the pacing of the new film is more up to modern standards though, because dang, did this feel dated and slow in a lot of ways.\nHotel Artemis\nFrom the preview, I assumed this would be a John Wick knockoff, but it was fun in its own right. Lots of action, Jenny Slate, and a wide array of solid actors. The future is a dismal one, but hey, that checks out.\nBeirut\nWhat if John Hamm\u0026rsquo;s Mad Men character was a state department guy turned negotiator? 70s Beirut is a trip in the way it\u0026rsquo;s presented, and knowing a little history, this seems like a wild but semi-accurate portrayal of all the folks who fought over Lebanon during and after the civil war. This is a tonally dark political thriller, and I dug it.\nVenom\nWhat a perfectly odd anti-hero film. I was a big Venom fan as a kid, and this movie delivered everything I wanted in a Venom movie. Fuck the haters, this is a hoot. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this should win any prizes for cinema but it\u0026rsquo;s fun, and provided lots of awkward laughs. The action was exciting, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for a sequel full of carnage.\nSicario: Day of the Solado\nAnother ridiculous action film about \u0026ldquo;the cartels\u0026rdquo; that I can\u0026rsquo;t honestly tell is meant to make folks dislike the US or root for us. If you want to watch Cable/Thanos run around and shoot things, this is probalby a good movie for you. I don\u0026rsquo;t find these very clever, but mostly I wish we got an Equalizer-style movie focused on Benecio Del Toro\u0026rsquo;s character. While I\u0026rsquo;m hoping, perhaps Demián Bichir can be in the third movie.\nMandy\nA weirdo pyschadelic mess of a movie. I hate that a woman\u0026rsquo;s death is used as a catalyst, but beyond that this is a bloody, ridiculous revenge flick. The music is great throughout and perhaps we were all delirious, but my theater laughed quite a bit.\nDawn of the Dead (2004/Rewatch)\nI could watch this every year. This is an excellent remake of an excellent zombie film. Everyone gives their all, and so many of the deaths, kills, and twists are perfect. A+ work from before Zach Snyder made cruddy films.\nA Simple Favor\nWhat a silly, fun movie. It ends up in kind of a weird, messy state by the end, as if Feig is like \u0026ldquo;wait, what if they don\u0026rsquo;t remember I made Bridesmaids?!?\u0026rdquo;, but I generally enjoyed seeing Blake Lively be a cool babe, while Anna Kendrick does her thing. All the side-characters were fun, and even though it felt long, it was also consistently enjoyable.\nBlindspotting\nThis is the third movie I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this year that was shot in Oakland, and I loved it. There is so much intensity, and so many parts that made me hold my breath, but everyone in this, especially Daveed Diggs, just showed-up and did an outstanding job. The criticism of gentrification in this felt more present and painful than Sorry to Bother You, and the raw emotional energy between family and friends here was so good.\nThe Nun\nLol, this ridiculous series. My friend got me into this while I was recovering from a surgery last year by asking me to watch all the preceding movies before we went to see one of the Annabelle ones. This series delivers spooky times, jump-scares, and a universe completely devoid of a loving god. I\u0026rsquo;m always down for a movie where the evil folks win, and this series is suitably unclear about who actually comes out on top, so I just claim it for the demons.\nThe Endless\nWhat a bizarre, fantastic film. I loved the world and magic of this movie, as well as the general sense of eerie inevitably. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see the previous film as well. The shots of this film are a mix of dutch angles, handheld, and some neat CGI. There\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit of upsetting stuff in this film, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a fun ride.\n47 Meters Down\nMandy Moore has never scuba-dived, but on a vacation to Mexico, her asshole friend convinces her to scuba in a cage with sharks to forget a man. It goes about as poorly as you’d think. I loved every claustrophobic minute of this. Fuck the ocean, I’m sticking to the rivers and the lakes that I’m used to.\nMary and the Witch\u0026rsquo;s Flower\nA cute anime about a young girl who stumbles into the world of witchcraft. Very reminiscent of Howl\u0026rsquo;s Moving Castle, but with a less encompassing world.\nDen of Thieves\nA heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop well. He was definitely believable as \u0026ldquo;the guy who treats everyone like shit, but we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to believe he is a very good dad who just loves his daughters.\u0026rdquo; The plot was decently executed, but it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just a movie with lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the couch.\nMasterminds\nA ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason Sudekis. It\u0026rsquo;s about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality physical comedy.\nBook Club\nWatched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great? I love Candace Bergen from the Murphy Brown days, and hope I look as good as Diane Keaton when I\u0026rsquo;m older. Silly popcorn fun. Also I guess I own it now because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t available to rent.\nThe Meg\nWow. This is my new favorite sea-based movie. What an epically hilarious film. A+ good job everyone.\nMission Impossible Fallout\nA wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I love this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and passionately.\nReady Player One\nI blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch. It was just as bad as I thought it would be, but blessedly we could make good jokes throughout.\nDrive Angry\nThere are probably worse Nic Cage movies, but this is the worst one I\u0026rsquo;ve seen. Every scene is painfully bad.\nTomb Raider\nFun, and very surprisingly entertaining for a video game movie. Lots of \u0026ldquo;oh, I could see how this would play in the game,\u0026rdquo; scenes. Alicia Vikander is a much better Lara Croft too, imo.\nSorry to Bother You\nThis is the movie Idiocracy wishes it were. Sorry to Bother You skewers tech culture, bay-area poverty, racial injustice, and so much more. Throughout, Tessa, Lakeith, and the rest of the cast deliver awesome performances. A mix of chilling and laugh-inducing. One of the best films I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this year.\nTragedy Girls\nWhat a wild, fucked-up movie about social media, murder, and friendship. Don\u0026rsquo;t do it for the gram.\nI, Tonya\nFinally watched this with a friend, and wow, it was good but full of very violent abuse stuff. Growing up in the 80s/90s, Tonya Harding was in a lot of news, but this definitely filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of her story.\nVillainess\nWhat a wonderfully bonkers movie. It kicks off with wild first-person murder fest, and just goes off-the-rails from there. One of the bloodier and wilder action films I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a long time. Loved it.\nThe Incredibles 2\nWatched this a few hours after the first one. The animation has gotten a LOT better, even though the first one honestly aged pretty well, since they didn\u0026rsquo;t try to make it photorealistic. The plot was ridiculous again, and they definitely leaned hard into the \u0026ldquo;men are bad at childcare\u0026rdquo; shit that I suspected they would. Fun enough though anyways.\nThe Incredibles\nThe animation holds up surprisingly well for a few year-old movie, even if the plot depends on some pretty annoying misogynist tropes. I watched this to prep for the new movie, and overall it was a fun, if ridiculous, movie.\nAnt Man \u0026amp; the Wasp\nThis was a hoot. Very silly, and pretty PG, but above all else, this felt like a comic movie. I\u0026rsquo;d compare this to Spiderman Homecoming or a less stylish Thor Ragnarok. Great summer night movie.\nSicario\nWhat a wild movie, in which I needed to completely suspend all of my feelings about America, the \u0026ldquo;drug war\u0026rdquo; and Thanos. If you can attempt to not emotionally connect to the actual monsters in this movie, it\u0026rsquo;s kinda fun in a \u0026ldquo;tense film where things blow up\u0026rdquo; kind of way.\nGemini\nLesbian murder mystery? Yes. This was fun, even if the music felt super weird at times. Good bangs. Cool cars. A movie where men are the worst. Also this seems consistent with the choices and habits of geminis, so, lol. shots fired.\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\nLol, this movie was absurd. They rushed off the island and so many of the subplots never really paid off? I can\u0026rsquo;t forget that Pratt is a conservative, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really care much about anyone in this film, except for the dinosaurs. I guess I was rooting for the dinosaurs, and I figure they probably came out ahead.\nOh Lucy!\nThis movie ruled! The world feels pretty rough these days, and this movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t shy away from difficult topics, but the overarching feeling of Oh Lucy is a kind and happy one. It was also cool seeing an actor I\u0026rsquo;ve watched in lots of Kiyoshi Kurasawa films show up in a very rad role.\nOcean\u0026rsquo;s 8\nAll. Ladies. Heist. A+. I hope everyone involved in this comes out as gay. Points for literally every outfit, and double points for Rhianna\u0026rsquo;s devil-may-care overalls, and Cate Blanchett\u0026rsquo;s Carol-as-a-Timelord character.\nxx\nTerrible title unless everyone involved had to get a karyotype test to be involved. Most of the horror was related to having kids, which meant this movie hit me hard, because kids are the worst and deeply frightening on the best days.\nUnlocked\nI\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for middling spy movies, and Noomi Rapace, so I now own this film. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t great, but it was fun, and dammit, sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s all I need. TIL Michael Douglas is still around.\nRed Sparrow\nI will never believe for one second that the protagonist would fall for Joel Edgerton\u0026rsquo;s bland spyman. For some reason, I expected this movie to be set during the cold war, but instead it\u0026rsquo;s vaguely now. This had more sexual assault than I expected too, which is a fucking bummer. The saving grace in this film is that by and large Jennifer Lawrence kills or beats all the men in the movie. I can only hope she gets cast in more movies where she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to participate in misogynist porn first.\nAppropriate Behavior\nThis was a fun movie about being a Persian Bisexual woman in NYC. Shirin goes through a major breakup, then struggles to date, and heal, while dealing with a family she doesn\u0026rsquo;t think will understand her queerness, and the strange world of the NYC queer and poly scene. I laughed out loud during a lot of this, even as I scratched my head at the confusing references to trans guys—like, why are they a joke? Overall, I dug this movie, and hope the director/writer Desiree makes more films soon.\nSolo\nThis was probably tied with Last Jedi for my least favorite of the new Star Wars, but I liked it better than pretty much any of the old or prequel ones. It was fun, had a few rad women, and didn\u0026rsquo;t go overboard on \u0026ldquo;remember this?\u0026rdquo; fanservice. I laughed a few times, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they make sequels.\nDeadpool 2\nAs fun as Avengers: Infinity War was boring and meh. Full of silly jokes. There were definitely jokes that were in really poor taste, but pretty much what I expected.\nAvengers: Infinity War\nThis movie tried to tie together too many disparate stories, to bland effect. The attempt at some sort of emotional climax was a big wet fart, despite ten people in the theater I was in yelling at the screen. Like, spoilers they\u0026rsquo;ll all be back, bc Disney isn\u0026rsquo;t going to kill off their money-makers. Go rewatch Black Panther of Thor Ragnarok, or like, spend 3 hours outside instead.\nIn the Fade\nOne of the saddest movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s gorgeous, well-shot, and soundtracked, but phew, what a brutal movie about the evils of nazism, and racism.\nGeostorm\nA trash movie in the best way. If you liked watching Jake Gylenhall run from ice in The Day After Tomorrow, and people saying \u0026ldquo;zap!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;geostorm!\u0026rdquo;, then this movie is for you. Continues the trend of big-budget action films being largely targeted for non-US success, but that means we also get some cool co-stars.\nA Quiet Place\nA \u0026ldquo;good christian family\u0026rdquo; who loves gender roles has to be vewwwwwy quiet so they don\u0026rsquo;t get eaten by some kind of creatures. This movie was silly as fuck. Every time the monster was on screen, someone had to pantomime \u0026ldquo;be quiet,\u0026rdquo; as if the entire movie hadn\u0026rsquo;t been quiet. Also spoilers but how the fuck do you get pregnant if you know that a baby is going to make loud baby noises and get your family killed? And where did they fuck? Anyways, this is a hate-watch.\nThe Descent\nAnother \u0026ldquo;maybe these are bad people\u0026rdquo; everything-goes-wrong movie. This was a rewatch, and yet, the cave scenes still had me feeling super claustrophobic. It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that I was in the middle of a middle row on a plane to Portland from Amsterdam when I watched it.\nCabin Fever\nI can\u0026rsquo;t tell if this was the original, or if this was a remake, but either way, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to watch annoying and awful people fall apart. This is a theme of the previous and next movie.\nThe Ritual\nA very good \u0026ldquo;get lost in the woods\u0026rdquo; movie. Bad things happen to unlikeable men. A+.\nThe Death of Stalin\nSuper dark comedy. It has that abusive asshole Jeffrey Tambor, but otherwise is full of hilariously weird old men. If you like Veep or In the Thick of It, this is a must-watch.\nBlade\nrewatch Wesley Snipes is a half-vampire vampire hunter. It rules.\nWrinkle in Time\nI\u0026rsquo;d recommend listening to this podcast after you see the movie. It was very, very disney, and they burned through everything pretty fast without a lot of wonder. Really glad that the god stuff was gone, but I think they could have jettisoned Calvin too without losing anything.\nThelma\nA great movie about being queer, growing up Christian, and maybe having super powers. Relateable AF. Highly recommended.\nAnnihilation\nWhat a wild movie. I read these books back in 2014 when they were released in a frenzy. I was pretty constantly afraid of the house I was staying in, as I was pretty well disturbed by the book. It had the kind of sneaky quality that gets in your head. The movie did a brisker job of telling a similar story, but I enjoyed it. I\u0026rsquo;ll probalby see this again, and I\u0026rsquo;m very curious if they\u0026rsquo;ll try to make more.\nLost Boys\nI hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen this movie for a long time, but recently Imogen watched and talked about it, so my roommate and I sat down for a revisit. It held up. There\u0026rsquo;s something fantastic about watching these very gay vampire boys run around and be punk teens. Listen to Imogen\u0026rsquo;s podcast if you can, bc she says everything I\u0026rsquo;d wanna cover. Oh, and watch this movie.\nBlack Panther\nHoly shit. I thought this movie would be good, but I had no idea how amazing it would be. Action like woah, a solid plot that doesn\u0026rsquo;t dig into origin story over and over like other Marvel films, and amazing set and costume design. The array of talented actors in this film is unbelievable. This is one of the best films of 2018. No doubt.\nThe Cloverfield Paradox\nI\u0026rsquo;d heard a lot of \u0026ldquo;this movie isn\u0026rsquo;t good\u0026rdquo; from folks who hate fun, I guess. It was fun, and a pretty decent \u0026ldquo;stuff goes wrong in space\u0026rdquo; movie. I LOVE Cloverfield and even though I was mad at the gendered threat of violence that permeated the entirety of 10 Cloverfield Lane, I still enjoyed bits of that too. The Cloverfield universe is a wild one that I really enjoy. See this if you have Netflix, like seeing WoC protagonists, or like Cloverfield movies.\nI Don\u0026rsquo;t Feel at Home in This World Anymore\nElijah Wood is doing his all in this movie, as is Melanie Lynskey. This goes off the rails midway through, and becomes a thrillride, but keeps up the laughs. Also, yay for a movie that\u0026rsquo;s set in Portland.\nHunt for the Wilderpeople\nAhhh, this ruled! Sam Neil, and the kid are spectacular. Taika has a lovely cameo as a bizarre priest. This might end up being the best movie I see this year, and it had me laughing pretty consistently throughout.\nThe Raid\nMy second viewing of this movie since I saw it in theaters in Berkeley. I love how rad and amazing this tower-escape film is. The fight scenes and film style is so kinetic, and carries you through the film. There\u0026rsquo;s not a lot in the way of plot, but some of it feels like a Die Hard homage.\nThe Foreigner\nJackie Chan vs Irish James Bond. This movie kinda ruled. Jackie Chan is fantastic, even at 63, at just dominating the screen with his personality and action. This is definitely a more subdued and serious role than many of his more famous films, but he shows up and is great. Parts of this reminded me of taken, and others of name a political thriller, but overall I really enjoyed this movie.\nBattle of the Sexes\nI\u0026rsquo;d heard good things, and this was pretty fun to watch. The lesbian storyline was surprisingly compelling, and very well-done. I\u0026rsquo;m mad that Adidas didn\u0026rsquo;t reissue BJK\u0026rsquo;s signature shoe when this movie came out though. It\u0026rsquo;s a good shoe. Steve Carrell seemed like many of his other characters in this, but whatever\u0026hellip; Billy Riggs was an ass, and they do a good job of showing that.\nMurder on the Orient Express\nEveryone is acting so hard in this, and yet the result is a mess. That said, I\u0026rsquo;d watch this again just to see Branaugh\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous mustache. 10\u0026frasl;10 mustache. I saw this in Japan, so I had a beer and french fries to make it slightly better, and pre-roll video that repeated \u0026ldquo;NO NO NO\u0026rdquo; in English to admonish us for even considering texting or talking.\n2017 this list is super truncated because i forgot keep it until july\nLife\nEveryone forgets their training, acts like an ass, and gets munched by aliens. It was entertaining in a schadenfreude way.\nMoonlight\nCried through most of this. It\u0026rsquo;s about growing up black \u0026amp; gay, with a neurodiverse mom. It\u0026rsquo;s beautiful, intense, and in my top five movies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. Incredible.\nGet Out\nAt times hilarious, and others biting AF. I really loved this movie. A pitch-perfect callout of \u0026ldquo;good white folks\u0026rdquo;, like we often are.\nAlien Covenant\nAliens rule. This movie ruled. Kenny Powers flies a spaceship, and new Ridley is solid. Also Magneto is creepy AF in this.\nLogan\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like Wolverine, but better, because he\u0026rsquo;s old. Also this has Rictor, who was gay in the comics with Shatterstar. Super entertaining.\nFast \u0026amp; Furious 8\nHaven\u0026rsquo;t seen one of these? Ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a time? Start at 1, then watch 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8. I think. Anyways, this is bonkers in a perfect way.\nBlame!\nA anime movie? Yea, this series by Nihei is kinda rad, and there\u0026rsquo;s cool killer lady. It\u0026rsquo;s 3D animated, which is kinda the worst, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look horrible in this.\nRogue One\nAh, this was super good. A+ characters, fun action, and a lack of space incest! Also the robot was comic relief without being a jar jar.\nThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\nBrian Cox from that other X-Men movie and also Rushmore is a morgue-guy, like those cuties from Six Feet Under\u0026hellip; except spookier. Also I think the other guy was Spiderman.\nLego Batman\nGob Bluth is the bat. This movie is hilarious. Bonus points if you\u0026rsquo;re a DC comics nerd, or just enjoy fun.\nTrain to Busan\nSeriously one of the best zombie movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a long time. Also I love trains, and this is the best train movie since Snowpiercer.\nAliens\nUgh, this sequel to Alien was so good, and still is so good. RIP cool cat, but yay for all the rad ladies in this. Also Bishop is the only ok robot in this series.\nGuardians of the Galaxy 2\nOverall, pretty entertaining. Gomorra is cool as always. Baby Groot was less awful than I expected, and hey! Kurt Russell space dad.\nJohn Wick 2\nSo, this is more Keanu as a vengeful Denzel Washington-esque character, but not as good. I liked this movie, but also Man on Fire did it better. Well shot though! And there\u0026rsquo;s at least a nod towards ammo being a thing.\nKong: Skull Island\nWow, they just told Samuel L. Jackson to be his one character, which is a great character. Bonus points for Steve Brule.\nTremors\n\u0026ldquo;Featuring Kevin Bacon from Footloose\u0026rdquo; as the least convincing outdoor working man in a movie, ever. He and his boyfriend can\u0026rsquo;t leave town, so they end up fighting giant worms. This movie is super euphemistic, hilarious, and the best role Reba has ever had.\nShin Godzilla\nA fantastic look at how modern bureaucracy and posturing can get in the way of stopping a giant lizard. Too bad they don\u0026rsquo;t show the environmental devastation wrought by eschewing safety checks.\nYour Name\nA super cute, super straight story of love through time. Imagine if the Lake House was better, and didn\u0026rsquo;t have Keanu. It\u0026rsquo;s basically this.\nThe Girl with All the Gifts\nAnother great zombie movie, with a super cute protagonist. Cute kid zombies are great.\nRaw\nThis is literally what happens if you break vegan.\nPrometheus\nHad to rewatch this after Covenant. Still perfect. Naomi Rapace could do her taxes on film, and I\u0026rsquo;d probably be riveted. She rules.\nJustice League Dark\nI wanted this to be better. It was so-so, and seriously, Swamp Thing?\nThe Heat\nA send-up of Lethal Weapon + every buddy cop film. Mcarthy and Bullock are fantastic in this.\nKeanu\nI will watch this yearly, as it\u0026rsquo;s one of the 4 movies I own. Get high, and watch this movie about a kitten, and the men who love him.\nWicker Man\nNick Cage at his most unhinged. Well, close to it. My roommate hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen this, so I introduced her to this hilarious hellride.\nNeon Demon\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get into modeling. It\u0026rsquo;ll end badly. This movie was beautiful, gory, and wild.\nKubo\nI\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed other movies from this studio more – Coraline for one – but this was still fun.\nBaby Driver\nI\u0026rsquo;d avoided watching this because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read great things about it, save for this review by Matt Haughey. While I agree with him that the opening action scene was stellar, so were the short films BMW made with greats like Wong Kar Wai a few years ago to sell cars. I liked watching this film, but it\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate that the men were two-dimensional, and the women collapsed in on themselves, with no characterization, or much motivation. I\u0026rsquo;d expected a bit more of Edgar Wright, but on the upside, the musical cues were also quite good. I\u0026rsquo;m not fully sure if this is a tribute to old McQueen movies, or what, but it was alright, but I can\u0026rsquo;t co-sign the fantastic from the above. It was exciting, but the stakes weren\u0026rsquo;t ever high, because I never cared much about the protagonist, because I was given no reason to care. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen chases before, parkour, car work. This movie could\u0026rsquo;ve elevated them further, but it chose not to. I never believed there really was jeopardy, because as the movie, and the news of the day makes clear, \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rsquo;s such a good boy,\u0026rdquo; is something that will always apply to the white male criminal.\nValerian\nThe short version is that this was very targetted towards a Chinese release, partially due to the studio financing, and even Besson was promoting it on Weibo. I had a great time watching this movie, but it was pretty dang ridiculous, and had super traditional and boring gender roles and \u0026ldquo;marriage is the best\u0026rdquo; kind of crap. Still, the visuals were incredible, and it was a fun space romp. Recommended.\nSecret Life of Pets\nI blame my friend Andy – they wanted to watch this because they were tired and we thought it\u0026rsquo;d be cute. It was very cute, but also pretty silly. I dunno. Kids probably loved it. There\u0026rsquo;s some good cats.\nAtomic Blonde\nCharlize Theron as a queer badass assassin/spy? Sold. Because this is mainstream Hollywood, of course that doesn\u0026rsquo;t last, but still\u0026hellip; this was a fun romp. A summer movie devoid of substance, but thick and heavy with style and silliness.\nFlatliners\nKiefer oozes weird attraction in this classic about chasing the meaning of life by dying for minutes. I saw a trailer for the sequel to this, I guess, with Ellen Page, so I had to revisit the original. I loved it all over again. Spooky and silly. And, to quote my roommate, \u0026ldquo;how many Baldwins are there?!\u0026rdquo;\nThey\u0026rsquo;re Watching\nThis was goofy as hell, and was sort of a comedic Blair Witch in Moldova thing. Near the end it takes a sharp left, and we were cracking up. Worth watching on Netflix, perhaps?\n2012\nA beautifully terrible film by the guy who brought us The Day After Tomorrow. I love a movie where we\u0026rsquo;re led to believe that John Cusack is the best driver in the world, and a writer-cum-action hero. I love watching this movie when I\u0026rsquo;m camping, or hiking for a few days, because it\u0026rsquo;s so ridiculous, and also it\u0026rsquo;s wild to watch the world end, however silly the movie.\nIn This Corner of the World\nSO. MANY. TEARS. My friends and I sobbed through a lot of this film about the atrocities of World War 2, especially the destruction the United States caused in Japan. The movie follows a woman living in Hiroshima, then Kure, who grows up in the 30s and 40s, and sees her friends and loved ones suffer during the war. It\u0026rsquo;s beautiful, hilarious at times, and sad. This movie is a shift on the view that Grave of the Fireflies offers, but definitely in similar territory.\nThe Visit\nGuessed the twist about 20 minutes into this movie and i\u0026rsquo;m really proud of that because I\u0026rsquo;m usually the worst at figuring out where bad movies are headed. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust your grandparents. Don\u0026rsquo;t send your kids anywhere. Don\u0026rsquo;t ever clean your oven.\nThe Conjuring\nThis was great, until the witch didn\u0026rsquo;t win. I can\u0026rsquo;t help but think these movies are trying to get me to follow their lord and savior.\nThe Conjuring 2\nYep, these are definitely witnessing. A cool demon has a hard time with some very awful British people. Watched both of these in quick succession to get to see Annabelle 2 or whatever later on tonight.\nAnnabelle: Creation\nThis was a very silly movie with children making terrible choices. I don\u0026rsquo;t think dolls themselves are very scary, but Catholicism is definitely scary. Everyone who gets hunted by the demon or whatever was also a practicing Catholic, so maybe being a satanist or atheist would be some kinda ghost protection.\nWall-E\nOne of the best movies ever, and it\u0026rsquo;s held up super well in animation and craft. I love this robot.\nI think I watched a movie about a plague\nI was on a LOT of drugs for surgery, so I have no idea what this was called, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I saw it before?\nThe Happening\nThis fucking movie is straight-up incredible. Mark Wahlberg at his best \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just happy to be here,\u0026rdquo; and a whole lot of incredibly banal deaths. Zooey \u0026ldquo;Literal Beige Person\u0026rdquo; Deschanel is also in this for some reason. Anyways, I love that this was one of the movies we all saw, hoping for the return of that GOOD GOOD Sixth Sense action, and instead we got this beautiful god trash. Eat a pound of desert pudding and cry about humanity. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna give you\u0026hellip; a math riddle.\u0026rdquo;\nIT\nHadn\u0026rsquo;t seen it, and wow what a silly joy. Not scary at all, but I\u0026rsquo;m definitely even less trustworthy of Tim Curry now, I guess? Everyone is giving their all in this movie.\nWonder Woman\nOk, I finally saw it. I literally couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking about Gal being part of an anti-Palestian army, but once Chris Pine made me laugh by doing a bad German accent. This movie bravely asks the question: \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rsquo;s a goddess, but when will she become super saiyan?\u0026rdquo; Not particularly into this movie.\nSpiderman: Homecoming\nThis is the kind of superhero film that makes me smile. I think this is the best reboot of the Spiderman franchise, and it is filled with silly, fun moments, that emphasize the more joyful aspects of the character. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the next few. Marvel seems like they\u0026rsquo;re just going to keep making better movies than DC, save for the Nolan Batman movies. Speaking of Batman – the second best modern Batman (Michael Keaton) also plays the Vulture in this movie. Go figure. Anyways, this was a fun romp.\nIngrid Goes West\nEveryone besides Dan is terrible in this movie, and Dan is hella co-dependent. This is a biting satire of the lives folks live in pursuit of Instagram perfection.\nDeath Becomes Her\nBruce Willis, with hair! Wow. Everything about this movie is perfect. Women seeking eternal youth. Isabella Rossilini just oozing charisma and power. Inexplicable wrestling manservants. Mincing Bruce Willis. The prothesis in this movie is hella Beetlejuice. I loved it.\nNew IT\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m broken inside, because jump scares and all of the \u0026ldquo;scary\u0026rdquo; bits of this film didn\u0026rsquo;t phase me. It was at times pretty cute, but the misogyny and against the only girl in the group was the scariest thing of all. I\u0026rsquo;m interested to see what they do with the second part of this movie. The visuals were kinda neat and well-done.\nFriend Request\nWow, this movie was garbage. I ended up skipping through it because the first 20 minutes were so painful. 0 thumbs out of 20.\nThe Hitman\u0026rsquo;s Bodyguard\nSamuel L Jackson at 68 in The Hitman\u0026rsquo;s Bodyguard is doing a better job than most action guys half his age. What a goofy, fun movie. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularly smart, but it was a wonderful romp. A summer action movie through and through.\nGhost in the Shell (with ScarJo \u0026amp; white-washing)\nThe fashion was kinda neat, and some of the visuals were cool. The story seemed worse than the anime though, and I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if ScarJo can\u0026rsquo;t act, or just collected a paycheck. Bonus points to Beat Takeshi for just speaking Japanese the entire time, unlike the rest of the characters. He\u0026rsquo;s great. I hope he got paid for this trash.\nxXx: The Return of Xander Cage\nWow, this movie was over-the-top ridiculous. And the terrible coat was back from the first movie. I think this canonically takes place in the Marvel universe, because of Samuel L. Jackson. I have no idea why xXx uses \u0026ldquo;extreme sports\u0026rdquo; people, soccer stars, and a DJ(?), but here we are. I love this very, very goofy series, and bought this movie with a big grin when it was no longer available for rent. Everyone is having a blast, and it\u0026rsquo;s a multi-cultural cast that is filled with neat folks.\nBlade Runner: 2046\nDamn. This was definitely one of my favorite movies this year. Every scene was so beautiful, and skillfully art-directed. I loved that Mackenzie Davis (also from the San Junipero, the Martian, \u0026amp; Halt \u0026amp; Catch Fire) was in this too. Harrison Ford was spectacular, and somehow Ryan Reynolds didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me. The outfits ruled, and even though I wish there\u0026rsquo;d been more central roles for women, the women that were in the film were neat. I\u0026rsquo;ll own this, and watch it more than once, for sure. Now, to find some of the outfits in the film\u0026hellip;\nWhat Happened to Monday\nA movie with Noomi Rapace playing 7 different women? I\u0026rsquo;m in. Willem Dafoe was in this too. Mostly this movie was a neat dystopia with lots of twists, and even though Noomi Rapace wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite up to Tatiana Maslany\u0026rsquo;s Orphan Black performance, it\u0026rsquo;s still really, really well edited.\nLandline\nFrom the same creators as Obvious Child, which ruled, comes this movie about a family in the 90s trying to keep from imploding. Jenny Slate is great in this, and the sisterhood on display is pretty adorable. John Turturro does a great job too.\nColossal\nOh, great, a movie about white people working out their alcoholism and relationship issues while murdering folks in Korea. I dunno. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. Also damn girl, those bangs are LONG.\nBeyond the Gates\nVery silly movie about a VCR-based horror game that\u0026hellip; is really happening. A fun time for the spooky holidays.\nPitch Black\nVin\u0026rsquo;s other, other series. Vin Diesel plays the same character, but this time, he\u0026rsquo;s in a space black tank top, and his eyes glow because he can see in the dark, I guess? There\u0026rsquo;s a genderqueer-ish person in this film, but I checked and the actress is definitely a straight and feminine-presenting woman now. Was hoping Jack grew up to be a genderfucking weirdo cool kid.\nFried Green Tomatoes\nThis was charming and cute. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as gay as I wanted it to be, but was gayer than most. RIP Smokey. RIP other characters. I read the book before I saw this movie, somehow, and I missed some of the book scenes, but overall this was fun.\nThe Babysitter\nIf I\u0026rsquo;d watched this alone I would\u0026rsquo;ve turned it off after a few minutes. It was garbage. It\u0026rsquo;s like the creators of Scary Movie read Ready Player One, and thought, yea, we can do that. Terrible.\nThe VVitch\nThis movie rules. It\u0026rsquo;s about jettisoning a sex-negative, shitty family for the loving embrace of Satan and a coven of witches. The vibe is sullen AF, and very stark. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this movie five times, three of those in the theater. This was a perfect movie to watch during Samhain.\nThor: Ragnarok\nA+ super hero movie. Silly and unpretentious.\nLady Bird\nThe truest old millennial movie. I cried a lot.\nThe Room\nTerrible movie. Great rewatch. This movie is epically bad, and I hope everyone has had a chance to see the copious softcore sex scenes, and confusing \u0026ldquo;american man\u0026rdquo; football rituals.\nOkja\nA sometimes cute, sometimes very grim movie about the evils of capitalism and factory farming. The protagonist is the cutest, and is really giving her all in every scene, and Paul Dano and Jake Gylenhall manage to not spoil the movie with their characters. Steven Yuen is pretty great, and Tilda Swinton continues in her consistent \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not an alien in human skin\u0026rdquo; character from movies of yore.\nThe Disaster Artist\nWow. This movie is a parade of actors and actresses who loved the Room in all it\u0026rsquo;s weirdness. This movie falls somewhere between a tribute, a satire, and a dramatic reinterpretation documentary. I loved it. Saw this with another long-time The Room fan, and we both were in tears laughing. I will see this again. The podcast How Did This Get Made? has a great episode for this movie too that begins with their The Room episode.\nIt Follows\nThis is my second viewing, and this movie was still unbelievably creepy. I made my friend watch American Vandal with me after this to get less scared. It\u0026rsquo;s a horror film about an STI haunting. I dunno. It\u0026rsquo;s wild. Watch this, but be ready to always watch for a single, slowly-walking person in a crowd.\nRare Exports\nA perfectly weird holiday movie about the real santa.\nDie Hard\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful holiday time for everyone, except german models turned \u0026ldquo;terrorist\u0026rdquo;. Points to this one for accurately pointing out that white people are the bad guys though.\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\nHere for this. Love the porgs, and love Luke punking Kylo. This was a great combination of ridiculous and fun. I like that Rian brought more humor into the world of the star war.\n2016 Nine Lives\nNothing could redeem this absolute shitpile. We thought it would be funny to watch a movie about Kevin Spacey as a cat, but it was unbearably bad. Avoid.\n","date":"January, 0001","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/movies/","tags":null,"title":"watching"},{"categories":null,"contents":" online  Ninth Letter\nTrans New Wave\nOregon Humanities\nAlso Fire\nThe Toast\nQueer Spaces\nDating as a Trans Woman\nTransmisogyny \u0026amp; Disc Golf Roundtable\nTrans in Tech\nUses This\nUses This Interview\nMedium\nAll posts\nLittle Red Tarot\nTarot as Agency\nbooks  F, M, or Other: Quarrels with the Gender Binary\nTransfigure\nLean Out\npodcasts  I Guess We\u0026rsquo;re Grownups Now\nDear Prudence: Sept 12, 2018\nDear Prudence: Nov 2, 2016\nzines  The Most Important Zine of the Day: on Breakfast Note: You\u0026rsquo;ll need to print this out and fold it yourself\n","date":"January, 0001","permalink":"https://www.brookshelley.com/writing/","tags":null,"title":"writing"}]
